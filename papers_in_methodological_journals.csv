integrated population models: model assumptions and inference,bayesian; heterogeneity; integrated population models; model assumption violation; parameter estimation,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,RIECKE TV;WILLIAMS PJ;BEHNKE TL;GIBSON D;LEACH AG;SEDINGER BS;STREET PA;SEDINGER JS,"integrated population models (ipms) have become increasingly popular for the modelling of populations, as investigators seek to combine survey and demographic data to understand processes governing population dynamics. these models are particularly useful for identifying and exploring knowledge gaps within life histories, because they allow investigators to estimate biologically meaningful parameters, such as immigration or reproduction, that were previously unidentifiable without additional data. as ipms have been developed relatively recently, there is much to learn about model behaviour. behaviour of parameters, such as estimates near boundaries, and the consequences of varying degrees of dependency among datasets, has been explored. however, the reliability of parameter estimates remains underexamined, particularly when models include parameters that are not identifiable from one data source, but are indirectly identifiable from multiple datasets and a presumed model structure, such as the estimation of immigration using capture-recapture, fecundity and count data, combined with a life-history model. to examine the behaviour of model parameter estimates, we simulated stable populations closed to immigration and emigration. we simulated two scenarios that might induce error into survival estimates: marker induced bias in the capture-mark-recapture data and heterogeneity in the mortality process. we subsequently fit capture-mark-recapture, state-space and fecundity models, as well as ipms that estimated additional parameters. simulation results suggested that when model assumptions are violated, estimation of additional, previously unidentifiable, parameters using ipms may be extremely sensitive to these violations of model assumption. for example, when annual marker loss was simulated, estimates of survival rates were low and estimates of immigration rate from an ipm were high. when heterogeneity in the mortality process was induced, there were substantial relative differences between the medians of posterior distributions and truth for juvenile survival and fecundity. our results have important implications for biological inference when using ipms, as well as future model development and implementation. specifically, using multiple datasets to identify additional parameters resulted in the posterior distributions of additional parameters directly reflecting the effects of the violations of model assumptions in integrated modelling frameworks. we suggest that investigators interpret posterior distributions of these parameters as a combination of biological process and systematic error."
overcoming field monitoring restraints in estimating marine turtle internesting period by modelling individual nesting behaviour using capture-mark-recapture data,chelonia mydas; lepidochelys olivacea; internesting period; iteroparity; nesting abortion; eastern atlantic,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,HANCOCK J;VIEIRA S;LIMA H;SCHMITT V;PEREIRA J;REBELO R;GIRONDOT M,"marine turtles are intra-seasonal iteroparous animals; they nest from one to up to 14 times during the nesting season, laying up to 180 eggs each time. their annual reproductive effort can therefore be estimated from clutch size, nesting frequency, and length of the nesting season. moreover, the estimation of nesting frequency, usually obtained from the internesting period (i.e., the time in days between two nesting events) is essential for assessing the number of females in a population. however, the intemesting period is strongly influenced by variation in individual behaviour of the nesting female, including abortion of nesting attempts. it is also affected by imprecise detection of females during beach monitoring, often related with a lack of fidelity to the nesting beach. using an individual-focused model based on capture-mark-recapture data we were able to statistically characterize the nesting behaviour of the populations of green turtles (chelonia mydas) and olive ridley turtles (lepidochelys olivacea) in sao tome and principe (eastern atlantic). the developed model proposes a novel approach in estimating the internesting period, by including the different factors that lead to the heterogeneity observed in the duration of intemesting periods across a single season, corrected for the probability of a female aborting a nesting process. the calculated lengths of the intemesting periods for the two species are congruent with previous estimates, validating the model. furthermore, the inference of the rank of a nest for an individual female is predicted by the model with high accuracy, even when the recapture rate is low and the time between observations is long. a limitation of the model is its inability to estimate the true clutch frequency at the scale of the population but it was not its purpose."
jointly estimating survival and mortality: integrating recapture and recovery data from complex multiple predator systems,capture-recapture-recovery; hierarchical bayesian; population dynamics; state-space models,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,PAYTON Q;HOSTETTER NJ;EVANS AF,"identifying where, when, and how many animals live and die over time is principal to understanding factors that influence population dynamics. capture-recapture-recovery (crr) models are widely used to estimate animal survival and, in many cases, quantify specific causes of mortality (e.g., harvest, predation, starvation). however, the restrictive crr framework can inhibit the consideration and inclusion of some types of recovery data. we developed an extension to the crr framework to allow for the incorporation of recoveries from indeterminate temporal or spatial origin. this model jointly estimates cause-specific mortality and survival probabilities across multiple spatial and temporal scales, while accounting for differences in mortality-specific reporting and recovery rates. we fitted the model to data on a group of juvenile steelhead trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) marked with passive integrated transponder tags in the columbia river basin, usa. following tagging and release, fish were detected alive at up to six downstream locations and/or recovered dead on one of nine bird colonies during seaward migration. we estimated that, in aggregate, avian predators consumed 31% of juvenile steelhead during outmigration to the ocean (95% cri: [27, 36]). colony-specific predation rates ranged from<1 to 14% among river reaches, with avian predation accounting for>95% of all steelhead mortality within some reaches. this integrated modelling approach provides a flexible framework to integrate multiple recapture and recovery data sources, providing a more holistic understanding of animal life history, including direct comparisons of cause-specific mortality factors and the cumulative impact of multiple mortality factors across time or space."
"the identity of the zero-truncated, one-inflated likelihood and the zero-one-truncated likelihood for general count densities with an application to drink-driving in britain",capture-recapture; chao estimator; behavioral response; power series distribution; mixture model; zero-truncated model; nonparametric estimator of population size,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,BOHNING D;VAN DER HEIJDEN PGM,"for zero-truncated count data, as they typically arise in capture-recapture modelling, we consider modelling under one-inflation. this is motivated by police data on drink-driving in britain which shows high one-inflation. the data, which are used here, are from the years 2011 to 2015 and are based on dr10 endorsements. we show that inference for an arbitrary count density with one-inflation can be equivalently based upon the associated zero-one truncated count density. this simplifies inference considerably including maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio testing. for the drink-driving application, we use the geometric distribution which shows a good fit. we estimate the total drink-driving as about 2,300,000 drink-drivers in the observational period. as 227,578 were observed, this means that only about 10% of the drink-driving population is observed with a bootstrap confidence interval of 9%-12%."
efficient sequential monte carlo algorithms for integrated population models,bayesian inference; capture-recapture; integrated population models; model comparison; sequential monte carlo; state-space models,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,FINKE A;KING R;BESKOS A;DELLAPORTAS P,"in statistical ecology, state-space models are commonly used to represent the biological mechanisms by which population counts-often subdivided according to characteristics such as age group, gender or breeding status-evolve over time. as the counts are only noisily or partially observed, they are typically not sufficiently informative about demographic parameters of interest and must be combined with additional ecological observations within an integrated data analysis. fitting integrated models can be challenging, especially if the constituent state-space model is nonlinear/non-gaussian. we first propose an efficient particle markov chain monte carlo algorithm to estimate demographic parameters without a need for linear or gaussian approximations. we then incorporate this algorithm into a sequential monte carlo sampler to perform model comparison. we also exploit the integrated model structure to enhance the efficiency of both algorithms. the methods are demonstrated on two real data sets: little owls and grey herons. for the owls, we find that the data do not support an ecological hypothesis found in the literature. for the herons, our methodology highlights the limitations of existing models which we address through a novel regime-switching model. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online."
inferring animal social networks with imperfect detection,bayesian inference; capture-recapture; multistate models; social networks,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,GIMENEZ O;MANSILLA L;KLAICH MJ;COSCARELLA MA;PEDRAZA SN;CRESPO EA,"social network analysis provides a powerful tool for understanding social organisation of animals. however, in free-ranging populations, it is almost impossible to monitor exhaustively the individuals of a population and to track their associations. ignoring the issue of imperfect and possibly heterogeneous individual detection can lead to substantial bias in standard network measures. here, we develop capture-recapture models to analyse network data while accounting for imperfect and heterogeneous detection. we carry out a simulation study to validate our approach. in addition, we show how the visualisation of networks and the calculation of standard metrics can account for detection probabilities. the method is illustrated with data from a population of commerson's dolphin (cephalorhynchus commersonii) in patagonia argentina. our approach provides a step towards a general statistical framework for the analysis of social networks of wild animal populations."
population closure and the bias-precision trade-off in spatial capture-recapture,mortality; population dynamics; recruitment; spatial capture-recapture; time-to-event modelling,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,DUPONT P;MILLERET C;GIMENEZ O;BISCHOF R,"spatial capture-recapture (scr) is an increasingly popular method for estimating ecological parameters. scr often relies on data collected over relatively long sampling periods. while longer sampling periods can yield larger sample sizes and thus increase the precision of estimates, they also increase the risk of violating the closure assumption, thereby potentially introducing bias. the sampling period characteristics are therefore likely to play an important role in this bias-precision trade-off. yet few studies have studied this trade-off and none has done so for scr models. in this study, we explored the influence of the length and timing of the sampling period on the bias-precision trade-off of scr population size estimators. using a continuous time-to-event approach, we simulated populations with a wide range of life histories and sampling periods before quantifying the bias and precision of population size estimates returned by scr models. while longer sampling periods benefit the study of slow-living species (increased precision and lower bias), they lead to pronounced overestimation of population size for fast-living species. in addition, we show that both bias and uncertainty increase when the sampling period overlaps the reproductive season of the study species. based on our findings, we encourage investigators to carefully consider the life history of their study species when contemplating the length and the timing of the sampling period. we argue that both spatial and non-spatial capture-recapture studies can safely extend the sampling period to increase precision, as long as it is timed to avoid peak recruitment periods. the simulation framework we propose here can be used to guide decisions regarding the sampling period for a specific situation."
cluster capture-recapture to account for identification uncertainty on aerial surveys of animal populations,capture-recapture; neyman-scott process; palm intensity; spatial capture-recapture; thomas process; unmanned aerial vehicles,BIOMETRICS,STEVENSON BC;BORCHERS DL;FEWSTER RM,"capture-recapture methods for estimating wildlife population sizes almost always require their users to identify every detected animal. many modern-day wildlife surveys detect animals without physical capturevisual detection by cameras is one such example. however, for every pair of detections, the surveyor faces a decision that is often fraught with uncertainty: are they linked to the same individual? an inability to resolve every such decision to a high degree of certainty prevents the use of standard capture-recapture methods, impeding the estimation of animal density. here, we develop an estimator for aerial surveys, on which two planes or unmanned vehicles (drones) fly a transect over the survey region, detecting individuals via high-definition cameras. identities remain unknown, so one cannot discern if two detections match to the same animal; however, detections in close proximity are more likely to match. by modeling detection locations as a clustered point process, we extend recently developed methodology and propose a precise and computationally efficient estimator of animal density that does not require individual identification. we illustrate the method with an aerial survey of porpoise, on which cameras detect individuals at the surface of the sea, and we need to take account of the fact that they are not always at the surface."
estimation of population size when capture probability depends on individual states,abundance; closed population; individual heterogeneity; transition probabilities,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,WORTHINGTON H;MCCREA RS;KING R;GRIFFITHS RA,"we develop a multi-state model to estimate the size of a closed population from capture-recapture studies. we consider the case where capture-recapture data are not of a simple binary form, but where the state of an individual is also recorded upon every capture as a discrete variable. the proposed multi-state model can be regarded as a generalisation of the commonly applied set of closed population models to a multi-state form. the model allows for heterogeneity within the capture probabilities associated with each state while also permitting individuals to move between the different discrete states. a closed-form expression for the likelihood is presented in terms of a set of sufficient statistics. the link between existing models for capture heterogeneity is established, and simulation is used to show that the estimate of population size can be biased when movement between states is not accounted for. the proposed unconditional approach is also compared to a conditional approach to assess estimation bias. the model derived in this paper is motivated by a real ecological data set on great crested newts, triturus cristatus. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online."
the recent past and promising future for data integration methods to estimate species' distributions,data fusion; integrated distribution model; joint likelihood; spatial point process; species distribution modelling,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MILLER DAW;PACIFICI K;SANDERLIN JS;REICH BJ,"with the advance of methods for estimating species distribution models has come an interest in how to best combine datasets to improve estimates of species distributions. this has spurred the development of data integration methods that simultaneously harness information from multiple datasets while dealing with the specific strengths and weaknesses of each dataset. we outline the general principles that have guided data integration methods and review recent developments in the field. we then outline key areas that allow for a more general framework for integrating data and provide suggestions for improving sampling design and validation for integrated models. key to recent advances has been using point-process thinking to combine estimators developed for different data types. extending this framework to new data types will further improve our inferences, as well as relaxing assumptions about how parameters are jointly estimated. these along with the better use of information regarding sampling effort and spatial autocorrelation will further improve our inferences. recent developments form a strong foundation for implementation of data integration models. wider adoption can improve our inferences about species distributions and the dynamic processes that lead to distributional shifts."
caste-specific demography and phenology in bumblebees: modelling beewalk data,citizen science; mixture models; phenology; population trends; productivity; stopover models,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,MATECHOU E;FREEMAN SN;COMONT R,"we present novel dynamic mixture models for the monitoring of bumblebee populations on an unprecedented geographical scale, motivated by the uk citizen science scheme beewalk. the models allow us for the first time to estimate bumblebee phenology and within-season productivity, defined as the number of individuals in each caste per colony in the population in that year, from citizen science data. all of these parameters are estimated separately for each caste, giving a means of considerable ecological detail in examining temporal changes in the complex life cycle of a social insect in the wild. due to the dynamic nature of the models, we are able to produce population trends for a number of uk bumblebee species using the available time-series. via an additional simulation exercise, we show the extent to which useful information will increase if the survey continues, and expands in scale, as expected. bumblebees are extraordinarily important components of the ecosystem, providing pollination services of vast economic impact and functioning as indicator species for changes in climate or land use. our results demonstrate the changes in both phenology and productivity between years and provide an invaluable tool for monitoring bumblebee populations, many of which are in decline, in the uk and around the world. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online."
parameterizing the robust design in the bugs language: lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during growth on a long-lived bird,bayesian; branta bernicla nigricans; breeding probability; capture-mark-recapture; carry-over effects; fitness; population dynamics; robust design,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,RIECKE TV;LEACH AG;GIBSON D;SEDINGER JS,"since the initial development of the robust design, this capture-recapture model structure has been modified to estimate temporary emigration and expanded to include auxiliary information such as band recovery and live resight data using maximum likelihood approaches. these developments have allowed investigators to separately assess individual and group effects on true survival, site fidelity, and temporary emigration. additionally, recent advances in the bugs language have allowed researchers to develop increasingly complex, user-specified models in bayesian frameworks. the robust design has rarely been implemented in the bugs language, and previous attempts to parameterize the robust design in bugs exhibited strong bias in estimates of temporary emigration rates. given the limitations of current parameterizations of the robust design in bayesian frameworks, and our research objectives, we have developed a parameterization of the robust design in the bugs language that produces unbiased estimates of all model parameters. we use this novel model structure to examine lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during early life on annual breeding probabilities of pacific black brent branta bernicla nigricans breeding on the yukon-kuskokwim river delta in western alaska. we found that individuals that were more structurally developed as goslings bred at increased rates as adults (beta = 0.14, f = 0.94), with no effect on adult survival (beta = 0.01, f = 0.62). additionally, we provide evidence for long-term declines in apparent survival of breeding adult females at the population level (beta = -0.01, f = 0.90). this novel model structure can be easily expanded (gibson et al., in press) and has important implications for population modelling at broad scales, where we apply it to a declining population of pacific black brent. given long-term declines in gosling growth on the yukon-kuskokwim delta, we predict future declines in population trajectories as a result of lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during growth on adult fecundity and long-term declines in adult survival."
bayesian modeling of individual growth variability using back-calculation: application to pink cusk-eel (genypterus blacodes) off chile,individual variability; von bertalanffy model; student-t distribution; pink cusk-eel; chile,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,CONTRERAS REYES JE;QUINTERO FOL;WIFF R,"the von bertalanffy growth function (vbgf) with random effects has been widely used to estimate growth parameters incorporating individual variability of length-at-age. trajectories of individual growth can be inferred using either mark-recapture or back-calculation of length-at-age from growth marks in hard body parts such as otoliths. modem statistical methods evaluate individual variation usually from mark-recapture data, and the parameters describing this function are estimated using empirical bayes methods assuming gaussian error. in this paper, we combine recent studies in non-gaussian distributions and a bayesian approach to model growth variability using back-calculated data in harvested fish populations. we presumed that errors in the vbgf can be assumed as a student-t distribution, given the abundance of individuals with extreme length values. the proposed method was applied and compared to the standard methods using back-calculated length-at-age data for pink cusk-eel (genypterus blacodes) off chile. considering several information criteria, and comparing males and females, we have found that males grow significantly faster than females, and that length-at-age for both sexes exhibits extreme length observations. comparisons indicated that a student-t model with mixed effects describes best back-calculated data regarding pink cusk-eel. this framework merged the strengths of different approaches to estimate growth parameters in harvested fish populations, considering modeling of individual variability of length-at-age, bayesian inference, and distribution of errors from the student-t model."
estimating recruitment from capture-recapture data by modelling spatio-temporal variation in birth and age-specific survival rates,birth-death process; camera trapping; individual-based models; spatial capture-recapture; spatial demography; spatio-temporal point process; white-tailed deer,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CHANDLER RB;ENGEBRETSEN K;CHERRY MJ;GARRISON EP;MILLER KV,"1. understanding the factors influencing recruitment in animal populations is an important objective of many research and conservation programmes. however, evaluating hypotheses is challenging because recruitment is the outcome of birth and survival processes that are difficult to directly observe. capture-recapture is the most general framework for estimating recruitment in the presence of observation error, but existing methods ignore the underlying birth and survival processes, as well as age effects and spatial variation in vital rates. 2. we present an individual-based, spatio-temporal model that can be fit to capture-recapture data to draw inferences on the birth and survival processes governing recruitment dynamics. the number, dates, and spatial distribution of births are modelled as outcomes of a point process, and survival is modelled using a failure time approach. survival parameters can be modelled as functions of individuals traits and time-varying, spatial covariates. continuous-and discrete-time formulations are possible. we demonstrate the model using 7 months of camera data collected on white-tailed deer odocoileus virginianus fawns in big cypress national preserve. spot patterns were used to individually identify 28 fawns, detected 1,454 times between december 1, 2015 and july 1, 2016. 3. a total of 37 (95% ci: 30-49) fawns were born, of which 16 (95% ci: 10-23) survived 180 days to the recruitment age. mean parturition date was february 14 (95% ci: february 6-february 22), much earlier than in more temperate parts of the species' range, but coinciding with the dry season in southern florida. we found little evidence that mortality rates decreased with age, but the estimate of the age effect was imprecise. in contrast, we found strong evidence that encounter rates were age-specific and increased rapidly over the first month of life as fawns became more mobile. 4. our case study demonstrates the potential of this new model for advancing knowledge of spatial population dynamics by providing insights into the birth and juvenile survival processes that influence recruitment. because the model can be applied to data from noninvasive survey methods such as camera trapping, it is possible to apply it at broad spatial scales to understand how environmental variables and predator communities influence recruitment."
joining the incompatible: exploiting purposive lists for the sample-based estimation of species richness,difference estimator; probabilistic sampling; purposive survey; supporting list; simulation,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,CHIARUCCI A;DI BIASE RM;FATTORINI L;MARCHESELLI M;PISANI C,"the lists of species obtained by purposive sampling by field ecologists can be used to improve the sample-based estimation of species richness. a new estimator is here proposed as a modification of the difference estimator in which the species inclusion probabilities are estimated by means of the species frequencies from incidence data. if the species list used to support the estimation is complete the estimator guesses the true richness without error. in the case of incomplete lists, the estimator provides values invariably greater than the number of species detected by the combination of sample-based and purposive surveys. an asymptotically conservative estimator of the mean squared error is also provided. a simulation study based on two artificial communities is carried out in order to check the obvious increase in accuracy and precision with respect to the widely applied estimators based on the sole sample information. finally, the proposed estimator is adopted to estimate species richness in the maremma regional park, italy."
modelling sound attenuation in heterogeneous environments for improved bioacoustic sampling of wildlife populations,acoustic monitoring; bioacoustics; distance sampling; least-cost path models; sound attenuation; sound pressure audiogram; spatial capture-recapture; telemetry,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ROYLE JA,"1. acoustic sampling methods are becoming increasingly important in biological monitoring. sound attenuation is one of the most important dynamics affecting the utility of acoustic data as it directly affects the probability of detection of individuals by acoustic sensor arrays and especially the localization of acoustic signals necessary in telemetry studies. therefore, models of sound attenuation are necessary to make efficient use of acoustic data in ecological monitoring and assessment applications. models of attenuation in widespread use are based on euclidean distance between source and sensor, which is justified under spherical attenuation of sound waves in homogeneous environments. 2. in this paper, i develop a model of sound attenuation based on a non-euclidean cost-weighted distance metric which contains attenuation coefficients that characterize the attenuation of sound due to environmental heterogeneity in the vicinity of an acoustic sensor array. 3. i show that parameters of the proposed attenuation model can be estimated by maximum likelihood using experimental data from an array of fixed sources, thus allowing investigators who use bioacoustic methods to devise explicit models of sound attenuation in situ and apply them to localization of sources and density estimation. in addition, drawing on analogy with spatial capture-recapture models, i argue that parameters of the non-euclidean model of attenuation can be estimated when source locations are unknown. thus, the models can be applied to real field studies which require estimation of attenuation parameters or localization of signals. 4. models of heterogeneous sound attenuation allow more accurate descriptions of acoustic monitoring data, and therefore should produce more accurate estimates of ecological parameters of interest, including source locations, density, and movement trajectories. moreover, the ability to test specific hypotheses about the effects of habitat and landscape structure on sound attenuation can improve the design of acoustic monitoring arrays and lead to more efficient deployment of acoustic sensing technology."
a length-based mark-recapture model for estimating abundance and recruitment: removing bias due to size-selective capture gear,mark-recapture; growth; abundance; size selectivity; length-based model; bias,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,VAN POORTEN BT;TAYLOR N;O BRIEN D;WALTERS CJ,"we describe an unbiased length-based, age-structured mark-recapture (lamr) model for estimating length based abundance and recruitment of fish populations. many mark-recapture studies employ capture gear that is size-selective, leading to a larger and faster growing marked sub-population with a different capture probability than the unmarked sub-population, resulting in a basic violation of assumptions for many mark-recapture models. persistent differences in marked and unmarked individuals are estimated in our model using growth type group accounting. simulation-evaluation results indicate that the model produces largely unbiased estimates of recruitment and abundance across a range of sampling scenarios and population life-history types, and is robust to growth parameter misspecification. however, in older, slow growing populations, the model is prone to 'smearing' of recruitment estimates across early year-classes. the lamr model is applied to data from multiple wild populations of rainbow trout to estimate recruitment and abundance. overall, results indicate that the lamr model addresses shortcomings associated with using size-selective gear in mark-recapture studies to produce reliable estimates of recruitment and size-based abundance."
using partial aggregation in spatial capture recapture,partially aggregated binary model; spatial capture recapture; wolverines,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MILLERET C;DUPONT P;BROSETH H;KINDBERG J;ROYLE JA;BISCHOF R,"1. spatial capture-recapture (scr) models are commonly used for analysing data collected using noninvasive genetic sampling (ngs). opportunistic ngs often leads to detections that do not occur at discrete detector locations. therefore, spatial aggregation of individual detections into fixed detectors (e.g., centre of grid cells) is an option to increase computing speed of scr analyses. however, it may reduce precision and accuracy of parameter estimations. 2. using simulations, we explored the impact that spatial aggregation of detections has on a trade-off between computing time and parameter precision and bias, under a range of biological conditions. we used three different observation models: the commonly used poisson and bernoulli models, as well as a novel way to partially aggregate detections (partially aggregated binary model [pab]) to reduce the loss of information after aggregating binary detections. the pab model divides detectors into k subdetectors and models the frequency of subdetectors with more than one detection as a binomial response with a sample size of k. finally, we demonstrate the consequences of aggregation and the use of the pab model using ngs data from the monitoring of wolverine (gulo gulo) in norway. 3. spatial aggregation of detections, while reducing computation time, does indeed incur costs in terms of reduced precision and accuracy, especially for the parameters of the detection function. scr models estimated abundance with a low bias (< 10%) even at high degree of aggregation, but only for the poisson and pab models. overall, the cost of aggregation is mitigated when using the poisson and pab models. at the same level of aggregation, the pab observation model out-performs the bernoulli model in terms of accuracy of estimates, while offering the benefits of a binary observation model (less assumptions about the underlying ecological process) over the count-based model. 4. we recommend that detector spacing after aggregation does not exceed 1.5 times the scale-parameter of the detection function in order to limit bias. we recommend the use of the pab observation model when performing spatial aggregation of binary data as it can mitigate the cost of aggregation, compared to the bernoulli model."

spatial capture-mark-resight estimation of animal population density,capture-mark-resight model; density estimation; maximum likelihood; overdispersion; spatial mark-resight; spatially explicit capture-recapture,BIOMETRICS,EFFORD MG;HUNTER CM,"sightings of previously marked animals can extend a capture-recapture dataset without the added cost of capturing new animals for marking. combined marking and resighting methods are therefore an attractive option in animal population studies, and there exist various likelihood-based non-spatial models, and some spatial versions fitted by markov chain monte carlo sampling. as implemented to date, the focus has been on modeling sightings only, which requires that the spatial distribution of pre-marked animals is known. we develop a suite of likelihood-based spatial mark-resight models that either include the marking phase (capture-mark-resight models) or require a known distribution of marked animals (narrow-sense mark-resight). the new models sacrifice some information in the covariance structure of the counts of unmarked animals; estimation is by maximizing a pseudolikelihood with a simulation-based adjustment for overdispersion in the sightings of unmarked animals. simulations suggest that the resulting estimates of population density have low bias and adequate confidence interval coverage under typical sampling conditions. further work is needed to specify the conditions under which ignoring covariance results in unacceptable loss of precision, or to modify the pseudolikelihood to include that information. the methods are applied to a study of ship rats rattus rattus using live traps and video cameras in a new zealand forest, and to previously published data."

bayesian propagation of record linkage uncertainty into population size estimation of human rights violations,capture-recapture; counting casualties; data linkage; decomposable graphical model; duplicate detection; entity resolution; multiple-systems estimation; multiple record linkage,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,SADINLE M,"multiple-systems or capture-recapture estimation are common techniques for population size estimation, particularly in the quantitative study of human rights violations. these methods rely on multiple samples from the population, along with the information of which individuals appear in which samples. the goal of record linkage techniques is to identify unique individuals across samples based on the information collected on them. linkage decisions are subject to uncertainty when such information contains errors and missingness, and when different individuals have very similar characteristics. uncertainty in the linkage should be propagated into the stage of population size estimation. we propose an approach called linkage-averaging to propagate linkage uncertainty, as quantified by some bayesian record linkage methodologies, into a subsequent stage of population size estimation. linkage-averaging is a two-stage approach in which the results from the record linkage stage are fed into the population size estimation stage. we show that under some conditions the results of this approach correspond to those of a proper bayesian joint model for both record linkage and population size estimation. the two-stage nature of linkage-averaging allows us to combine different record linkage models with different capture-recapture models, which facilitates model exploration. we present a case study from the salvadoran civil war, where we are interested in estimating the total number of civilian killings using lists of witnesses' reports collected by different organizations. these lists contain duplicates, typographical and spelling errors, missingness, and other inaccuracies that lead to uncertainty in the linkage. we show how linkage-averaging can be used for transferring the uncertainty in the linkage of these lists into different models for population size estimation."
assessing the dynamics of natural populations by fitting individual-based models with approximate bayesian computation,approximate bayesian computation; individual-based models; metapopulation dynamics; multiple data sources; population dynamics,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SIREN J;LENS L;COUSSEAU L;OVASKAINEN O,"1. individual-based models (ibms) allow realistic and flexible modelling of ecological systems, but their parameterization with empirical data is statistically and computationally challenging. approximate bayesian computation (abc) has been proposed as an efficient approach for inference with ibms, but its applicability to data on natural populations has not been yet fully explored. 2. we construct an ibm for the metapopulation dynamics of a species inhabiting a fragmented patch network, and develop an abc method for parameterization of the model. we consider several scenarios of data availability from count data to combination of mark-recapture and genetic data. we analyse both simulated and real data on white-starred robin (pogonocichla stellata), a passerine bird living in montane forest environment in kenya, and assess how the amount and type of data affect the estimates of model parameters and indicators of population state. 3. the indicators of the population state could be reliably estimated using the abc method, but full parameterization was not achieved due to strong posterior correlations between model parameters. while the combination of the data types did not provide more accurate estimates for most of the indicators of population state or model parameters than the most informative data type (ringing data or genetic data) alone, the combined data allowed robust simultaneous estimation of all unknown quantities. 4. our results show that abc methods provide a powerful and flexible technique forparameterizing complex ibms with multiple data sources, and assessing the dynamics of the population in a robust manner."
markov-modulated poisson processes as a new framework for analysing capture-recapture data,capture-recapture; likelihood; markov-modulated poisson process; non-constant time interval; uncertainty,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CHOQUET R,"1. opportunistic capture-recapture data consists of observations over non-constant time intervals and so fails to satisfy the basic assumptions of traditional capture-recapture models. analysing opportunistic capture-recapture data is often done by discretizing time intervals or summarizing data, but without taking into account the continuous time process of the state and/or the capture. 2. to deal with non-constant time-intervals, continuous time closed capture-recapture models have been proposed by yip, huggins, and lin (1996), hwang and chao (2002), schofield, barker, and gelling (2017) for estimating population size. more recently, a continuous time cormack-jolly-seber model has been proposed by fouchet, santin-janin, sauvage, yoccoz, and pontier (2016) to reduce bias in survival rates, and a two-state process has been proposed by choquet, garnier, awuve, and besnard (2017) to estimate reproduction rates and survival rates of young within a season. 3. the aim of the current study is to demonstrate how an approach based on a markov-modulated poisson process (mmpp) (freed & shepp, 1982) allows, in a similar way to a multistate model, to model opportunistic data, using several states. to this end, several multistate models were rewritten as mmpp models, showing, the potential for this approach to address the ecological questions as multistate models, but using an extended data framework. in particular, it is a useful framework for dealing with data that has unordered levels of uncertainty. 4. the methods were illustrated using simulations and analysis of data on the alpine ibex (capra ibex)."
spatial capture-recapture with partial identity: an application to camera traps,spatial capture-recapture; partial identity; camera trapping; multiple marks,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,AUGUSTINE BC;ROYLE JA;KELLY MJ;SATTER CB;ALONSO RS;BOYDSTON EE;CROOKS KR,"camera trapping surveys frequently capture individuals whose identity is only known from a single flank. the most widely used methods for incorporating these partial identity individuals into density analyses discard some of the partial identity capture histories, reducing precision, and, while not previously recognized, introducing bias. here, we present the spatial partial identity model (spim), which uses the spatial location where partial identity samples are captured to probabilistically resolve their complete identities, allowing all partial identity samples to be used in the analysis. we show that the spim outperforms other analytical alternatives. we then apply the spim to an ocelot data set collected on a trapping array with double-camera stations and a bobcat data set collected on a trapping array with single-camera stations. the spim improves inference in both cases and, in the ocelot example, individual sex is determined from photographs used to further resolve partial identities-one of which is resolved to near certainty. the spim opens the door for the investigation of trapping designs that deviate from the standard two camera design, the combination of other data types between which identities cannot be deterministically linked, and can be extended to the problem of partial genotypes."
on the reliability of n-mixture models for count data,ancillary statistic; capture recapture; log linear model; n-mixture models; partial likelihood,BIOMETRICS,BARKER RJ;SCHOFIELD MR;LINK WA;SAUER JR,"n-mixture models describe count data replicated in time and across sites in terms of abundance n and detectability p. they are popular because they allow inference about n while controlling for factors that influence p without the need for marking animals. using a capture-recapture perspective, we show that the loss of information that results from not marking animals is critical, making reliable statistical modeling of n and p problematic using just count data. one cannot reliably fit a model in which the detection probabilities are distinct among repeat visits as this model is overspecified. this makes uncontrolled variation in p problematic. by counter example, we show that even if p is constant after adjusting for covariate effects (the constant p assumption) scientifically plausible alternative models in which n (or its expectation) is non-identifiable or does not even exist as a parameter, lead to data that are practically indistinguishable from data generated under an n-mixture model. this is particularly the case for sparse data as is commonly seen in applications. we conclude that under the constant p assumption reliable inference is only possible for relative abundance in the absence of questionable and/or untestable assumptions or with better quality data than seen in typical applications. relative abundance models for counts can be readily fitted using poisson regression in standard software such as r and are sufficiently flexible to allow controlling for p through the use covariates while simultaneously modeling variation in relative abundance. if users require estimates of absolute abundance, they should collect auxiliary data that help with estimation of p."
"simultaneous modelling of movement, measurement error, and observer dependence in mark-recapture distance sampling: an application to arctic bird surveys",aerial survey; double-observer; mark-recapture distance sampling; measurement error; movement; point independence,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,CONN PB;ALISAUSKAS RT,"mark-recapture distance sampling is a promising method for surveying bird populations from aircraft in open landscapes. however, commonly available distance sampling estimators require that distances to target animals are made without error and that animals are stationary while sampling is being conducted. motivated by a recent bird survey where these requirements were routinely violated, we describe a marginal likelihood framework for estimating abundance from double-observer data that can accommodate movement and measurement error when observations are made consecutively (as with front and rear observers), when animals are uniformly distributed during detection by the first observer, and when detections consist of both moving and stationary animals. assuming that all animals are subject to measurement error and that some animals can move between detections, we integrate over unknown animal locations to construct a marginal likelihood for detection, movement, and measurement error parameters. estimates of animal abundance are then obtained using a modified horvitz-thompson-like estimator. in addition, unmodelled heterogeneity in detection probability can be accommodated through observer dependence parameters. using simulation, we show that our approach yields low bias compared to approaches that ignore movement and/or measurement error, including in cases where there is considerable detection heterogeneity. applying our approach to data from a double-observer waterfowl helicopter survey in northern canada, we are able to estimate bird density accounting for movement and measurement error and corrected for observer heterogeneity. our approach appears promising for generating unbiased estimates of bird abundance necessary for reliable conservation and management."

a simplified mark-release-recapture protocol to improve the cost effectiveness of repeated population size quantification,bog fritillary butterfly; boloria aquilonaris; boloria eunomia; capture-mark-recapture; catch effort; cranberry fritillary butterfly; long-term monitoring; mark software; sampling efforts,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,TURLURE C;PE ER G;BAGUETTE M;SCHTICKZELLE N,"obtaining an accurate quantification of population size is often of prime importance in ecology and conservation biology (e.g. population viability analysis, a basic step for assessing species and population status in a given area and guiding effective conservation). when obtaining a reliable quantification of absolute (vs. relative) population size is required, mark-release-recapture (mrr) is a method of choice for many organisms. this is a highly reliable but costly procedure in terms of time and potential impact on species and sites. consequently, less costly alternatives are highly desirable for conservation and population ecologists. we present here a simplified mrr protocol to mitigate this cost of repeated mrr sampling with little compromise on the quality of the population size estimation. using one of the largest existing butterfly mrr databases, collected on two fritillary species over a period of 20years and >20 populations in belgium, we assessed the possibility to reduce the effort of collecting mrr data while keeping accurate quantification of total population size. by downsampling from the full datasets and calculating a range of demographic census metrics, we specifically investigated whether marking individuals is necessary, and whether the number of sampling sessions can be reduced. we found that (1) counting individuals is not enough: some individual marking, even in a simplistic way to differentiate newly recorded from previously seen individuals, is essential for estimating population size. (2) a simple linear conversion function (number of missed individuals for each marked one) can be used to compute population size from the number of individuals marked over a small number of mrr sampling sessions. (3) parameterizing this function is system specific, because it depends on detectability of individuals, but only requires an initial effort of traditional high-effort mrr in a few populations encompassing the expected range of population size, combined with previous knowledge on the species about potential factors affecting detectability. our simplified mrr protocol should allow scientists to obtain absolute population size estimates almost as good as with traditional high-effort mrr, but at a cost lowered in both the marking procedure and the intensity of field visits."
performance of multistate mark-recapture models for temporary emigration in the presence of survival costs,bias; power; simulation; survival; temporary emigration,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,HENLE K;GRUBER B,"temporary emigration is widespread in animals and plants and has important implications for ecological processes, evolution and the conservation of species. it is increasingly studied with capture-mark-recapture (cmr) models. temporary emigration provides particular challenges to cmr analyses if it involves movement to an unobservable state. a multistate model in which individuals may move between an observable and an unobservable state (called te model) was developed for such cases. the model assumes equal survival probability in both states. this assumption may be violated, especially if temporary emigration involves trade-offs between survival and reproduction. a comprehensive assessment of the effects of unequal survival probability on power to detect temporary emigration and on bias and precision of estimates is still needed to understand the applicability and limits of the model. we assessed power to detect temporary emigration for four goodness-of-fit tests and evaluated bias and precision of estimates for the te model and for its combination with a robust design. our simulation study, based on 16,650 parameter combinations, shows that temporary emigration is more challenging than currently usually acknowledged. the tests 2.ct and 2.c are largely independent of the difference in survival probability between the states. in contrast, test 3.sr is sensitive to the difference in survival probability but also to emigration probability. tests 2.c and 2.ct have high power if a large part of the population temporarily emigrates and a large fraction of the individuals return on the next capture occasion. under this condition, bias is low and precision adequate even if the assumption of equal survival probability is violated. bias and precision are also satisfactory if the assumption is met but unsatisfactory or unreliable for the remaining parameter space. we conclude that the uncertainties whether an appropriate model was selected and whether the estimates from the selected model may be biased should be clearly communicated and that every endeavour should be made to make the unobservable state observable."
a generalized chao estimator with measurement error and external information,chao estimator; external information; simex,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,DOTTO F;FARCOMENI A,"we present a generalized chao (gc) estimator based on a subject-occasion-specific design matrix. we then extend the gc estimator to (i) external information, in the form of non-linear constraints on subpopulation sizes and (ii) measurement error. for the first, we propose a reparameterization of the estimating equations. as a result, the constrained mle can be found with no additional computational efforts. for the second we generalize simex procedure to multiple measurement methods. in simulation we show that (even incorrect) external information can substantially decrease the mse. we illustrate with an application to a whale shark (rhincodon typus) population, where mostly jouvenile males are observed. we use external information on gender ratio of whale sharks to correct for low catchability of females, and our multivariate simex procedure to correct for measurement error in assessment of shark length. the resulting population size estimates are about 60% larger than the unconstrained-uncorrected counterparts."
a test of positive association for detecting heterogeneity in capture for capture-recapture data,cormack-jolly-seber model; goodman-kruskal's gamma; goodness-of-fit,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,JEYAM A;MCCREA RS;BREGNBALLE T;FREDERIKSEN M;PRADEL R,"the cormack-jolly-seber (cjs) model assumes that all marked animals have equal recapture probabilities at each sampling occasion, but heterogeneity in capture often occurs and should be taken into account to avoid biases in parameter estimates. although diagnostic tests are generally used to detect trap-dependence or transience and assess the overall fit of the model, heterogeneity in capture is not routinely tested for. in order to detect and identify this phenomenon in a cjs framework, we propose a test of positive association between previous and future encounters using goodman-kruskal's gamma. this test is based solely on the raw capture histories and makes no assumption on model structure. the development of the test is motivated by a dataset of sandwich terns (thalasseus sandvicensis), and we use the test to formally show that they exhibit heterogeneity in capture. we use simulation to assess the performance of the test in the detection of heterogeneity in capture, compared to existing and corrected diagnostic goodness-of-fit tests, leslie's test of equal catchability and carothers' extension of the leslie test. the test of positive association is easy to use and produces good results, demonstrating high power to detect heterogeneity in capture. we recommend using this new test prior to model fitting as the outcome will guide the model-building process and help draw more accurate biological conclusions. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online."
accounting for uncertainty in duplicate identification and group size judgements in mark-recapture distance sampling,abundance; coefficient of variation; common dolphins; double-observer aerial surveys; group size; mark-recapture distance sampling,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,HAMILTON ONP;KINCAID SE;CONSTANTINE R;KOZMIAN LEDWARD L;WALKER CG;FEWSTER RM,"1. mark-recapture distance sampling (mrds) surveys with two independent observers are widely used to estimate wildlife population abundance. the analysis relies on accurate identification of duplicate sightings common to both observers, and correct judgements of group size, both of which are hard to achieve for species that exhibit complex grouping patterns. 2. in this paper, we examine the impact of these sources of uncertainty on bias and precision of abundance estimates, using a case study of 22 aerial surveys of common dolphins (delphinus delphis) in the hauraki gulf, new zealand. we develop a novel probabilistic method to identify duplicate observations, and account for various sources of uncertainty using a simulation-intensive approach. 3. for our case study, identifying duplicates using reasonable but arbitrary thresholds of time and angle discrepancies created a range of abundance estimates differing by up to 20%, whereas our novel threshold-free probabilistic analysis returned an estimate roughly central to this range. uncertainty in group size made a smaller impact of up to 5% on abundance estimates. all analysis choices returned similar values for the coefficient of variation, from 20 to 23%. 4. generating robust estimates of abundance, and accounting for all associated sources of uncertainty, is critical for informing conservation management. our novel approach provides a way to eliminate arbitrary decisions associated with mrds, and account for a wider range of uncertainties. our method allows for the reliable application of mrds to a wider range of terrestrial and marine species, and will be a useful tool for producing robust abundance estimates for species that exhibit complex grouping patterns."

hidden markov models for extended batch data,batch marking; integrated population modeling; mark-recapture; open n-mixture models; viterbi algorithm; weather-loach,BIOMETRICS,COWEN LLE;BESBEAS P;MORGAN BJT;SCHWARZ CJ,"batch marking provides an important and efficient way to estimate the survival probabilities and population sizes of wild animals. it is particularly useful when dealing with animals that are difficult to mark individually. for the first time, we provide the likelihood for extended batch-marking experiments. it is often the case that samples contain individuals that remain unmarked, due to time and other constraints, and this information has not previously been analyzed. we provide ways of modeling such information, including an open n-mixture approach. we demonstrate that models for both marked and unmarked individuals are hidden markov models; this provides a unified approach, and is the key to developing methods for fast likelihood computation and maximization. likelihoods for marked and unmarked individuals can easily be combined using integrated population modeling. this allows the simultaneous estimation of population size and immigration, in addition to survival, as well as efficient estimation of standard errors and methods of model selection and evaluation, using standard likelihood techniques. alternative methods for estimating population size are presented and compared. an illustration is provided by a weather-loach data set, previously analyzed by means of a complex procedure of constructing a pseudo likelihood, the formation of estimating equations, the use of sandwich estimates of variance, and piecemeal estimation of population size. simulation provides general validation of the hidden markov model methods developed and demonstrates their excellent performance and efficiency. this is especially notable due to the large numbers of hidden states that may be typically required"
the 2012 census of agriculture: a capture-recapture analysis,NA,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,YOUNG LJ;LAMAS AC;ABREU DA,"the census of agriculture is conducted every 5 years, in years ending in 2 and 7. the census list frame is incomplete, resulting in undercoverage. not all operations on the list frame respond, and, based on the response, some misclassification occurs. in 2012, a capture-recapture analysis was conducted to adjust for undercoverage, nonresponse, and misclassification. this was the first time capture-recapture methods were used to produce official statistics for an establishment survey. the number of records on the census mailing list that were classified as farms was 1,382,099, and the published estimate of the number of farms was 2,109,303, a 34.5% adjustment. the adjustment was greatest for farms with low production levels and for specialty farms, both of which are difficult to identify and add to the list. the methods used are described. challenges that arose in the implementation process are discussed. areas for enhancement being targeted for the 2017 census of agriculture are highlighted. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online."
applying the multistate capture-recapture robust design to characterize metapopulation structure,distribution; heterogeneity; local transitions; mark-recapture; spatial scales; subpopulations; wildlife conservation,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CHABANNE DBH;POLLOCK KH;FINN H;BEJDER L,"1. population structure must be considered when developing mark-recapture (mr) study designs as the sampling of individuals from multiple populations (or subpopulations) may increase heterogeneity in individual capture probability. conversely, the use of an appropriate mr study design which accommodates heterogeneity associated with capture occasion varying covariates due to animals moving between 'states' (i.e. geographic sites) can provide insight into how animals are distributed in a particular environment and the status and connectivity of subpopulations. 2. the multistate closed robust design (mscrd) was chosen to investigate: (i) the demographic parameters of indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin (tursiops aduncus) subpopulations in coastal and estuarine waters of perth, western australia; and (ii) how they are related to each other in a metapopulation. using 4 years of year-round photo-identification surveys across three geographic sites, we accounted for heterogeneity of capture probability based on how individuals distributed themselves across geographic sites and characterized the status of subpopulations based on their abundance, survival and interconnection. 3. mscrd models highlighted high heterogeneity in capture probabilities and demographic parameters between sites. high capture probabilities, high survival and constant abundances described a subpopulation with high fidelity in an estuary. in contrast, low captures, permanent and temporary emigration and fluctuating abundances suggested transient use and low fidelity in an open coastline site. 4. estimates of transition probabilities also varied between sites, with estuarine dolphins visiting sheltered coastal embayments more regularly than coastal dolphins visited the estuary, highlighting some dynamics within the metapopulation. 5. synthesis and applications. to date, bottlenose dolphin studies using mark-recapture approach have focussed on investigating single subpopulations. here, in a heterogeneous coastal-estuarine environment, we demonstrated that spatially structured bottlenose dolphin subpopulations contained distinct suites of individuals and differed in size, demographics and connectivity. such insights into the dynamics of a metapopulation can assist in local-scale species conservation. the mscrd approach is applicable to species/populations consisting of recognizable individuals and is particularly useful for characterizing wildlife subpopulations that vary in their vulnerability to human activities, climate change or invasive species."
transient state estimation using continuous-time processes applied to opportunistic capture-recapture data,breeding; continuous modeling; markov model; opportunistic data; survival,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,CHOQUET R;GARNIER A;AWUVE E;BESNARD A,"typically, analyze of capture-recapture data rely on standard protocols of individual detection. encounters and reencounters of marked individuals are made during short sessions separated by constant time intervals. very often, it can be reasonably assumed that the time between two sessions is the same for all individuals. however, in some studies, data is collected opportunistically within a season. this is often due to difficulties concerning fieldwork and/or a lack of people involved in data collection. it can also be intentionally chosen, for example, if collecting data within a season provides additional information on the status of the individual (e.g. whether it is a breeder or a non-breeder). when using capture-recapture data, opportunistic data has typically been analyzed by using discretize time intervals, to avoid taking into account the continuous-time processes of state and capture. in this study, we modeled the transition between a transient state (non-breeder) to one absorbing state (breeder) in a continuous process over time. a poisson point process was used to model the capture data, allowing us to directly model the opportunistic data set. the main advantage of this new approach is that it allows a full use of opportunistic data - i.e. all available information can be used. as an illustrative working example, we applied the approach to investigate alpine ibex (capra ibex) reproduction over one year. we jointly estimated the following parameters: the breeding rate in the summer and the survival rate of the young from birth to the following spring. our findings suggest that this modeling approach has the potential to open new perspectives in population ecology.

using optimal transport theory to estimate transition probabilities in metapopulation dynamics,lagrangian; optimal transport; population dynamics; transition probabilities; movement ecology; cost-energy function,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,NICHOLS JM;SPENDELOW JA;NICHOLS JD,"this work considers the estimation of transition probabilities associated with populations moving among multiple spatial locations based on numbers of individuals at each location at two points in time. the problem is generally underdetermined as there exists an extremely large number of ways in which individuals can move from one set of locations to another. a unique solution therefore requires a constraint. the theory of optimal transport provides such a constraint in the form of a cost function, to be minimized in expectation over the space of possible transition matrices. we demonstrate the optimal transport approach on marked bird data and compare to the probabilities obtained via maximum likelihood estimation based on marked individuals. it is shown that by choosing the squared euclidean distance as the cost, the estimated transition probabilities compare favorably to those obtained via maximum likelihood with marked individuals. other implications of this cost are discussed, including the ability to accurately interpolate the population's spatial distribution at unobserved points in time and the more general relationship between the cost and minimum transport energy.

a general approach to model movement in (highly) fragmented patch networks,metapopulation; patch transition; spatial configuration; landscape connectivity; memory,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,MORALES JM;DI VIRGILIO A;DELGADO MD;OVASKAINEN O,"landscape heterogeneity can often be represented as a series of discrete habitat or resource patches surrounded by a matrix of non-habitat. understanding how animals move in such networks of patches is important for many theoretical and applied questions. the probability of going from one patch to another is affected in a non-trivial way by the characteristics and location of other patches in the network. nearby patches can compete as possible destinations, and a particular patch can be shadowed by neighboring patches. we present a way to account for the effects of the spatial configuration of patches in models of space use where individuals alternate between spending time in a patch and moving to other patches in the network. the approach is based on the original derivation of ovaskainen and cornell (j appl probab 40:557-580, 2003) for a diffusion model that considered all possible ways in which an individual leaving a particular patch can eventually reach another patch before dying or leaving the patch network. by replacing the theoretical results of ovaskainen and cornell by other appropriate functions, we provide generality and thus make their approach useful in contexts where diffusion is not a good approximation of movement. furthermore, we provide ways to estimate time spent in the non-habitat matrix when going from patch to patch and implement a method to incorporate the effect of the history of previous visits on future patch use. we present an mcmc way to fit these models to data and illustrate the approach with both simulated data and data from sheep moving among seasonally flooded meadows in northern patagonia.supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online."

accounting for false mortality in telemetry tag applications,murray cod; trout cod; golden perch; capture-recapture; telemetry; tag failure,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,BIRD T;LYON J;WOTHERSPOON S;KING R;MCCARTHY M,"deaths of animals in the wild are rarely observed directly, which often limits understanding of survival rates. telemetry transmitters offer field ecologists the opportunity to observe mortality events in cases as the absence of animal movement. when observations of mortality are based on factors such as the absence of animal movement, live individuals can be mistaken for dead, resulting in biased estimates of survival. additionally, tag failure or emigration might also influence estimates of survival in telemetry studies. failing to account for mis-classification, tag failure, and emigration rates can result in overestimates of mortality rates by up two-fold, even when the data are corrected for obviously mistaken entries. we use a multi-state capture-recapture model with a misclassification parameter in estimating both the rate of permanent emigration and/or tag failure and the rate at which individuals are mistakenly identified as dead. we use this method on an annual telemetry survey of three species of native fish in the murray river, australia: murray cod (maccullochella peelii), trout cod (maccullochella macquariensis) and golden perch (macquaria ambigua). evidence for higher mortality rates in the first year post-implantation occurred for murray cod and golden perch, which is likely an effect of tagging and/or the transmitter, or transmitters shedding. using simulations, we confirm that our model approach is robust to a broad range of misclassification and transmitter failure rates. with these simulations we also demonstrate that misclassification models that do not account for emigration will likely be erroneous if live and dead animals have different probabilities of detection. these findings will have a broad interest to ecologists wishing to account for multiple sources of misclassification error in capture-mark-recapture studies, with the caveat that the specifics of the approach are dependent on species, transmitter types and other aspects of experimental design which may or may not be amenable to the misclassification framework.

graphical diagnostics for occupancy models with imperfect detection,dunn-smyth residuals; goodness-of-fit; imperfect detection; probability integral transforms,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,WARTON DI;STOKLOSA J;GUILLERA ARROITA G;MACKENZIE DI;WELSH AH,"occupancy-detection models that account for imperfect detection have become widely used in many areas of ecology. as with any modelling exercise, it is important to assess whether the fitted model encapsulates the main sources of variation in the data, yet there have been few methods developed for occupancy-detection models that would allow practitioners to do so. in this paper, a new type of residual for occupancy-detection models is developed according to the method of dunn & smyth (journal of computational and graphical statistics, 5, 1996, 236-244). residuals are separately constructed to diagnose the occupancy and detection components of the model. because the residuals are quite noisy, we suggest fitting a smoother through plots of residuals against predictors of fitted values, with 95% confidence bands, to diagnose lack-of-fit. the method is illustrated using swiss squirrel data, and evaluated using simulations based on that dataset. plotting residuals against predictors or against fitted values performed reasonably well as methods for diagnosing violations of occupancy-detection model assumptions, particularly plots of residuals against a missing predictor. relatively high false positive rates were sometimes observed, but this seems to be controlled reasonably well by fitting smoothers to these plots and being guided in interpretation by 95% confidence bands around the smoothers."
modelling individual migration patterns using a bayesian nonparametric approach for capture-recapture data,chinese restaurant process; great crested newts; poisson-gamma process; reed warblers; shot-noise cox process; stopover data,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,MATECHOU E;CARON F,"we present a bayesian nonparametric approach for modelling wildlife migration patterns using capture-recapture (cr) data. arrival times of individuals are modelled in continuous time and assumed to be drawn from a poisson process with unknown intensity function, which is modelled via a flexible nonparametric mixture model. the proposed cr framework allows us to estimate the following: (i) the total number of individuals that arrived at the site, (ii) their times of arrival and departure, and hence their stopover duration, and (iii) the density of arrival times, providing a smooth representation of the arrival pattern of the individuals at the site. we apply the model to data on breeding great crested newts (triturus cristatus) and on migrating reed warblers (acrocephalus scirpaceus). for the former, the results demonstrate the staggered arrival of individuals at the breeding ponds and suggest that males tend to arrive earlier than females. for the latter, they demonstrate the arrival of migrating flocks at the stopover site and highlight the considerable difference in stopover duration between caught and not-caught individuals."
"petersen estimator, chapman adjustment, list effects, and heterogeneity",bias correction; capture-recapture; nonidentifiability,BIOMETRICS,MAO CX;HUANG RC;ZHANG SJ,we use a nonparametric mixture model for the purpose of estimating the size of a population from multiple lists in which both the individual effects and list effects are allowed to vary. we propose a lower bound of the population size that admits an analytic expression. the lower bound can be estimated without the necessity of model-fitting. the asymptotical normality of the estimator is established. both the estimator itself and that for the estimable bound of its variance are adjusted. these adjusted versions are shown to be unbiased in the limit. simulation experiments are performed to assess the proposed approach and real applications are studied.
the integration of mark re-encounter and tracking data to quantify migratory connectivity,integrated model; multi-state model; mark-recapture data; gps tracking; geolocation; data analysis; bayesian methods,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,KORNER NIEVERGELT F;PREVOT C;HAHN S;JENNI L;LIECHTI F,"animals which spend subsequent seasons in different areas connect geographical regions. the connection between breeding and non-breeding grounds is defined as migratory connectivity. the quantification of such connectivity is important, because movements between different locations can have strong consequences for the moving animal as well as the encountered habitats or ecosystems. connectivity is usually investigated either on the basis of (few unsystematic) re-encounters of (often large numbers of) marked individuals or by observations of a few individuals tracked by remote sensing techniques, i.e. gps or geolocation. the combination of qualitatively different data sets can reduce the limitations of each type of data and thus improve the accuracy of the estimated connectivity parameters considerably. we formally combine individual tracking data and mark re-encounter data in a probabilistic model framework for quantifying connectivity. in a first example, we quantify migratory connectivity of a long-distance passerine migrant based on ring re-encounter and geolocator data. as a second example, we combine re-encounter data of ear-tagged wild boars with gps tracking data to estimate the spatial distribution of wild boars during the hunting and the non-hunting seasons. these two examples illustrate the use of the model in two different framework: 1) long-distance migration and, 2) seasonal (e.g. hunting induced) non-migratory movements. results from the integrated analyses provided more information than the informal comparison of the results from independent analyses on each data set separately. parameter estimates were more precise in the integrated analyses compared to the separate analyses and stronger conclusions could be drawn. the integration of mark re-encounter and tracking data reduces sampling bias and increases the value of both data sets but the weighting of each data set needs further investigation.

estimation in closed capture-recapture models when covariates are missing at random,inverse probability weighting; missing at random; multiple imputation; population size estimation; regression calibration,BIOMETRICS,LEE SM;HWANG WH;TAPSOBA JD,"individual covariates are commonly used in capture-recapture models as they can provide important information for population size estimation. however, in practice, one or more covariates may be missing at random for some individuals, which can lead to unreliable inference if records with missing data are treated as missing completely at random. we show that, in general, such a naive complete-case analysis in closed capture-recapture models with some covariates missing at random underestimates the population size. we develop methods for estimating regression parameters and population size using regression calibration, inverse probability weighting, and multiple imputation without any distributional assumptions about the covariates. we show that the inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation approaches are asymptotically equivalent. we present a simulation study to investigate the effects of missing covariates and to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. we also illustrate an analysis using data on the bird species yellow-bellied prinia collected in hong kong."

estimating abundance: a non parametric mark recapture approach for open and closed systems,abundance; capture-recapture; cluster sampling; heterogeneity; non-parametric; population estimation,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,REHMAN Z;TOMS CN;FINCH C,"we present a novel, non-parametric, frequentist approach for capture-recapture data based on a ratio estimator, which offers several advantages. first, as a non-parametric model, it does not require a known underlying distribution for parameters nor the associated assumptions, eliminating the need for post-hoc corrections or additional modeling to account for heterogeneity and other violated assumptions. second, the model explicitly deals with dependence of trials by considering trials to be dependent; therefore, cluster sampling is handled naturally and additional adjustments are not necessary. third, it accounts for ordering, utilizing the fact that a system with a small population will have a greater frequency of recaptures ""early"" in the survey work compared to an identical system with a larger population. we provide mathematical proof that our estimator attains asymptotic minimum variance under open systems. we apply the model to a data set of bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) and compare results to those from classic closed models. we show that the model has an impressive rate of convergence and demonstrate that there's an inverse relationship between population size and the proportion of the population that need to be sampled, while achieving the same degree of accuracy for abundance estimates. the model is flexible and can apply to ecological situations as well as other situations that lend themselves to capture recapture sampling."

open models for removal data,common lizard; depletion; great crested newts; rjmcmc; stopover model,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,MATECHOU E;MCCREA RS;MORGAN BJT;NASH DJ;GRIFFITHS RA,"individuals of protected species, such as amphibians and reptiles, often need to be removed from sites before development commences. usually, the population is considered to be closed. all individuals are assumed to (i) be present and available for detection at the start of the study period and (ii) remain at the site until the end of the study, unless they are detected. however, the assumption of population closure is not always valid. we present new removal models which allow for population renewal through birth and/or immigration, and population depletion through sampling as well as through death/emigration. when appropriate, productivity may be estimated and a bayesian approach allows the estimation of the probability of total population depletion. we demonstrate the performance of the models using data on common lizards, zootoca vivipara, and great crested newts, triturus cristatus."
intrinsic heterogeneity in detection probability and its effect on n-mixture models,abundance-estimation; behaviour; density dependence; detection probability; model testing; monitoring; negative binomial; poisson; population survey; zero-inflated poisson,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,VEECH JA;OTT JR;TROY JR,"estimating the abundance or density of animal populations is often a fundamental task in ecological research and species conservation. n-mixture models are widely used to estimate the detection probability of individual organisms that thusly leads to more accurate estimates of a species' true abundance. however, individuals likely vary in their probabilities of being detected. during a survey, heterogeneity (variation) in individual detection probability might arise due to conditions of the surveying process; this form of extrinsic heterogeneity can be accounted for by the use of appropriate covariates in the models. in contrast, intrinsic heterogeneity in the detection probabilities of individuals arises when intraspecific variation in behaviour results in individual organisms differing in their latent (inherent) probabilities of being detected. this form of heterogeneity is not tractable by the use of covariates and its possible effects on model performance have not been investigated to date. using simulated data, we evaluated the performance of poisson, negative binomial and zero-inflated poisson versions of n-mixture models under the conditions of intrinsic heterogeneity in individual detection probability. most versions of n-mixture models performed well in estimating abundance as indicated by relatively low root-mean-square-error values (rmse<1). error distributions indicated a lack of substantial bias and relatively high precision and accuracy when simulated detection probabilities of individuals were high (>05) and heterogeneity was random. otherwise, with structured heterogeneity (particularly positive density dependence) and low detection probabilities (<05), model performance was reduced (rmse>2). the poorest performing model was the zero-inflated poisson version of n-mixture model applied to data from low survey effort. our results suggest that n-mixture models are robust to intrinsic heterogeneity in individual detection probabilities except when the detection probabilities are low. when model-estimated detection probabilities are low (<05), model users should be aware that estimates of abundance could be erroneous if there was non-random intrinsic heterogeneity in individual detection probabilities during the surveys. remedying this situation might require redesigning the basic survey protocol such that it does not rely on behavioural traits (as cues to detection) that are intrinsically variable among individuals."
a flexible ratio regression approach for zero-truncated capture-recapture counts,capture-recapture; mixed binomial distributions; ratio regression estimator; zero-truncated model,BIOMETRICS,BOHNING D;ROCCHETTI I;ALFO M;HOLLING H,"capture-recapture methods are used to estimate the size of a population of interest which is only partially observed. in such studies, each member of the population carries a count of the number of times it has been identified during the observational period. in real-life applications, only positive counts are recorded, and we get a truncated at zero-observed distribution. we need to use the truncated count distribution to estimate the number of unobserved units. we consider ratios of neighboring count probabilities, estimated by ratios of observed frequencies, regardless of whether we have a zero-truncated or an untruncated distribution. rocchetti et al. (2011) have shown that, for densities in the katz family, these ratios can be modeled by a regression approach, and rocchetti et al. (2014) have specialized the approach to the beta-binomial distribution. once the regression model has been estimated, the unobserved frequency of zero counts can be simply derived. the guiding principle is that it is often easier to find an appropriate regression model than a proper model for the count distribution. however, a full analysis of the connection between the regression model and the associated count distribution has been missing. in this manuscript, we fill the gap and show that the regression model approach leads, under general conditions, to a valid count distribution; we also consider a wider class of regression models, based on fractional polynomials. the proposed approach is illustrated by analyzing various empirical applications, and by means of a simulation study."
modelling temporal and spatial variability in tag reporting-rates for newfoundland cod (gadus morhua),cod; mark-recapture; tag reporting-rate; tagging; tmb,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,KONRAD C;BRATTEY J;CADIGAN NG,"mark-recapture experiments can be used to estimate the exploitation rate of a fishery; however, the estimate is influenced by the tag reporting-rate by the fishers. we present two methods to estimate the reporting rates in high/low reward ($100 and $10 cad respectively) long-term cod tagging experiments. we fit two binomial logistic mixed-effect models, one with temporal auto-correlation in the reporting-rate year-effects and one with independent year-effects. we estimate reporting-rates separately for recreational and commercial fishers, and test for spatial variation using fixed-effects for spatial regions. due to the complexity of the fishery, our models account for factors such as recapture-fishery type, fish-size and time-at-liberty. our results indicate that the recreational fishers reporting-rate was constant at 0.51 across all regions and years. the commercial fishery showed more spatial and temporal variation, with the reporting-rates estimates lying between 0.67 and 0.87 for the independent year-effect model, and between 0.57 and 0.84 for the random walk model. furthermore, we assessed the model performance as well as the coverage probability of nominal 95 % confidence intervals using simulations. we found that the models performed adequately; however, the nominal 95 % confidence intervals tended to be too narrow."

hierarchical models for describing space-for-time variations in insect population size and sex-ratio along a primary succession,animal abundance; carabids; cold-adapted species; detection probability; removal sampling; sex-ratio,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,TENAN S;MAFFIOLETTI C;CACCIANIGA M;COMPOSTELLA C;SEPPI R;GOBBI M,"chronosequences of glacier retreat are useful for investigating primary successions over time periods that are longer than direct observation would permit. in this context, space-for-time substitution studies have been applied to assess the effects of climate change on invertebrate assemblages. however, population dynamics of insect species following retreating glaciers has been under-investigated until now due to difficulty in applying capture-recapture methods and correctly identifying species in the field. removal sampling methods are commonly used, but imperfect detectability is rarely accounted for in the analytical framework. in this paper we study the effects of environmental drivers of spatial, and indirectly temporal, variation in population size and sex-ratio of cold-adapted insects through a hierarchical framework for abundance. we show the importance of a metapopulation design, where samples are replicated in space and time, to model data from small and scattered populations, typically present in habitats with climate mediated selective pressure like those along glacier forelands. this scattered distribution can influence the observation or sampling process and thus species detectability. our results show that glacier retreat differently affects species-specific changes of population size and sex ratio along the chronosequence, even if the species are taxonomically related. small-sized populations occur on the glacier surface, near the glacier front, and in sites deglaciated for at least 100 yrs. on the contrary, larger populations occupy sites deglaciated for more than 20 yrs, but less than 100 yrs. this pattern is described by the concave relationship of abundance with both species richness of other arthropods (proxy of habitat complexity) and soil organic matter (proxy of soil maturity). sex-ratio showed opposite patterns in relation to time since deglaciation. hierarchical models that estimate abundance of spatially distinct subpopulations represent useful tools for accurately assessing changes in species abundance following climate change while accounting for possible bias associated with imperfect detectability, an issue which is often neglected in space-for-time substitution studies on invertebrates and, more generally, in studies involving pitfall trapping.

semi-markov arnason-schwarz models,capture-recapture-recovery; dwell-time distribution; hidden markov model; multi-state model,BIOMETRICS,KING R;LANGROCK R,"we consider multi-state capture-recapture-recovery data where observed individuals are recorded in a set of possible discrete states. traditionally, the arnason-schwarz model has been fitted to such data where the state process is modeled as a first-order markov chain, though second-order models have also been proposed and fitted to data. however, low-order markov models may not accurately represent the underlying biology. for example, specifying a (time-independent) first-order markov process involves the assumption that the dwell time in each state (i.e., the duration of a stay in a given state) has a geometric distribution, and hence that the modal dwell time is one. specifying time-dependent or higher-order processes provides additional flexibility, but at the expense of a potentially significant number of additional model parameters. we extend the arnason-schwarz model by specifying a semi-markov model for the state process, where the dwell-time distribution is specified more generally, using, for example, a shifted poisson or negative binomial distribution. a state expansion technique is applied in order to represent the resulting semi-markov arnason-schwarz model in terms of a simpler and computationally tractable hidden markov model. semi-markov arnason-schwarz models come with only a very modest increase in the number of parameters, yet permit a significantly more flexible state process. model selection can be performed using standard procedures, and in particular via the use of information criteria. the semi-markov approach allows for important biological inference to be drawn on the underlying state process, for example, on the times spent in the different states. the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in a simulation study, before being applied to real data corresponding to house finches where the states correspond to the presence or absence of conjunctivitis."
an r package for analysing survival using continuous-time open capture-recapture models,estimation bias; frequentist inference; inhomogeneous poisson process; maximum likelihood estimation; survival analysis model,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,FOUCHET D;SANTIN JANIN H;SAUVAGE F;YOCCOZ NG;PONTIER D,"1. capture-recapture software packages have proven to be very powerful tools for analysing factors affecting survival in wild populations. however, all such packages are limited to discrete-time protocols. appropriate survival analysis tools are still lacking for data acquired from continuous-time protocols. 2. we have developed a statistical method and propose an r package for analysing such data based on an extension of classical survival analysis models incorporating an inhomogeneous poisson process for modelling capture histories. first, data were simulated from a continuous-time protocol. these data were used to (i) compare survival estimation biases of discrete-and continuous-time approaches and (ii) investigate the performance and accuracy of our r package for four types of covariates: factors varying between individuals (like sex), in time (like climatic factors), both in time and between individuals (like physical condition) and age (as a categorical factor). secondly, the r package has been applied to a real data set for survival analysis of cats in the kerguelen archipelago (regrouping 682 cats over 20 years) as an illustrative example. 3. results of the simulated data analysis show that the method performs better than its discrete-time counterpart for analysing data acquired from continuous-time protocols. it provides unbiased parameter estimates for all parameters except those that vary both in time and between individuals - which is not surprising, since in our case, these factors were not updated in continuous time (i.e. only upon capture). when applied to the kerguelen cat data set, the results suggest that survival is lower in juveniles than in adults and subadults, varies between study sites and increases with physical condition, and this latter effect being more important in females than in males. sex, season, temporal linear trend in survival and the ndvi vegetation index were also tested but were not found to be significant. however, confidence intervals were too large (due to a low recapture rate) for excluding such effects. further analyses are still needed for rigorous covariate testing in this context. 4. in conclusion, continuous-time approaches - such as that presented in this paper - should be preferred when data acquired from continuous-time protocols is analysed."
the measurement of selection when detection is imperfect: how good are naive methods?,capture-mark-recapture; directional selection; mark; natural selection; selection gradients; simulation; stabilizing selection,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,WALLER J;SVENSSON EI,"1. the life spans of animals can be measured in natural populations by uniquely marking individuals and then releasing them into the field. selection on survival (a component of fitness) can subsequently be quantified by regressing the life spans of these marked individuals on their trait values. however, marked individuals are not always seen on every subsequent catching occasion, and for this reason, imperfect detection is considered a problem when estimating survival selection in natural populations. 2. capture-mark-recapture methods have been advocated as a powerful means to correct for imperfect detection. here, we use simulated and field data sets to evaluate the effect of assuming perfect detection ('naive methods'), when detection is really imperfect. we compared the performance of the naive methods with methods correcting for imperfect detection (mark-recapture methods, or mr). 3. although the effects of trait-dependent recapture probability are mitigated when recapture probability is high, mark-recapture methods still provide the safest choice when recapture probability might be trait-dependent. in our simulations, mark-recapture methods had a power advantage over naive methods, but all methods lost statistical power at low recapture probabilities. 4. the main advantage of mark-recapture methods over naive methods is the ability to control for hidden trait-dependent recapture probability, as it is often hard to tell a priori if trait dependence is an issue in a particular study. however, when trait-dependent recapture probability is weak, naive methods and mark-recapture methods perform similarly as long as recapture rates do not become too low, and the main problem of survival selection studies is still low statistical power. we provide a r package (easymark) alongside with this paper to facilitate future integration between mr methods and classical selection studies. easymark provides the opportunity to convert the regression coefficients from mr-approaches in to classical standardized selection gradients."
extending the latent multinomial model with complex error processes and dynamic markov bases,bayesian inference; markov basis; markov chain monte carlo; mark-recapture; misidentification; queen snake (regina septemvittata),ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,BONNER SJ;SCHOFIELD MR;NOREN P;PRICE SJ,"the latent multinomial model (lmm) of link et al. [biometrics 66 (2010) 178-185] provides a framework for modelling mark-recapture data with potential identification errors. key is a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) scheme for sampling configurations of the latent counts of the true capture histories that could have generated the observed data. assuming a linear map between the observed and latent counts, the mcmc algorithm uses vectors from a basis of the kernel to move between configurations of the latent data. schofield and bonner [biometrics 71 (2015) 1070-1080] shows that this is sufficient for some models within the framework but that a larger set called a markov basis is required when errors are more complex. we address two further challenges: (1) that models with complex error mechanisms may not fit within the lmm framework and (2) that markov bases can be difficult to compute for studies of even moderate size. we extend the framework to model the capture/demographic and error processes separately and develop a new mcmc algorithm using dynamic markov bases. our work is motivated by a study of queen snakes (regina septemvittata) and we use simulation to compare estimates of survival rates when snakes are marked with pit tags which have perfect identification versus brands which are prone to error."
capture-recapture abundance estimation using a semi-complete data likelihood approach,bugs; capture-recapture; closed populations; individual heterogeneity; jags; spatially explicit,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,KING R;MCCLINTOCK BT;KIDNEY D;BORCHERS D,"capture-recapture data are often collected when abundance estimation is of interest. in this manuscript we focus on abundance estimation of closed populations. in the presence of unobserved individual heterogeneity, specified on a continuous scale for the capture probabilities, the likelihood is not generally available in closed form, but expressible only as an analytically intractable integral. model-fitting algorithms to estimate abundance most notably include a numerical approximation for the likelihood or use of a bayesian data augmentation technique considering the complete data likelihood. we consider a bayesian hybrid approach, defining a ""semi-complete"" data likelihood, composed of the product of a complete data likelihood component for individuals seen at least once within the study and a marginal data likelihood component for the individuals not seen within the study, approximated using numerical integration. this approach combines the advantages of the two different approaches, with the semi-complete likelihood component specified as a single integral (over the dimension of the individual heterogeneity component). in addition, the models can be fitted within bugs/jags (commonly used for the bayesian complete data likelihood approach) but with significantly improved computational efficiency compared to the commonly used superpopulation data augmentation approaches (between about 10 and 77 times more efficient in the two examples we consider). the semicomplete likelihood approach is flexible and applicable to a range of models, including spatially explicit capture-recapture models. the model-fitting approach is applied to two different data sets: the first relates to snowshoe hares where model m-h is applied and the second to gibbons where a spatially explicit capture-recapture model is applied."
accounting for lack of independence and partial overlap of observation zones in line-transect mark-recapture distance sampling,abundance estimation; cephalorhynchus hectori hectori; dependent sightings; hector's dolphins; line-transect survey; mark-recapture distance sampling; partial overlap,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,MACKENZIE DI;CLEMENT D,"line-transect mark-recapture distance sampling methods can be used to estimate abundance when at least two observers sight and record distances to detected groups of individuals within the survey area. however, a lack of independence between the observer's detections will cause biased abundance estimates. studies are also typically designed such that there is complete overlap of the regions searched by the two observers, but that may not always be possible. here we detail an intuitive approach for line-transect distance sampling applications based upon logistic regression to account for a potential lack of independence by using the detections of one observer as a covariate in the detection function of the second observer. partial overlap of the observer survey regions can be addressed by constraining detection probability to equal 0 for the respective observer outside of the overlap zone. we show via simulation that the method provides reliable estimates of abundance and is not affected by random unmodeled heterogeneity in detection probability. the method is illustrated by estimating abundance within the covered region of an aerial line-transect survey for new zealand's endemic hector's dolphin (cephalorhynchus hectori hectori) conducted in the austral summer of 2013, the motivating application for this work. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line."
a population-size model for protein spot detection in proteomic studies,binomial mixture; capture-recapture; lower bounds; nonidentifiability,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,MAO CX;CHEN SN;YANG YT,"in proteomic studies, a population of proteins are often examined on a gel using a technique called two-dimensional gel eletrophoresis. the technique separates the protein population into individual protein spots on a two-dimensional gel by isoelectric charge and molecular weight. the resulting gel images are then processed by a software system for spot detection and subsequent analysis. the performance of a spot-detection program is evaluated by the total number of spots that are detected. a popular spot-detection program uses the ""master-slave"" approach, where all spots on ""slave images"" are subsets of the spots on the ""master image."" we argue that this approach potentially misses a large proportion of proteins and propose a model that quantifies the lack of performance. we provide nonparametric estimators for the protein population size and the expected number of proteins to be detected if a ""fusion-gel"" approach was used. using the data from a rat liver proteome study, we estimate that more than half of the protein population is missed by the master-slave approach."

a functional model for characterizing long-distance movement behaviour,argos; bayesian model; canada lynx; functional data analysis; movement modelling; splines; telemetry,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BUDERMAN FE;HOOTEN MB;IVAN JS;SHENK TM,"advancements in wildlife telemetry techniques have made it possible to collect large data sets of highly accurate animal locations at a fine temporal resolution. these data sets have prompted the development of a number of statistical methodologies for modelling animal movement. telemetry data sets are often collected for purposes other than fine-scale movement analysis. these data sets may differ substantially from those that are collected with technologies suitable for fine-scale movement modelling and may consist of locations that are irregular in time, are temporally coarse or have large measurement error. these data sets are time-consuming and costly to collect but may still provide valuable information about movement behaviour. we developed a bayesian movement model that accounts for error from multiple data sources as well as movement behaviour at different temporal scales. the bayesian framework allows us to calculate derived quantities that describe temporally varying movement behaviour, such as residence time, speed and persistence in direction. the model is flexible, easy to implement and computationally efficient. we apply this model to data from colorado canada lynx (lynx canadensis) and use derived quantities to identify changes in movement behaviour."
estimating diversity via frequency ratios,alpha diversity; biodiversity; capture-recapture; characterization of distributions; microbial ecology; species richness,BIOMETRICS,WILLIS A;BUNGE J,"we wish to estimate the total number of classes in a population based on sample counts, especially in the presence of high latent diversity. drawing on probability theory that characterizes distributions on the integers by ratios of consecutive probabilities, we construct a nonlinear regression model for the ratios of consecutive frequency counts. this allows us to predict the unobserved count and hence estimate the total diversity. we believe that this is the first approach to depart from the classical mixed poisson model in this problem. our method is geometrically intuitive and yields good fits to data with reasonable standard errors. it is especially well-suited to analyzing high diversity datasets derived from next-generation sequencing in microbial ecology. we demonstrate the method's performance in this context and via simulation, and we present a dataset for which our method outperforms all competitors."
double-observer line transect surveys with markov-modulated poisson process models for animal availability,abundance estimation; availability bias; cox point process; mark-recapture; maximum likelihood,BIOMETRICS,BORCHERS DL;LANGROCK R,"we develop maximum likelihood methods for line transect surveys in which animals go undetected at distance zero, either because they are stochastically unavailable while within view or because they are missed when they are available. these incorporate a markov-modulated poisson process model for animal availability, allowing more clustered availability events than is possible with poisson availability models. they include a mark-recapture component arising from the independent-observer survey, leading to more accurate estimation of detection probability given availability. we develop models for situations in which (a) multiple detections of the same individual are possible and (b) some or all of the availability process parameters are estimated from the line transect survey itself, rather than from independent data. we investigate estimator performance by simulation, and compare the multiple-detection estimators with estimators that use only initial detections of individuals, and with a single-observer estimator. simultaneous estimation of detection function parameters and availability model parameters is shown to be feasible from the line transect survey alone with multiple detections and double-observer data but not with single-observer data. recording multiple detections of individuals improves estimator precision substantially when estimating the availability model parameters from survey data, and we recommend that these data be gathered. we apply the methods to estimate detection probability from a double-observer survey of north atlantic minke whales, and find that double-observer data greatly improve estimator precision here too."
connecting the latent multinomial,capture-recapture; linear constraint; markov basis; markov chain monte carlo; misidentification,BIOMETRICS,SCHOFIELD MR;BONNER SJ,"link et al. (2010, biometrics 66, 178-185) define a general framework for analyzing capture-recapture data with potential misidentifications. in this framework, the observed vector of counts, y, is considered as a linear function of a vector of latent counts, x, such that y = ax, with x assumed to follow a multinomial distribution conditional on the model parameters, theta. bayesian methods are then applied by sampling from the joint posterior distribution of both x and theta. in particular, link et al. (2010) propose a metropolis-hastings algorithm to sample from the full conditional distribution of x, where new proposals are generated by sequentially adding elements from a basis of the null space (kernel) of a. we consider this algorithm and show that using elements from a simple basis for the kernel of a may not produce an irreducible markov chain. instead, we require a markov basis, as defined by diaconis and sturmfels (1998, the annals of statistics 26, 363-397). we illustrate the importance of markov bases with three capture-recapture examples. we prove that a specific lattice basis is a markov basis for a class of models including the original model considered by link et al. (2010) and confirm that the specific basis used in their example with two sampling occasions is a markov basis. the constructive nature of our proof provides an immediate method to obtain a markov basis for any model in this class."
mixture regression models for closed population capture-recapture data,archimedean copulas; closed population; maximum likelihood; random unit effect; residual heterogeneity; unit level covariates,BIOMETRICS,TOUNKARA F;RIVEST LP,"in capture-recapture studies, the use of individual covariates has been recommended to get stable population estimates. however, some residual heterogeneity might still exist and ignoring such heterogeneity could lead to underestimating the population size (n). in this work, we explore two new models with capture probabilities depending on both covariates and unobserved random effects, to estimate the size of a population. inference techniques including horvitz-thompson estimate and confidence intervals for the population size, are derived. the selection of a particular model is carried out using the akaike information criterion (aic). first, we extend the random effect model of darroch et al. (1993, journal of american statistical association 88, 1137-1148) to handle unit level covariates and discuss its limitations. the second approach is a generalization of the traditional zero-truncated binomial model that includes a random effect to account for an unobserved heterogeneity. this approach provides useful tools for inference about n, since key quantities such as moments, likelihood functions and estimates of n and their standard errors have closed form expressions. several models for the unobserved heterogeneity are available and the marginal capture probability is expressed using the logit and the complementary log-log link functions. the sensitivity of the inference to the specification of a model is also investigated through simulations. a numerical example is presented. we compare the performance of the proposed estimator with that obtained under model m-h of huggins (1989 biometrika 76, 130-140)."
individual heterogeneity in growth and age at sexual maturity: a gamma process analysis of capture-mark-recapture data,hierarchical bayesian analysis; mixed effects; salamanders; von bertalanffy model,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,LINK WA;HESED KM,"knowledge of organisms' growth rates and ages at sexual maturity is important for conservation efforts and a wide variety of studies in ecology and evolutionary biology. however, these life history parameters may be difficult to obtain from natural populations: individuals encountered may be of unknown age, information on age at sexual maturity may be uncertain and interval-censored, and growth data may include both individual heterogeneity and measurement errors. we analyzed mark-recapture data for red-backed salamanders (plethodon cinereus) to compare sex-specific growth rates and ages at sexual maturity. aging of individuals was made possible by the use of a von bertalanffy model of growth, complemented with models for interval-censored and imperfect observations at sexual maturation. individual heterogeneity in growth was modeled through the use of gamma processes. our analysis indicates that female p. cinereus mature earlier and grow more quickly than males, growing to nearly identical asymptotic size distributions as males."
estimating immigration using a bayesian integrated population model: choice of parametrization and priors,bayesian model; immigration; integrated population model; prior sensitivity; source-sink dynamics,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,SCHAUB M;FLETCHER D,"bayesian integrated population modelling provides a natural tool for estimating immigration into a single study population when we have indices of population size, mark-recapture data and fecundity data. we consider the choice of both the parametrization of immigration and its prior. using a simulation study for a model that is typical of those used for short-live bird species, we assess the effect of specifying immigration in terms of the number of immigrants each year, as opposed to an immigration rate. we also assess the effect of the assumption of independence of the data sets, which is commonly required in such modelling. if immigration is occurring, our results suggest that parametrizing the model in terms of number of immigrants will provide a more precise estimate, compared to a parametrization involving an immigration rate, even if we wish to estimate the rate. if there is little or no immigration, use of a model parametrized in terms of an immigration rate can result in overestimation, whereas a model in which immigration is specified as a number offers the possibility to use priors that have a negative lower bound with the consequence that immigration is correctly estimated. use of such a model appears to be robust to the assumption of independence being wrong, our results for independent and dependent data sets being remarkably similar in terms of the distribution, across all simulations, of the posterior means and standard deviations."

a generalised random encounter model for estimating animal density with remote sensor data,acoustic detection; camera traps; marine; population monitoring; simulations; terrestrial,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,LUCAS TCD;MOORCROFT EA;FREEMAN R;ROWCLIFFE JM;JONES KE,"wildlife monitoring technology is advancing rapidly and the use of remote sensors such as camera traps and acoustic detectors is becoming common in both the terrestrial and marine environments. current methods to estimate abundance or density require individual recognition of animals or knowing the distance of the animal from the sensor, which is often difficult. a method without these requirements, the random encounter model (rem), has been successfully applied to estimate animal densities from count data generated from camera traps. however, count data from acoustic detectors do not fit the assumptions of the rem due to the directionality of animal signals. we developed a generalised rem (grem), to estimate absolute animal density from count data from both camera traps and acoustic detectors. we derived the grem for different combinations of sensor detection widths and animal signal widths (a measure of directionality). we tested the accuracy and precision of this model using simulations of different combinations of sensor detection widths and animal signal widths, number of captures and models of animal movement. we find that the grem produces accurate estimates of absolute animal density for all combinations of sensor detection widths and animal signal widths. however, larger sensor detection and animal signal widths were found to be more precise. while the model is accurate for all capture efforts tested, the precision of the estimate increases with the number of captures. we found no effect of different animal movement models on the accuracy and precision of the grem. we conclude that the grem provides an effective method to estimate absolute animal densities from remote sensor count data over a range of sensor and animal signal widths. the grem is applicable for count data obtained in both marine and terrestrial environments, visually or acoustically (e.g. big cats, sharks, birds, echolocating bats and cetaceans). as sensors such as camera traps and acoustic detectors become more ubiquitous, the grem will be increasingly useful for monitoring unmarked animal populations across broad spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales."
analysing mark-recapture-recovery data in the presence of missing covariate data via multiple imputation,individual time-varying continuous covariates; mark-recapture-recovery data; missing values; multiple imputation; two-step algorithm,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,WORTHINGTON H;KING R;BUCKLAND ST,"we consider mark-recapture-recovery data with additional individual time-varying continuous covariate data. for such data it is common to specify the model parameters, and in particular the survival probabilities, as a function of these covariates to incorporate individual heterogeneity. however, an issue arises in relation to missing covariate values, for (at least) the times when an individual is not observed, leading to an analytically intractable likelihood. we propose a two-step multiple imputation approach to obtain estimates of the demographic parameters. firstly, a model is fitted to only the observed covariate values. conditional on the fitted covariate model, multiple ""complete"" datasets are generated (i.e. all missing covariate values are imputed). secondly, for each complete dataset, a closed form complete data likelihood can be maximised to obtain estimates of the model parameters which are subsequently combined to obtain an overall estimate of the parameters. associated standard errors and 95 % confidence intervals are obtained using a non-parametric bootstrap. a simulation study is undertaken to assess the performance of the proposed two-step approach. we apply the method to data collected on a well-studied population of soay sheep and compare the results with a bayesian data augmentation approach. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line."
estimating the size of populations at high risk for hiv using respondent-driven sampling data,hard-to-reach population sampling; model-based survey sampling; network sampling; social networks; successive sampling,BIOMETRICS,HANDCOCK MS;GILE KJ;MAR CM,"the study of hard-to-reach populations presents significant challenges. typically, a sampling frame is not available, and population members are difficult to identify or recruit from broader sampling frames. this is especially true of populations at high risk for hiv/aids. respondent-driven sampling (rds) is often used in such settings with the primary goal of estimating the prevalence of infection. in such populations, the number of people at risk for infection and the number of people infected are of fundamental importance. this article presents a case-study of the estimation of the size of the hard-to-reach population based on data collected through rds. we study two populations of female sex workers and men-who-have-sex-with-men in el salvador. the approach is bayesian and we consider different forms of prior information, including using the unaids population size guidelines for this region. we show that the method is able to quantify the amount of information on population size available in rds samples. as separate validation, we compare our results to those estimated by extrapolating from a capture-recapture study of el salvadorian cities. the results of our case-study are largely comparable to those of the capture-recapture study when they differ from the unaids guidelines. our method is widely applicable to data from rds studies and we provide a software package to facilitate this."
modelling non-euclidean movement and landscape connectivity in highly structured ecological networks,abundance; animal movement; dendritic ecological network; density; ecological distance; functional connectivity; habitat network; stream distance; structural connectivity,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SUTHERLAND C;FULLER AK;ROYLE JA,"movement is influenced by landscape structure, configuration and geometry, but measuring distance as perceived by animals poses technical and logistical challenges. instead, movement is typically measured using euclidean distance, irrespective of location or landscape structure, or is based on arbitrary cost surfaces. a recently proposed extension of spatial capture-recapture (scr) models resolves this issue using spatial encounter histories of individuals to calculate least-cost paths (ecological distance: ecology, 94, 2013, 287) thereby relaxing the euclidean assumption. we evaluate the consequences of not accounting for movement heterogeneity when estimating abundance in highly structured landscapes, and demonstrate the value of this approach for estimating biologically realistic space-use patterns and landscape connectivity. we simulated scr data in a riparian habitat network, using the ecological distance model under a range of scenarios where space-use in and around the landscape was increasingly associated with water (i.e. increasingly less euclidean). to assess the influence of miscalculating distance on estimates of population size, we compared the results from the ecological and euclidean distance based models. we then demonstrate that the ecological distance model can be used to estimate home range geometry when space use is not symmetrical. finally, we provide a method for calculating landscape connectivity based on modelled species-landscape interactions generated from capture-recapture data. using ecological distance always produced unbiased estimates of abundance. explicitly modelling the strength of the species-landscape interaction provided a direct measure of landscape connectivity and better characterised true home range geometry. abundance under the euclidean distance model was increasingly (negatively) biased as space use was more strongly associated with water and, because home ranges are assumed to be symmetrical, produced poor characterisations of home range geometry and no information about landscape connectivity. the ecological distance scr model uses spatially indexed capture-recapture data to estimate how activity patterns are influenced by landscape structure. as well as reducing bias in estimates of abundance, this approach provides biologically realistic representations of home range geometry, and direct information about species-landscape interactions. the incorporation of both structural (landscape) and functional (movement) components of connectivity provides a direct measure of species-specific landscape connectivity."

hidden markov model for dependent mark loss and survival estimation,capture-recapture; cormack-jolly-seber (cjs); hidden markov model; mark loss; tag loss,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,LAAKE JL;JOHNSON DS;DIEFENBACH DR;TERNENT MA,mark-recapture estimators assume no loss of marks to provide unbiased estimates of population parameters. we describe a hidden markov model (hmm) framework that integrates a mark loss model with a cormack-jolly-seber model for survival estimation. mark loss can be estimated with single-marked animals as long as a sub-sample of animals has a permanent mark. double-marking provides an estimate of mark loss assuming independence but dependence can be modeled with a permanently marked sub-sample. we use a log-linear approach to include covariates for mark loss and dependence which is more flexible than existing published methods for integrated models. the hmm approach is demonstrated with a dataset of black bears (ursus americanus) with two ear tags and a subset of which were permanently marked with tattoos. the data were analyzed with and without the tattoo. dropping the tattoos resulted in estimates of survival that were reduced by 0.005-0.035 due to tag loss dependence that could not be modeled. we also analyzed the data with and without the tattoo using a single tag. by not using. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.
mark-resight abundance estimation under incomplete identification of marked individuals,capture-resight; latent variables; mark-recapture; mark-resighting; missing data; population size,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MCCLINTOCK BT;HILL JM;FRITZ L;CHUMBLEY K;LUXA K;DIEFENBACH DR,"often less expensive and less invasive than conventional mark-recapture, so-called 'mark-resight' methods are popular in the estimation of population abundance. these methods are most often applied when a subset of the population of interest is marked (naturally or artificially), and non-invasive sighting data can be simultaneously collected for both marked and unmarked individuals. however, it can often be difficult to identify marked individuals with certainty during resighting surveys, and incomplete identification of marked individuals is potentially a major source of bias in mark-resight abundance estimators. previously proposed solutions are ad hoc and will tend to underperform unless marked individual identification rates are relatively high (>90%) or individual sighting heterogeneity is negligible. based on a complete data likelihood, we present an approach that properly accounts for uncertainty in marked individual detection histories when incomplete identifications occur. the models allow for individual heterogeneity in detection, sampling with (e.g. poisson) or without (e.g. bernoulli) replacement, and an unknown number of marked individuals. using a custom markov chain monte carlo algorithm to facilitate bayesian inference, we demonstrate these models using two example data sets and investigate their properties via simulation experiments. we estimate abundance for grassland sparrow populations in pennsylvania, usa when sampling was conducted with replacement and the number of marked individuals was either known or unknown. to increase marked individual identification probabilities, extensive territory mapping was used to assign incomplete identifications to individuals based on location. despite marked individual identification probabilities as low as 67% in the absence of this territorial mapping procedure, we generally found little return (or need) for this time-consuming investment when using our proposed approach. we also estimate rookery abundance from alaskan steller sea lion counts when sampling was conducted without replacement, the number of marked individuals was unknown, and individual heterogeneity was suspected as non-negligible. in terms of estimator performance, our simulation experiments and examples demonstrated advantages of our proposed approach over previous methods, particularly when marked individual identification probabilities are low and individual heterogeneity levels are high. our methodology can also reduce field effort requirements for marked individual identification, thus, allowing potential investment into additional marking events or resighting surveys."
mc(mc)mc: exploring monte carlo integration within mcmc for mark-recapture models with individual covariates,data augmentation; mark-recapture; markov chain monte carlo; monte carlo integration; monte carlo within mcmc,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BONNER S;SCHOFIELD M,"estimating abundance from mark-recapture data is challenging when capture probabilities vary among individuals. initial solutions to this problem were based on fitting conditional likelihoods and estimating abundance as a derived parameter. more recently, bayesian methods using full likelihoods have been implemented via reversible jump markov chain monte carlo sampling (rjmcmc) or data augmentation (da). the latter approach is easily implemented in available software and has been applied to fit models that allow for heterogeneity in both open and closed populations. however, both rjmcmc and da may be inefficient when modelling large populations. we describe an alternative approach using monte carlo (mc) integration to approximate the posterior density within a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) sampling scheme. we show how this monte carlo within mcmc (mcwm) approach may be used to fit a simple, closed population model including a single individual covariate and present results from a simulation study comparing rjmcmc, da and mcwm. we found that mcwm can provide accurate inference about population size and can be more efficient than both rjmcmc and da. the efficiency of mcwm can also be improved by using advanced mc methods like antithetic sampling. finally, we apply mcwm to estimate the abundance of meadow voles (microtus pennsylvanicus) at the patuxent wildlife research center in 1982 allowing for capture probabilities to vary as a function body mass."
estimating true instead of apparent survival using spatial cormack-jolly-seber models,cormack-jolly-seber model; dispersal; lanius collurio; movement; sampling bias; spatial capture-recapture,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SCHAUB M;ROYLE JA,"survival is often estimated from capture-recapture data using cormack-jolly-seber (cjs) models, where mortality and emigration cannot be distinguished, and the estimated apparent survival probability is the product of the probabilities of true survival and of study area fidelity. consequently, apparent survival is lower than true survival unless study area fidelity equals one. underestimation of true survival from capture-recapture data is a main limitation of the method. we develop a spatial version of the cjs model that allows estimation of true survival. besides the information about whether a specific individual was encountered at a given occasion, it is often recorded where the encounter occurred. thus, information is available about the fraction of dispersal that occurs within the study area, and we use it to model dispersal and estimate true survival. our model is formulated hierarchically and consists of survival, dispersal and observation submodels, assuming that encounters are possible anywhere within a study area. in a simulation study, our new spatial cjs model produced accurate estimates of true survival and dispersal behaviour for various sizes and shapes of the study area, even if emigration is substantial. however, when the information about dispersal is scarce due to low survival, low recapture probabilities and high emigration, the estimators are positively biased. moreover, survival estimates are sensitive to the assumed dispersal kernel. we applied the spatial cjs model to a data set of adult red-backed shrikes (lanius collurio). apparent survival of males (c.05) estimated with the cjs model was larger than in females (c.04), but the application of the spatial cjs model revealed that both sexes had similar survival probabilities (c.06). the mean breeding dispersal distance in females was c.700m, while males dispersed only c.250m between years. spatial cjs models enable study of dispersal and survival independent of study design constraints such as imperfect detection and size of the study area provided that some of the dispersing individuals remain in the study area. we discuss possible extensions of our model: alternative dispersal models and the inclusion of covariates and of a habitat suitability map."

a generalized estimating equations approach for capture-recapture closed population models,capture-recapture experiment; gee; heterogeneity; model selection; population size estimation; qic,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,AKANDA MAS;ALPIZAR JARA R,"the estimation of population density animal population parameters, such as capture probability, population size, or population density, is an important issue in many ecological applications. capture-recapture data may be considered as repeated observations that are often correlated over time. if these correlations are not taken into account then parameter estimates may be biased, possibly producing misleading results. we propose a generalized estimating equations (gee) approach to account for correlation over time instead of assuming independence as in the traditional closed population capture-recapture studies. we also account for heterogeneity among observed individuals and over-dispersion, modelling capture probabilities as a function of covariates. the gee versions of all closed population capture-recapture models and their corresponding estimating equations are proposed. we evaluate the effect of accounting for correlation structures on capture-recapture model selection based on the quasi-likelihood information criterion (qic). an example is used for an illustrative application and for comparison to currently used methodology. a horvitz-thompson-like estimator is used to obtain estimates of population size based on conditional arguments. a simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the gee approach in capture-recapture studies. the gee approach performs well for estimating population parameters, particularly when capture probabilities are high. the simulation results also reveal that estimated population size varies on the nature of the existing correlation among capture occasions."
advances and applications of occupancymodels,amphibian disease; batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; detection probability; dynamic multistate occurrence models; false positive; misidentification; multiscale; study design,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BAILEY LL;MACKENZIE DI;NICHOLS JD,"the past decade has seen an explosion in the development and application of models aimed at estimating species occurrence and occupancy dynamics while accounting for possible non-detection or species misidentification. we discuss some recent occupancy estimation methods and the biological systems that motivated their development. collectively, these models offer tremendous flexibility, but simultaneously place added demands on the investigator. unlike many mark-recapture scenarios, investigators utilizing occupancy models have the ability, and responsibility, to define their sample units (i.e. sites), replicate sampling occasions, time period over which species occurrence is assumed to be static and even the criteria that constitute detection' of a target species. subsequent biological inference and interpretation of model parameters depend on these definitions and the ability to meet model assumptions. we demonstrate the relevance of these definitions by highlighting applications from a single biological system (an amphibian-pathogen system) and discuss situations where the use of occupancy models has been criticized. finally, we use these applications to suggest future research and model development."
spatially explicit integrated population models,count data; detection data; integrated population models; louisiana black bear; population dynamics; spatial capture-recapture; spatial scaling,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CHANDLER RB;CLARK JD,"studies of demographic processes are typically restricted to small geographic areas and short time periods due to the costs of marking and monitoring individuals. however, environmental changes are occurring at much broader spatial and temporal scales, and thus, inferences about the mechanisms governing population dynamics need to be scaled accordingly. recently developed integrated population models (ipms) represent an approach for doing so, by jointly analysing survey data and capture-recapture data. although promising, several shortcomings of conventional ipms exist, including difficulties accounting for spatial variation in demographic, movement and detection parameters; limited ability to make spatially explicit predictions of abundance or vital rates; and a requirement that the survey data and the capture-recapture data are independent. we demonstrate how each of these limitations can be resolved by adopting a spatial population dynamics model upon which both the survey data and the capture-recapture data are conditioned. we applied the model to 6 years of hair data collected on the threatened louisiana black bear ursus americanus luteolus. for years in which the hair samples were genotyped, the resulting data are information-rich (but expensive) spatial capture-recapture (scr) data. for the remaining years, the data are binary detection data, of the type often analysed using occupancy models. we compared estimates of demographic parameters and annual abundance using various combinations of the scr and detection data, and found that combining the scr data and the detection data resulted in more precise estimates of abundance relative to estimates that did not use the detection data. a simulation study provided additional evidence of increased precision, as well as evidence that the estimators of annual abundance are approximately unbiased. the ability to combine survey data and capture-recapture data using a spatially explicit model opens many possibilities for designing cost effective studies and scaling up inferences about the demographic processes influencing spatial and temporal population dynamics."
accounting for behavioural response to capture when estimating population size from hair snare studies with missing data,behavioural response; closed population; dna; hair snare; mark-recapture; missing data,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,AUGUSTINE BC;TREDICK CA;BONNER SJ,"1 hair snares have become an established method for obtaining mark-recapture data for population size estimation of ursids and have recently been used to study other species including other carnivores, small mammals and ungulates. however, bias due to a behavioural response to capture in the presence of missing data has only recently been recognized and no statistical methodology exists to accommodate it. in a hair snare mark-recapture experiment, data can be missing if animals encounter a hair snare without leaving a hair sample, poor-quality samples are not genotyped, a fraction of all samples collected are genotyped due to cost considerations (subsampling) and/or not all genotyped hair samples provide an individual identification. these are all common features of hair snare mark-recapture experiments. here, we present methodology that accounts for a behavioural response to capture in the presence of missing data from (i) subsampling and (ii) failure of hair samples to produce an individual identification. four subprocesses are modelled-animal capture, hair deposition, researcher subsampling and dna amplification with key parameters estimated from functions of the number of hair samples left by individuals at traps. we assess the properties of this methodology (bias and interval coverage) via simulation and then apply this methodology to a previously published data set. our methodology removes bias and provides nominal interval coverage of population size for the simulation scenarios considered. in the example data set, we find that removing 75% of the hair samples leads to a 40% lower estimate of population size. our methodology corrects about half of this bias and we identify a second source of bias that has not previously been reported associated with differential trap visitation rates among individuals within trapping occasions. our methodology will allow researchers to reliably estimate the size of a closed population in the presence of a behavioural response to capture and missing data for a subset of missing data scenarios. it also provides a framework for understanding this generally unrecognized problem and for further extension to handle other missing data scenarios."
using mark-recapture distance sampling methods on line transect surveys,mark-recapture; distance sampling; line transects; double-observer survey; program distance,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BURT ML;BORCHERS DL;JENKINS KJ;MARQUES TA,"1.mark-recapture distance sampling (mrds) methods are widely used for density and abundance estimation when the conventional ds assumption of certain detection at distance zero fails, as they allow detection at distance zero to be estimated and incorporated into the overall probability of detection to better estimate density and abundance. however, incorporating mr data in ds models raises survey and analysis issues not present in conventional ds. conversely, incorporating ds assumptions in mr models raises issues not present in conventional mr. as a result, being familiar with either conventional ds methods or conventional mr methods does not on its own put practitioners in good a position to apply mrds methods appropriately. this study explains the sometimes subtly different varieties of mrds survey methods and the associated concepts underlying mrds models. this is done as far as possible without giving mathematical details - in the hope that this will make the key concepts underlying the methods accessible to a wider audience than if we were to present the concepts via equations. we illustrate use of the two main types of mrds model by using data collected on two different types of survey: a survey of ungulate faecal pellets where two observers searched independently of each other; and a cetacean survey that used a search protocol that could accommodate responsive movement, with only one observer searching independently and the other being aware of all detections.synthesis and applications. mark-recapture ds is a widely used method for estimating animal density and abundance when detection of animals at distance zero is not certain. two observer configurations and three statistical models are described, and it is important to choose the most appropriate model for the observer configuration and target species in question. by way of making the methods more accessible to practicing ecologists, we describe the key ideas underlying mrds methods, the sometimes subtle differences between them, and we illustrate these by applying different kinds of mrds method to surveys of two different target species using different survey configurations."
using integrated population models to improve conservation monitoring: california spotted owls as a case study,california spotted owl; integrated population model; markov chain monte carlo; population analysis; population decline,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,TEMPEL DJ;PEERY MZ;GUTIERREZ RJ,"integrated population models (ipms) constitute a relatively new approach for estimating population trends and demographic parameters that makes use of multiple, independent data sources (e.g., count and mark-recapture data) within a unified statistical framework. in principle, ipms offer several advantages over more conventional modeling approaches that rely on a single source of data, including greater precision in parameter estimates and the ability to estimate demographic parameters for which no explicit data are available. however, to date, the ipm literature has focused primarily on model development and evaluation, and few ""real-world"" applications have demonstrated that ipms can strengthen inferences about population dynamics in a species of conservation concern. here, we combined 23 years of count, occupancy, reproductive, and mark-recapture data into an ipm framework to estimate population trends and demographic rates in a population of california spotted owls (strix occidentalis occidentalis). using this framework, we observed a significant population decline, as evidenced by the geometric mean of the finite annual rate of population change ( <(<(lambda)over bar>(t) )over cap> = 0.969, 95% cri 0.957-0.980) and the resulting realized population change (proportion of the initial population present in 2012; (delta) over cap (2012) = 0.501, 95% cri 0.383-0.641). the estimated decline was considerably greater than the approximately 30% decline estimated using conventional mark-recapture and occupancy approaches (tempel and gutierrez, 2013). the ipm likely yielded a greater decline because it allowed for the inclusion of three years of data from the beginning of the study that were omitted from previous analyses to meet the assumptions of mark-recapture models. the ipm may also have yielded a greater estimate of decline than occupancy models owing to an increase in the number of territories occupied by single owls over the study period. all demographic parameters (adult and juvenile apparent survival, reproductive rate, immigration rate) were positively correlated with (lambda) over cap (t), but immigration was fairly high ((immt) over cap = 0.097, 95% cri 0.055-0.140) and contributed most to temporal variation in (lambda) over cap (t), suggesting that changes in owl abundance were influenced by processes occurring outside of our study area. more broadly, our results indicated that the ipm framework has the potential to strengthen inference in population monitoring and demographic studies, particularly for those involving long-lived species whose abundance may be slowly declining. in our case, the conservation implications from the results of the ipm suggested a decline in the population of owls that was steeper than previously thought.

dead before detection: addressing the effects of left truncation on survival estimation and ecological inference for neonates,age-dependent survival; truncated data; mark recapture; population ecology; survival analysis; wildlife; neonate,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,GILBERT SL;LINDBERG MS;HUNDERTMARK KJ;PERSON DK,"<list list-type=""1"" id=""mee312234-list-0001""> neonate survival is a key life history trait, yet remains challenging to measure in wild populations because neonates can be difficult to capture at birth. estimates of survival from neonates that are opportunistically captured might be inaccurate because some individuals die before sampling, resulting in data that are left truncated. the resulting overestimation of survival rates can further affect ecological inference through biased estimates of covariate effects in survival models, yet is not addressed in most studies of animal survival. here, we quantify the effects of left truncation on survival estimates and subsequent ecological inference. vaginal implant transmitters (vits) enable capture of ungulates at birth, yielding data without left truncation. the effects of left truncation on survival estimation were quantified using age-dependent survival models for vit and opportunistically captured neonatal deer. differences in daily survival rates (dsrs) and cumulative survival probability were calculated for the first 70days of life. in addition, left truncation was simulated by removing fawns that died during the first 1 or 2days of life from the vit-caught sample, isolating the effect of left truncation. cumulative probability of survival during the first 70days of life was overestimated by 7-23% for fawns caught opportunistically compared with those caught by vit, depending on model design. differences in dsrs were large at age 1day, but had converged by age 30days. simulated left truncation resulted in overestimates of survival of up to 31%. model selection and covariate coefficients were strongly affected by left truncation, producing spurious ecological inference, including changes to sign and/or magnitude of inferred effects of all covariates. we recommend (i) every effort be made to capture neonates; (ii) consistent capture methods, using at least in part non-truncating techniques, be implemented across years and study areas; and (iii) exclusion of left-truncated data from survival estimates until dsrs converge with those calculated from non-truncated data. this work emphasizes the importance of accounting for left truncation in survival estimation for any species with strong age-dependent survival in order to prevent biased conclusions produced by sampling method rather than true ecological effects. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(issn)2041-210x</doi"

hierarchical modeling of abundance in closed population capture-recapture models under heterogeneity,bayesian; capture recapture; complete data likelihood; data augmentation; hierarchical; mcmc; reversible jump; superpopulation; trans-dimensional,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,SCHOFIELD MR;BARKER RJ,"hierarchical modeling of abundance in space or time using closed-population mark-recapture under heterogeneity (model) presents two challenges: (i) finding a flexible likelihood in which abundance appears as an explicit parameter and (ii) fitting the hierarchical model for abundance. the first challenge arises because abundance not only indexes the population size, it also determines the dimension of the capture probabilities in heterogeneity models. a common approach is to use data augmentation to include these capture probabilities directly into the likelihood and fit the model using bayesian inference via markov chain monte carlo (mcmc). two such examples of this approach are (i) explicit trans-dimensional mcmc, and (ii) superpopulation data augmentation. the superpopulation approach has the advantage of simple specification that is easily implemented in bugs and related software. however, it reparameterizes the model so that abundance is no longer included, except as a derived quantity. this is a drawback when hierarchical models for abundance, or related parameters, are desired. here, we analytically compare the two approaches and show that they are more closely related than might appear superficially. we exploit this relationship to specify the model in a way that allows us to include abundance as a parameter and that facilitates hierarchical modeling using readily available software such as bugs. we use this approach to model trends in grizzly bear abundance in yellowstone national park from 1986 to 1998."
fitting animal survival models with temporal random effects,band return; generalized linear mixed models; r software; ring recoveries; schall's algorithm,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,CUBAYNES S;LAVERGNE C;GIMENEZ O,estimating temporal variance in animal demographic parameters is of particular importance in population biology. we implement the schall's algorithm for incorporating temporal random effects in survival models using recovery data. our frequentist approach is based on a formulation of band-recovery models with random effects as generalized linear mixed models and a linearization of the link function conditional on the random effects. a simulation study shows that our procedure provides unbiased and precise estimates. the method is then implemented on two case studies using recovery data on fish and birds.

bias from heterogeneous usage of space in spatially explicit capture-recapture analyses,bias; density estimates; heterogeneity; home range; resource selection function; rsf; secr; spatially explicit capture-recapture,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,EFFORD MG,"1. royle et al. (methods in ecology and evolution, 2013, 4, 520) proposed a spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) model in which an animal's usage of a site, and hence its probability of detection, depends on a function of site-specific covariates normalized using a weighted sum of such values across the animal's home range. 2. from simulations supposedly based on the model, they drew the conclusion that existing methods will produce 'extremely biased' estimates of population size when animals use space selectively. this conclusion is faulty because they simulated data from a different model, omitting the normalization needed to represent selection of resources at the home-range level. 3. new simulations show that the null secr estimator of population size is nearly unbiased for low to moderate levels of selective space use when the generating model includes normalization. including detector-level covariates of detection, as allowed in standard software, nearly eliminates bias due to strongly selective space use, whether or not the generating model includes normalization."
reply to efford on 'integrating resource selection information with spatial capture-recapture',animal population sampling; capture-recapture; density estimation; modelling; population ecology,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ROYLE JA;CHANDLER RB;SUN CC;FULLER AK,"1. we proposed (methods in ecology and evolution, 2013, 4) a model for combining telemetry data with spatial capture-recapture (scr) data that was vigorously criticized by efford (methods in ecology and evolution, 2014, 000, 000). efford's main claim was that our encounter probability model was incorrect, and therefore our r code and simulation results were wrong. 2. in fact, our encounter probability model is correct under the poisson point process model that we used as a basis for our integrated model. on the other hand, the basis for efford's claims clearly rest on the assumption of an alternative model which, while possibly useful, is distinct from that analysed in royle et al. (methods in ecology and evolution, 2013, 4). 3. a key point of royle et al. (methods in ecology and evolution, 2013, 4) was that active resource selection induces heterogeneity in encounter probability which, if unaccounted for, should bias estimates of population size or density. the models of royle et al. (methods in ecology and evolution, 2013, 4) and efford (methods in ecology and evolution, 2014, 000, 000) merely amount to alternative models of resource selection, and hence varying amounts of heterogeneity in encounter probability."
estimating population size in the presence of temporary migration using a joint analysis of telemetry and capture-recapture data,bayesian methods; modelling; population ecology; sampling; statistics,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BIRD T;LYON J;NICOL S;MCCARTHY M;BARKER R,"1. temporary migration - where individuals can leave and re-enter a sampled population - is a feature of many capture-mark-recapture (cmr) studies of mobile populations which, if unaccounted for, can lead to biased estimates of population capture probabilities and consequently biased estimates of population abundance. 2. we present a method for incorporating radiotelemetry data within a cmr study to eliminate bias due to temporary migration using a bayesian state-space model. 3. our results indicate that using a relatively small number of telemetry tags, it is possible to greatly reduce bias in estimates of capture probabilities using telemetry data to model transition probabilities in and out of the sampling area. in a capture-recapture data set for trout cod in the murray river, australia, accounting for temporary migration led to overall higher estimates of capture probabilities than models assuming permanent or zero migration. also, individual heterogeneity in detectability can be managed through explicit modelling. we show how accounting for temporary migration when estimating capture probabilities can be used to estimate the abundance and size distribution of a population as though it were closed. 4. our model provides a basis for more complex models that might integrate telemetry data into other cmr scenarios, thus allowing for greater precision in estimates of vital rates that might otherwise be biased by temporary migration. our results highlight the importance of accounting for migration in survey design and parameter estimation, and the potential scope for supplementing large-scale cmr data sets with a subset of auxiliary data that provide information on processes that are hidden to primary sampling processes."
"continuous-time spatially explicit capture-recapture models, with an application to a jaguar camera-trap survey",animal movement; data aggregation; density estimation; statistical methods; sufficiency,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BORCHERS D;DISTILLER G;FOSTER R;HARMSEN B;MILAZZO L,"1. many capture-recapture surveys of wildlife populations operate in continuous time, but detections are typically aggregated into occasions for analysis, even when exact detection times are available. this discards information and introduces subjectivity, in the form of decisions about occasion definition. 2. we develop a spatiotemporal poisson process model for spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) surveys that operate continuously and record exact detection times. we show that, except in some special cases (including the case in which detection probability does not change within occasion), temporally aggregated data do not provide sufficient statistics for density and related parameters, and that when detection probability is constant over time, our continuous-time (ct) model is equivalent to an existing model based on detection frequencies. we use the model to estimate jaguar density from a camera-trap survey and conduct a simulation study to investigate the properties of a ct estimator and discrete-occasion estimators with various levels of temporal aggregation. this includes investigation of the effect on the estimators of spatiotemporal correlation induced by animal movement. 3. the ct estimator is found to be unbiased and more precise than discrete-occasion estimators based on binary capture data (rather than detection frequencies) when there is no spatiotemporal correlation. it is also found to be only slightly biased when there is correlation induced by animal movement, and to be more robust to inadequate detector spacing, while discrete-occasion estimators with binary data can be sensitive to occasion length, particularly in the presence of inadequate detector spacing. 4. our model includes as a special case a discrete-occasion estimator based on detection frequencies, and at the same time lays a foundation for the development of more sophisticated ct models and estimators. it allows modelling within-occasion changes in detectability, readily accommodates variation in detector effort, removes subjectivity associated with user-defined occasions and fully utilizes ct data. we identify a need for developing ct methods that incorporate spatiotemporal dependence in detections and see potential for ct models being combined with telemetry-based animal movement models to provide a richer inference framework."

limited-information modeling of loggerhead turtle population size,bayesian methods; capture-recapture; ecological applications; environmental applications; gibbs sampling; mark-recapture; renewal process,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,GREGO JM;HITCHCOCK DB,"we attempt to estimate the size of a population of female loggerhead turtles. in traditional capture-recapture experiments to estimate the size of an animal population, individual animals are tagged and the information about which individuals are captured repeatedly is crucial. for these loggerhead turtle data, information about individual turtles is not available. rather, we observe only the counts of successful and failed nestings at a location over a series of days (in our case, three). we view the turtles' nesting behavior as an alternating renewal process, model it using parametric distributions, and then derive probability distributions that describe the behavior of the turtles during the three days via a 3-way contingency table. we adopt a bayesian approach, formulating our model in terms of parameters about which strong prior information is available. we use a gibbs sampling algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution of our random quantities, the most crucial of which is the number of turtles remaining offshore during the entire sampling period. we illustrate the method using data sets from loggerhead turtle sites along the south carolina coast. we provide a simulation study which illustrates the quality and robustness of the method and investigates sensitivity to prior parameter specification."

using social structure to improve mortality estimates: an example with sperm whales,likelihood; management; mark-recapture; physeter macrocephalus; population parameters; social organization; status; stock assessment; survival,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,WHITEHEAD H;GERO S,"estimates of mortality are fundamental to studies of population ecology and assessments of conservation status. mortality is frequently estimated using individual identifications by means of mark-recapture methods. these estimates become biased with heterogeneity in identification and especially if patterns of heterogeneity change with time. if animals are social, then survival may be inferred from the identifications of social partners. we produce a likelihood model for estimating mortality using such social data. we show using simulation that this method can produce less biased and more precise estimates of mortality than standard methods when individuals are almost always identified with associates, and when there are time-varying patterns of heterogeneity in identifiability. the method seems little affected by some change in social affiliations or by growth or decline in population size. ses and confidence intervals of mortality estimates can be estimated using likelihood methods. we apply the method to data from a population of sperm whales (physeter macrocephalus) in the eastern caribbean, obtaining estimates that are more precise and probably less biased than those from other methods. the method should be useful in improving mortality estimates for social species."

estimating individual animal movement from observation networks,acoustic telemetry; detection probability; ornstein-uhlenbeck process; state-space model,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,PEDERSEN MW;WENG KC,"observation network data comprise animal presences detected by observer stations at fixed spatial locations. statistical analysis of these data is complicated by spatial bias in sampling and temporal variability in detection conditions. advanced methods for analysis of these data are required but are currently underdeveloped. we propose a state-space model (ssm) for observation network data to estimate detailed movements of individual animals. the underlying movement model is an ornstein-uhlenbeck (ou) process, which is stationary, and therefore has an inherent mechanism that models home range behaviour. an integral part of the approach is the detection function, which models the probability of logging animal presences. the detection function is also used to provide absence information when animals are undetected. since the ability to detect an animal often depends on time-varying external factors such as environmental conditions, we use covariate information about detection efficiency as control variables. via simulation, we found that movement estimation error scales log-linearly with network sparsity. this result can be used to indicate the number of stations necessary to achieve a desired upper bound on estimation error. furthermore, we found that the ssm outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimating detailed movements and that estimates are robust towards mis-specification of the detection function. we also tested the importance of accounting for time-varying detection conditions and found that the probability of making wrong conclusions decreases substantially when covariate information is exploited. the model is used to estimate movements and home range of a humphead wrasse (cheilinus undulatus) at palmyra atoll in the central pacific ocean. here, detection conditions have a strong diel component, which is controlled for using detection efficiency information from a reference device. the presented approach enhances the toolbox for analysis of observation network data as collected by acoustic telemetry or potentially other aspiring methods such as camera trapping and mobile phone tagging. by explicitly modelling movement and observation processes, the model integrates all sources of uncertainty and provides a sound statistical basis for making well-informed management decisions from imperfect information."

program simassem: software for simulating species assemblages and estimating species richness,biodiversity; community ecology; landscape ecology; relative abundance distribution; simulation; spatial aggregation,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,REESE GC;WILSON KR;FLATHER CH,"1. species richness, the number of species in a defined area, is the most frequently used biodiversity measure. despite its intuitive appeal and conceptual simplicity, species richness is often difficult to quantify, even in well-surveyed areas, because of sampling limitations such as survey effort and species detection probability. nonparametric estimators have generally performed better than other options, but no particular estimator has consistently performed best across variation in assemblage and survey parameters. 2. in order to evaluate estimator performances, we developed the program simassem. simassem can: (i) simulate assemblages and surveys with user-specified parameters, (ii) process existing species encounter history files, (iii) generate species richness estimates not available in other programs and (iv) format encounter history data for several other programs. 3. simassem can help elucidate relationships between assemblage and survey parameters and the performance of species richness estimators, thereby increasing our understanding of estimator sensitivity, improving estimator development and defining the bounds for appropriate application."

varyingeffort incapture-recapture studies,asynchronous sampling; binomial distribution; data pooling; dna; grizzly bear; hazard; spatially explicit capture-recapture; secr; ursus arctos,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,EFFORD MG;BORCHERS DL;MOWAT G,"1. the standard spatial capture-recapture design for sampling animal populations uses a fixed array of detectors, each operated for the same time. however, methods are needed to deal with the unbalanced data that may result from unevenness of effort due to logistical constraints, partial equipment failure or pooling of data for analysis. 2. we describe adjustments for varying effort for three types of data each with a different probability distribution for the number of observations per individual per detector per sampling occasion. a linear adjustment to the expected count is appropriate for poisson-distributed counts (e.g. faeces per searched quadrat). a linear adjustment on the hazard scale is appropriate for binary (bernoulli-distributed) observations at either traps or binary proximity detectors (e.g. automatic cameras). data pooled from varying numbers of binary detectors have a binomial distribution; adjustment is achieved by varying the size parameter of the binomial. 3. we compared a hazard-based adjustment to a more conventional covariate approach in simulations of one temporal and one spatial scenario for varying effort. the hazard-based approach was the more parsimonious and appeared more resistant to bias and confounding. 4. we analysed a dataset comprising dna identifications of female grizzly bears ursus arctos sampled asynchronously with hair snares in british columbia in 2007. adjustment for variation in sampling interval had negligible effect on density estimates, but unmasked an apparent decline in detection probability over the season. duration-dependent decay in sample quality is an alternative explanation for the decline that could be included in future models. 5. allowing for known variation in effort ensures that estimates of detection probability relate to a consistent unit of effort and improves the fit of detection models. failure to account for varying effort may result in confounding between effort and density variation in time or space. adjustment for effort allows rigorous analysis of unbalanced data with little extra cost in terms of precision or processing time. we suggest it should become routine in capture-recapture analyses. the methods have been made available in the r package secr."
estimating age-specific survival when age is unknown: open population capture-recapture models with age structure and heterogeneity,brushtail possums; finite mixtures; senescence,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MATECHOU E;PLEDGER S;EFFORD M;MORGAN BJT;THOMSON DL,"1. when studying senescence in wildlife populations, we are often limited by the sparseness of the available information on the ages of the individuals under study. additionally, heterogeneity between individuals can be substantial. ignoring this heterogeneity can lead to biased estimates of the population parameters of interest and can mask senescence. 2. this article demonstrates the use of a recently developed capture-recapture model for extracting age-dependent estimates of survival probabilities for individuals of unknown age and extends the model by allowing for heterogeneity in survival and capture probabilities using finite mixtures. 3.using simulation, we show that the estimates of age-dependent survival probabilities when age is unknown can be biased when heterogeneity in capture probabilities is not modelled, in contrast to the case of time-dependent survival probabilities when the estimates are robust to similar violations of model assumptions. 4. the methods are demonstrated using a long-term data set of female brushtail possums (trichosurus vulpecula kerr) for which age-specific models for survival probabilities indicating senescence are strongly favoured. we found no evidence of heterogeneity in survival but strong evidence of heterogeneity in capture probabilities. 5. these models have a wide range of applications for estimating age dependence in survival when the age is unknown as they can be applied to any capture-recapture data set, as long as it is collected over a period which is longer, and preferably considerably so, than the life span of the species studied."
integrating resource selection information with spatial capture-recapture,animal movement; animal sampling; encounter probability; hierarchical modeling; marginal likelihood; resource selection; space usage; spatial capture-recapture,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ROYLE JA;CHANDLER RB;SUN CC;FULLER AK,"understanding space usage and resource selection is a primary focus of many studies of animal populations. usually, such studies are based on location data obtained from telemetry, and resource selection functions (rsfs) are used for inference. another important focus of wildlife research is estimation and modeling population size and density. recently developed spatial capture-recapture (scr) models accomplish this objective using individual encounter history data with auxiliary spatial information on location of capture. scr models include encounter probability functions that are intuitively related to rsfs, but to date, no one has extended scr models to allow for explicit inference about space usage and resource selection. in this paper we develop the first statistical framework for jointly modeling space usage, resource selection, and population density by integrating scr data, such as from camera traps, mist-nets, or conventional catch traps, with resource selection data from telemetered individuals. we provide a framework for estimation based on marginal likelihood, wherein we estimate simultaneously the parameters of the scr and rsf models. our method leads to increases in precision for estimating parameters of ordinary scr models. importantly, we also find that scr models alone can estimate parameters of rsfs and, as such, scr methods can be used as the sole source for studying space-usage; however, precision will be higher when telemetry data are available. finally, we find that scr models using standard symmetric and stationary encounter probability models may not fully explain variation in encounter probability due to space usage, and therefore produce biased estimates of density when animal space usage is related to resource selection. consequently, it is important that space usage be taken into consideration, if possible, in studies focused on estimating density using capture-recapture methods."
response to: a new method for estimating animal abundance with two sources of data in capture-recapture studies,genetic markers; mark-recapture; multiple marks; non-invasive marks; photo-identification,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BONNER S,"mark-recapture studies that rely on multiple marks to identify individuals pose modeling challenges if the marks for each individual are not always linked. if an individual with unlinked marks is encountered on two occasions and different marks are observed, then it will appear that two different individuals were captured. failing to account for these missed matches will produce incorrect inference. madon etal. (methods in ecology and evolution 2011; 2: 390) proposes a modification of the jolly-seber estimator for such data computed by adjusting the observed counts of individuals first captured, recaptured or not captured but known to be alive on each occasion. the adjustment involves multiplying each of these counts by a constant factor, iid, intended to correct for double counting of individuals and constrained between 0 and 1. results of a simulation study provided in madon etal. (methods in ecology and evolution 2011; 2: 390) show that the proposed estimator is almost unbiased, but its uncertainty is underestimated and the true coverage of confidence intervals is consistently below the nominal value. i compute separate adjustment factors for each of the counts and show (i) that a constant adjustment is not appropriate and (ii) that the theoretical adjustment factor is sometimes >1. i believe that the use of a single adjustment factor between 0 and 1 is what causes the uncertainty to be underestimated and that complete models of the observation process are required to obtain valid results."

analysis of photo-id data allowing for missed matches and individuals identified from opposite sides,grey seal; markrecapture; maximum likelihood; photo-id; population studies; survival,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,HIBY L;PATERSON WD;REDMAN P;WATKINS J;TWISS SD;POMEROY P,"in many species, photo-identification could be used as an alternative to artificial marking to provide data on demographic parameters. however, unless the population is very small or fragmented, software may be required to pre-screen and reject most image pairs as potential matches. depending on the species and method used to obtain images, currently available software may falsely reject some matches. we estimate the false rejection rate (frr) of the extractcompare (ec) program when used to pre-screen images of female grey seals. filtering images manually to reduce the frr involves subjective assessment of image quality, reduces the amount of data available and may bias the results in favour of relatively well-marked individuals. the data may contain individuals identified only from the left side or the right side, as well as individuals identified from both sides. missed matches resulting from false rejections by pre-screening software and/or inclusion of individuals identified only from opposite sides cause some individuals to generate multiple encounter histories. we describe an open population model for data of this type which, given a measured risk of missing a match between a randomly selected pair of images of the same individual, provides maximum likelihood (ml) estimates of initial population size, survival/emigration and immigration/recruitment by calculating the expected frequency of any encounter history that could be generated. as a case study for the method, we used ec to pre-screen photographs of female grey seals on a breeding colony and generate encounter histories over five successive seasons. allowing for the measured frr, we calculated ml estimates for comparison with estimates from previous studies. we also used the model with encounter histories simulated using the same frr to give the same mixture of left side, right side and both sides histories and derived ml estimates for comparison with the values used to drive the simulation. with frr set at up to 33%, the method gave estimates of the abundance and survival parameters used in the simulation model that were biased by at most 4 center dot 7% up and 3% down, respectively. the results of the grey seal case study were consistent with previous estimates of apparent survival and trends in abundance."

people born in the middle east but residing in the netherlands: invariant population size estimates and the role of active and passive covariates,population size estimation; capture-recapture; collapsibility; multiple record-systems estimation; missing data; structural zeros,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,VAN DER HEIJDEN PGM;WHITTAKER J;CRUYFF M;BAKKER B;VAN DER VLIET R,"including covariates in loglinear models of population registers improves population size estimates for two reasons. first, it is possible to take heterogeneity of inclusion probabilities over the levels of a covariate into account; and second, it allows subdivision of the estimated population by the levels of the covariates, giving insight into characteristics of individuals that are not included in any of the registers. the issue of whether or not marginalizing the full table of registers by covariates over one or more covariates leaves the estimated population size estimate invariant is intimately related to collapsibility of contingency tables [biometrika 70 (1983) 567-578]. we show that, with information from two registers, population size invariance is equivalent to the simultaneous collapsibility of each margin consisting of one register and the covariates. we give a short path characterization of the loglinear model which describes when marginalizing over a covariate leads to different population size estimates. covariates that are collapsible are called passive, to distinguish them from covariates that are not collapsible and are termed active. we make the case that it can be useful to include passive covariates within the estimation model, because they allow a finer description of the population in terms of these covariates. as an example we discuss the estimation of the population size of people born in the middle east but residing in the netherlands."
estimating abundance of cryptic but trappable animals using trapping point transects: a case study for key largo woodrats,abundance estimation; capture-recapture; distance sampling; key largo; neotoma floridana smalli; rodents; small mammals; woodrat,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,POTTS JM;BUCKLAND ST;THOMAS L;SAVAGE A,"1. obtaining robust abundance or density estimates is problematic for many rare or cryptic species. we combine elements of capturerecapture and distance sampling, to develop a method called trapping point transects (tpt), and we applied this method to estimate the abundance of the endangered key largo woodrat (neotoma floridana smalli). 2. trapping point transects requires two separate surveys to be held concurrently in space and time. in the main survey, the encounter rate (number of animals caught per trap per session) is measured. in the trial survey, animals whose locations are known prior to opening traps are used to estimate the detection function g(r) (the probability of capturing an animal given it is distance r from a trap when it is set), so the effective trapping area in the main survey can be estimated. it is assumed animals in the trial survey are a representative sample of all animals in the population. individual heterogeneity in trappability is accommodated using random effects in g(r). 3. performance of two tpt estimators was assessed by simulation. generally, when underlying capture probabilities were high [g(0) = 0.8] and between-individual variation was small, modest survey effort (360 trap nights in the trial survey) generated little bias in estimated abundance (c. 5%). uncertainty and relative bias in population estimates increased with decreasing capture probabilities and increasing between-individual variation. survey effort required to obtain unbiased estimates was also investigated. 4. given the challenges of working with cryptic, sparse or nocturnal species, we tested the validity of this method to estimate the abundance of the key largo woodrats between 2008 and 2011. 5. trapping point transects was found to be an effective monitoring method yielding annual estimates of the extant wild population of 693, 248, 78 and 256 animals, with cvs of 0.45, 0.55, 0.82 and 0.43, respectively. the tpt method could be adapted to a range of species that are otherwise very difficult to monitor."

simple estimation and test procedures in capture-mark-recapture mixed models,capture-mark-recapture; environmental covariates; glmm; mixed models; population dynamics; random effects,BIOMETRICS,LEBRETON JD;CHOQUET R;GIMENEZ O,"the need to consider in capture-recapture models random effects besides fixed effects such as those of environmental covariates has been widely recognized over the last years. however, formal approaches require involved likelihood integrations, and conceptual and technical difficulties have slowed down the spread of capturerecapture mixed models among biologists. in this article, we evaluate simple procedures to test for the effect of an environmental covariate on parameters such as time-varying survival probabilities in presence of a random effect corresponding to unexplained environmental variation. we show that the usual likelihood ratio test between fixed models is strongly biased, and tends to detect too often a covariate effect. permutation and analysis of deviance tests are shown to behave properly and are recommended. permutation tests are implemented in the latest version of program e-surge. our approach also applies to generalized linear mixed models."

assessing individual heterogeneity using model selection criteria: how many mixture components in capture-recapture models?,capture-recapture; classification; individual heterogeneity; information criteria; mixture models; simulation experiment,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CUBAYNES S;LAVERGNE C;MARBOUTIN E;GIMENEZ O,"1. capturerecapture mixture models are important tools in evolution and ecology to estimate demographic parameters and abundance while accounting for individual heterogeneity. a key step is to select the correct number of mixture components i) to provide unbiased estimates that can be used as reliable proxies of fitness or ingredients in management strategies and ii) classify individuals into biologically meaningful classes. however, there is no consensus method in the statistical literature for selecting the number of components. 2. in ecology, most studies rely on the akaike information criterion (aic) and the bayesian information criterion (bic) that has recently gained attention in ecology. the integrated completed likelihood criterion (icl; ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 2000, 22, 719) was specifically developed to favour well-separated components, but its use has never been investigated in ecology. 3. we compared the performance of aic, bic and icl for selecting the number of components with regard to a) bias and accuracy of survival and detection estimates and b) success in selecting the true number of components using extensive simulations and data on wolf (canis lupus) that were used for management through survival and abundance estimation. 4. bias in survival and detection estimates was <0.02 for both aic and bic, and more than 0.09 for icl, while mean square error was <0.05 for all criteria. as expected, bias increased as heterogeneity increased. success rates of aic and bic in selecting the true number of components were better than icl (68% for aic, 58% for bic, and 16% for icl). as the degree of heterogeneity increased, aic (and bic in a lesser extent) overestimated the number of components, while icl often underestimated this number. for the wolf study, the 2-class model was selected by bic and icl, while aic could not decide between the 2- and 3-class models. 5. we recommend using aic or bic when the aim is to estimate parameters. regarding classification, we suggest taking the classification quality into account by using icl in conjunction with bic, pending further work to adapt its penalty term for capturerecapture data."

when can we ignore the problem of imperfect detection in comparative studies?,biodiversity monitoring; capture-mark-recapture; comparative studies; detection probability; nonparametric estimator; population size; sampling design; simulations; type i error,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ARCHAUX F;HENRY PY;GIMENEZ O,"1. numbers of individuals or species are often recorded to test for variations in abundance or richness between treatments, habitat types, ecosystem management types, experimental treatments, time periods, etc. however, a difference in mean detectability among treatments is likely to lead to the erroneous conclusion that mean abundance differs among treatments. no guidelines exist to determine the maximum acceptable difference in detectability. 2. in this study, we simulated count data with imperfect detectability for two treatments with identical mean abundance (n) and number of plots (n(plots)) but different mean detectability (p). we then estimated the risk of erroneously concluding that n differed between treatments because the difference in p was ignored. the magnitude of the risk depended on p, nand nplots. 3. our simulations showed that even small differences in p can dramatically increase this risk. a detectability difference as small as 4-8% can lead to a 50-90% risk of erroneously concluding that a significant difference in n exists among treatments with identical n = 50 and n(plots) = 50. yet, differences in p of this magnitude among treatments or along gradients are commonplace in ecological studies. 4. fortunately, simple methods of accounting for imperfect detectability prove effective at removing detectability difference between treatments. 5. considering the high sensitivity of statistical tests to detectability differences among treatments, we conclude that accounting for detectability by setting up a replicated design, applied to at least part of the design scheme and analysing data with appropriate statistical tools, is always worthwhile when comparing count data (abundance, richness)."
bias in estimation of adult survival and asymptotic population growth rate caused by undetected capture heterogeneity,bias; capture heterogeneity; mark-recapture; maximum population growth rate; population growth rate; population model; survival,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,FLETCHER D;LEBRETON JD;MARESCOT L;SCHAUB M;GIMENEZ O;DAWSON S;SLOOTEN E,"1. markrecapture studies are often used to estimate adult survival probability , which is an important demographic parameter for long-lived species, as it can have a large impact on the population growth rate. we consider the impact of variation in capture probability among individuals (capture heterogeneity) on the estimation of ? from a markrecapture study and thence on estimation of the asymptotic population growth rate . 2. we review the mechanisms by which capture heterogeneity arises, methods of allowing for it in the analysis, and use simulation to assess the power of detecting three types of capture heterogeneity (two-group heterogeneity, trap-response and temporary emigration) using standard mark-recapture lack-of-fit tests. 3. we use simulation to assess the bias that can arise in the estimation of phi from a mark-recapture study when we do not allow for capture heterogeneity. using a generic population model, we assess the effect this bias has on estimation of lambda. 4. we use our results on the power of the lack-of-fit tests, together with a measure of the size of the bias relative to the standard error of the estimate of phi, to assess which situations might lead to an important level of undetected bias. our results suggest that undetected bias is not likely to be an issue when there is trap-response, owing to the lack-of-fit tests having sufficient power to detect any trap-response that could lead to non-negligible bias. for two-group heterogeneity, the worst bias generally occurs when the difference between the capture probabilities for the two groups is moderate and both capture probabilities are low. for temporary emigration, the worst bias generally occurs when the rate of emigration and the capture probability are both low. 5. we illustrate the issues for conservation management using data from studies of hector's dolphin (cephalorhynchus hectori) in new zealand and wolves (canis lupus) in france. 6. previous studies have suggested that capture heterogeneity will generally lead to a relatively small bias in the estimate of phi. however, given the high sensitivity of the asymptotic population growth rate to adult survival, a small bias in phi might lead to nontrivial bias in the estimate of lambda."
spatial capture-recapture models for search-encounter data,bayesian analysis; data augmentation; density estimation; distance sampling; hierarchical models; population size; search-encounter data; spatial capture-recapture; spatially explicit capture-recapture,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ROYLE JA;KERY M;GUELAT J,"1. spatial capturerecapture models make use of auxiliary data on capture location to provide density estimates for animal populations. previously, models have been developed primarily for fixed trap arrays which define the observable locations of individuals by a set of discrete points. 2. here, we develop a class of models for ` search-encounter' data, i. e. for detections of recognizable individuals in continuous space, not restricted to trap locations. in our hierarchical model, detection probability is related to the average distance between individual location and the survey path. the locations are allowed to change over time owing to movements of individuals, and individual locations are related formally by a model describing individual activity or home range centre which is itself regarded as a latent variable in the model. we provide a bayesian analysis of the model in winbugs, and develop a custommcmcalgorithm in ther language. 3. the model is applied to simulated data and to territory mapping data for the willow tit from the swiss breeding bird survey mhb. while the observed density was 15 territories per nominal 1 km 2 plot of unknown effective sample area, the model produced a density estimate of 21 12 territories per square km(95% posterior interval: 17-26). 4. spatial capture-recapture models are relevant to virtually all animal population studies that seek to estimate population size or density, yet existing models have been proposed mainly for conventional sampling using arrays of traps. our model for search-encounter data, where the spatial pattern of searching can be arbitrary and may change over occasions, greatly expands the scope and utility of spatial capture-recapture models."

smoothing population size estimates for time-stratified mark-recapture experiments using bayesian p-splines,atlantic salmon; bayesian inference; hierarchical model; mark-recapture; openbugs; penalized spline; stratified petersen,BIOMETRICS,BONNER SJ;SCHWARZ CJ,"petersen-type markrecapture experiments are often used to estimate the number of fish or other animals in a population moving along a set migration route. a first sample of individuals is captured at one location, marked, and returned to the population. a second sample is then captured farther along the route, and inferences are derived from the numbers of marked and unmarked fish found in this second sample. data from such experiments are often stratified by time (day or week) to allow for possible changes in the capture probabilities, and previous methods of analysis fail to take advantage of the temporal relationships in the stratified data. we present a bayesian, semiparametric method that explicitly models the expected number of fish in each stratum as a smooth function of time. results from the analysis of historical data from the migration of young atlantic salmon (salmo salar) along the conne river, newfoundland, and from a simulation study indicate that the new method provides more precise estimates of the population size and more accurate estimates of uncertainty than the currently available methods."

estimating survival in photographic capture-recapture studies: overcoming misidentification error,accuracy; bias; capture-recapture; connochaetes taurinus; cormack-jolly-seber; open-population models; photographic identification; precision; survival; wildebeest,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MORRISON TA;YOSHIZAKI J;NICHOLS JD;BOLGER DT,"1. for many species, noninvasive photographic identification offers a powerful and costeffective method for estimating demographic parameters and testing ecological hypotheses in large populations. however, this technique is prone to misidentification errors that can severely bias capturerecapture estimates. 2. we present a simple ad hoc data conditioning technique that minimizes bias in survival estimates across all rates of misidentification. we use simulated data sets to characterize trade-offs in bias, precision and accuracy of survival estimators for a range of misidentification probabilities, sampling intensities, survival rates and population sizes using this conditional approach. 3. misidentification errors resulted in mean survival estimates that were negatively biased by as much as -24.9% when errors were ignored. applying the conditional approach resulted in very low levels of bias across parameter space. however, the main cost of conditioning is a loss of precision, which was particularly severe at low sampling intensities. overall, the conditional approach was superior to the nonconditional approach [in terms of root mean square error (rmse) of survival estimates] in 51% of the parameter combinations that we explored. 4. we apply the data conditioning technique to a 3-sample capture-recapture data set compiled from 2551 images of a migratory wildebeest, connochaetes taurinus, population in northern tanzania. we estimate the false rejection rate (i.e., the probability of failing to match two photographs of the same individual) using a test set of ` known-identity'individuals. with this information, we compare survival estimates derived from conditioned data ((phi) over cap = 0.698 +/- 0.176), unconditioned data ((phi) over cap = 0.706 +/- 0.121) and simulated data to illustrate some of the key considerations for deciding whether to apply a conditional approach to a photographic data set. 5. these analyses demonstrate that ignoring misidentification error can lead to substantial bias in survival estimates. when sampling intensity and misclassification error rates are both relatively high, use of our conditioned data approach is preferred and yields survival estimates with lower rmse. however, when sampling intensity and misclassification error are both small, the standard approach using unconditioned data yields smaller rmse."
testing the effectiveness of capture mark recapture population estimation techniques using a computer simulation with known population size,capture-mark-recapture; population; simulation; small mammal,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,REES SG;GOODENOUGH AE;HART AG;STAFFORD R,"estimation of small mammal population sizes is important for monitoring ecosystem condition and for conservation. here, we test the accuracy of standard methods of population size estimation using capture-mark-recapture (cmr) on a simulated population of agents. the use of a computer simulation allows complete control of population sizes and behaviors, thereby avoiding assumptions that may be violated in real populations. we find that the recommended protocol for cmr sampling, using uniformly distributed traps, consistently overestimates population sizes by as much as 100% when studies are conducted over only two trapping periods. more than 20 trapping periods are required before this method, or that of placing traps randomly, gives an accurate estimation of population size (i.e., within a 95% confidence limit of the actual value). non-random sampling, by placing traps on runways used by small mammals, produces the most accurate, and least variable, estimates of population. however, we show that around 10 trapping periods are still required to produce an accurate population estimate using this method. given that most real populations do not comply with the 'ideal' assumptions made by cmr, we suggest that population estimates based on cmr may be fundamentally flawed, and recommend that protocols for cmr population estimation methods may need revising.

a new method for estimating animal abundance with two sources of data in capture-recapture studies,abundance; humpback whales; joint modelling; jolly-seber model; open population; two-source jolly-seber model,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MADON B;GIMENEZ O;MCARDLE B;BAKER CS;GARRIGUE C,"1. mark-recapture studies are often used to estimate population size based on a single source of individual identification data such as natural markings or artificial tags. however, with the development of molecular ecology, multiple sources of identification can be obtained for some species and combining them to obtain population size estimates would certainly provide better information about abundance than each survey can provide alone. 2. we propose an extension of the jolly-seber model to infer abundance by combining two sources of capture-recapture data. the need to merge both sources of data was motivated by studies of humpback whales in which both photo-identification and dna from skin biopsy samples are often collected. as whales are not necessarily available by both sampling methods on any given occasion, they can appear twice in the combined data set if no combined sampling ever occurred during the survey, i.e. being photographed and genotyped on the same occasion. our model thus combines the two sources of information by estimating the possible overlap. monte carlo simulations are used to assess the properties of the present estimator that is then used to estimate the size of the humpback whale population in new caledonia. the new open-population estimator is also compared with classic closed-population estimators incorporating either temporal and/or individual heterogeneity in the capture probability: the purpose was to evaluate which approach (closed or open population) was the least biased for an open population with individual heterogeneous capture probabilities. 3. when all assumptions are met, the estimator is unbiased as long as the probability of being double-tagged (e. g. photographed and biopsied on the same occasion) on every occasion is above 0 2. 4. the humpback whale case study in new caledonia shows that our two-source jolly-seber (tsjs) estimator could be more efficient in estimating population size than models based only on one type of data. for monitoring purposes, the proposed method provides an efficient alternative to the existing approaches and a productive direction for future work to deal with multiple sources of data to estimate abundance. 5. r-codes formatting the data and implementing the tsjs model are provided in resource s5."
theory put into practice: an r implementation of the infinite-dimensional model,evolution; function valued trait; infinite-dimensional model; growth trajectory; phenotypic variation; selection,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,KUPARINEN A;BYORKLUND M,"the infinite dimensional model (idm) is an approach that has been developed for the analyses of phenotypic variation in function valued traits such as growth trajectories and continuous reaction norms. this model is particularly suited for the analysis of the potential and the constraints for growth to evolve under selection on body size. despite of its applicability to a broad range of study systems idm has only been applied in a handful of studies, as it is mathematically demanding for scientists not familiar with quantitative genetics methods. here, we present a user-friendly r implementation of idm, demonstrate its performance with growth data on nine-spined stickleback (pungitius pungitius). in addition to rearing experiments, individual based size-at-age trajectories are often measured in wild in mark-recapture studies or estimated retrospectively from scales or bones. therefore, our r implementation of idm should be applicable to many studies conducted in wild and in a lab, and be useful by making the methodologically challenging idm approach more easily accessible also in the fields where quantitative genetics methods are less standardly used.

population size estimation based upon ratios of recapture probabilities,chao-bunge estimator; katz distribution; species problem; negative binomial distribution; weighted linear regression; zero-truncation,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,ROCCHETTI I;BUNGE J;BOHNING D,"estimating the size of an elusive target population is of prominent interest in many areas in the life and social sciences. our aim is to provide an efficient and workable method to estimate the unknown population size, given the frequency distribution of counts of repeated identifications of units of the population of interest. this counting variable is necessarily zero-truncated, since units that have never been identified are not in the sample. we consider several applications: clinical medicine, where interest is in estimating patients with adenomatous polyps which have been overlooked by the diagnostic procedure; drug user studies, where interest is in estimating the number of hidden drug users which are not identified; veterinary surveillance of scrapie in the uk, where interest is in estimating the hidden amount of scrapie; and entomology and microbial ecology, where interest is in estimating the number of unobserved species of organisms. in all these examples, simple models such as the homogenous poisson are not appropriate since they do not account for present and latent heterogeneity. the poisson-gamma (negative binomial) model provides a flexible alternative and often leads to well-fitting models. it has a long history and was recently used in the development of the chao-bunge estimator. here we use a different property of the poisson-gamma model: if we consider ratios of neighboring poisson-gamma probabilities, then these are linearly related to the counts of repeated identifications. also, ratios have the useful property that they are identical for truncated and untruncated distributions. in this paper we propose a weighted logarithmic regression model to estimate the zero frequency counts, assuming a gamma-poisson distribution for the counts. a detailed explanation about the chosen weights and a goodness of fit index are presented, along with extensions to other distributions. to evaluate the proposed estimator, we applied it to the benchmark examples mentioned above, and we compared the results with those obtained through the chao-bunge and other estimators. the major benefits of the proposed estimator are that it is defined under mild conditions, whereas the chao-bunge estimator fails to be well defined in several of the examples presented; in cases where the chao-bunge estimator is defined, its behavior is comparable to the proposed estimator in terms of bias and mse as a simulation study shows. furthermore, the proposed estimator is relatively insensitive to inclusion or exclusion of large outlying frequencies, while sensitivity to outliers is characteristic of most other methods. the implications and limitations of such methods are discussed."
full open population capture-recapture models with individual covariates,capture-recapture; demographic parameters; hierarchical modeling; individual covariates; jags/bugs,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,SCHOFIELD MR;BARKER RJ,"traditional analyses of capture-recapture data are based on likelihood functions that explicitly integrate out all missing data. we use a complete data likelihood (cdl) to show how a wide range of capture-recapture models can be easily fitted using readily available software jags/bugs even when there are individual-specific time-varying covariates. the models we describe extend those that condition on first capture to include abundance parameters, or parameters related to abundance, such as population size, birth rates or lifetime. the use of a cdl means that any missing data, including uncertain individual covariates, can be included in models without the need for customized likelihood functions. this approach also facilitates modeling processes of demographic interest rather than the complexities caused by non-ignorable missing data. we illustrate using two examples, (i) open population modeling in the presence of a censored time-varying individual covariate in a full robust design, and (ii) full open population multi-state modeling in the presence of a partially observed categorical variable. supplemental materials for this article are available online."
estimating demographic parameters for capture-recapture data in the presence of multiple mark types,mark-recapture; mark-loss; halichoerus grypus; multiple mark types; integrated analysis,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,SMOUT S;KING R;POMEROY P,"in mark-recapture studies, various techniques can be used to uniquely identify individual animals, such as ringing, tagging or photo-identification using natural markings. in some long-term studies more than one type of marking procedure may be implemented during the study period. in these circumstances, ignoring the different mark types can produce biased survival estimates since the assumption that the different mark types are equally catchable (homogeneous capture probability across mark types) may be incorrect. we implement an integrated approach where we simultaneously analyse data obtained using three different marking techniques, assuming that animals can be cross-classified across the different mark types. we discriminate between competing models using the aic statistic. this technique also allows us to estimate both relative mark-loss probabilities and relative recapture efficiency rates for the different marking methods. we initially perform a simulation study to explore the different biases that can be introduced if we assume a homogeneous recapture probability over mark type, before applying the method to a real dataset. we make use of data obtained from an intensive long-term observational study of uk female grey seals (halichoerus grypus) at a single breeding colony, where three different methods are used to identify individuals within a single study: branding, tagging and photo-identification based on seal coat pattern or pelage."
a hierarchical bayesian approach to record linkage and population size problems,capture-recapture methods; conditional independence; gibbs sampling; metropolis-hastings; record linkage,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,TANCREDI A;LISEO B,"we propose and illustrate a hierarchical bayesian approach for matching statistical records observed on different occasions. we show how this model can be profitably adopted both in record linkage problems and in capture-recapture setups, where the size of a finite population is the real object of interest. there are at least two important differences between the proposed model-based approach and the current practice in record linkage. first, the statistical model is built up on the actually observed categorical variables and no reduction (to 0-1 comparisons) of the available information takes place. second, the hierarchical structure of the model allows a two-way propagation of the uncertainty between the parameter estimation step and the matching procedure so that no plug-in estimates are used and the correct uncertainty is accounted for both in estimating the population size and in performing the record linkage. we illustrate and motivate our proposal through a real data example and simulations."
a new method for estimating growth transition matrices,growth; length-based models; mark-recapture; transition matrices,BIOMETRICS,HILLARY RM,the vast majority of population models work using age or stage not length but there are many cases where animals cannot be aged sensibly or accurately. for these cases length-based models form the logical alternative but there has been little work done to develop and compare different methods of estimating growth transition matrices to be used in such models. this article demonstrates how a consistent bayesian framework for estimating growth parameters and a novel method for constructing length transition matrices accounts for variation in growth in a clear and consistent manner and avoids potential subjective choices required using more established methods. the inclusion of the resultant growth uncertainty in population assessment models and the potential impact on management decisions is also addressed.
multistate mark-recapture model selection using score tests,branta canadensis; canada goose; mark-recapture; memory model; model selection,BIOMETRICS,MCCREA RS;MORGAN BJT,"although multistate mark-recapture models are recognized as important, they lack a simple model-selection procedure. this article proposes and evaluates a step-up approach to select appropriate models for multistate mark-recapture data using score tests. only models supported by the data require fitting, so that over-complicated model structures with too many parameters do not need to be considered. typically only a small number of models are fitted, and the procedure is also able to identify parameter-redundant and near-redundant models. the good performance of the technique is demonstrated using simulation, and the approach is illustrated on a three-region canada goose data set. in this case, it identifies a new model that is much simpler than the best model previously considered for this application."
capture-recapture smooth estimation of age-specific survival probabilities in animal populations,k-fold cross-validation; generalized cross-validation; penalized likelihood; senescence; age-structured populations,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,VIALLEFONT A,"yielding sound estimates of survival according to age in wild populations where senescence or other age-related variations may occur is very important to management decision makers, and remains challenging. this paper proposes to use penalized maximum likelihood to obtain smooth estimates of annual survival probabilities across age in populations of wild animals followed by capture-recapture. we propose to use two different types of smoothing penalties, and we use nu-fold cross-validation to select the best value of the tuning parameter for the intensity of smoothing. we then assess the accuracy of the method by a simulation study with two different shapes of the relationship between age and survival, and we conclude that a careful use of this method provides reliable noise-free estimates of age-specific annual survival. we apply this procedure to the motivating data from a population of roe deer known to exhibit a marked decrease of survival with age, and we compare our results with those previously published on this population."
modeling misidentification errors that result from use of genetic tags in capture-recapture studies,closed population models; genotype; population size estimate; natural tags; photographic identification; misidentification,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,YOSHIZAKI J;BROWNIE C;POLLOCK KH;LINK WA,"misidentification of animals is potentially important when naturally existing features (natural tags) such as dna fingerprints (genetic tags) are used to identify individual animals. for example, when misidentification leads to multiple identities being assigned to an animal, traditional estimators tend to overestimate population size. accounting for misidentification in capture-recapture models requires detailed understanding of the mechanism. using genetic tags as an example, we outline a framework for modeling the effect of misidentification in closed population studies when individual identification is based on natural tags that are consistent over time (non-evolving natural tags). we first assume a single sample is obtained per animal for each capture event, and then generalize to the case where multiple samples (such as hair or scat samples) are collected per animal per capture occasion. we introduce methods for estimating population size and, using a simulation study, we show that our new estimators perform well for cases with moderately high capture probabilities or high misidentification rates. in contrast, conventional estimators can seriously overestimate population size when errors due to misidentification are ignored."
"a capture-recapture model with double-marking, live and dead encounters, and heterogeneity of reporting due to auxiliary mark loss",e-surge; mixture of information; multi-event; recoveries; tag loss,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,JUILLET C;CHOQUET R;GAUTHIER G;PRADEL R,"capture-recapture (cr) models assume marked individuals remain at risk of capture, which may not be true if individuals lose their mark or emigrate definitively from the study area. using a double-marking protocol, with a main and auxiliary mark, and both live encounters and dead recoveries at a large scale, partially frees cr models from this assumption. however, the auxiliary mark may fall off and its presence is often not mentioned when dead individuals are reported. we propose a new model to deal with heterogeneity of detection and uncertainty of the presence of an auxiliary mark in a multi-event framework. our general model, based on a double-marking protocol, uses information from physical captures/recaptures, distant observations and main mark recoveries from dead animals. we applied our model to a 13-year data set of a harvested species, the greater snow goose. we obtained seasonal survival estimates for adults of both sexes. survival estimates differed between models where the presence of the auxiliary mark upon recovery was ignored versus those where the presence was accounted for. in the multi-event framework, seasonal survival estimates are no longer biased because the heterogeneity due to the presence of an auxiliary mark is accounted for in the estimation of recovery rates. note: an illustration of the implementation of our model in e-surge is available online."

continuous covariates in mark-recapture-recovery analysis: a comparison of methods,bayesian inference; imputation; individual covariates; mark-recapture-recovery; missing covariates; time-varying continuous covariates; trinomial model,BIOMETRICS,BONNER SJ;MORGAN BJT;KING R,"p>time varying, individual covariates are problematic in experiments with marked animals because the covariate can typically only be observed when each animal is captured. we examine three methods to incorporate time varying, individual covariates of the survival probabilities into the analysis of data from mark-recapture-recovery experiments: deterministic imputation, a bayesian imputation approach based on modeling the joint distribution of the covariate and the capture history, and a conditional approach considering only the events for which the associated covariate data are completely observed (the trinomial model). after describing the three methods, we compare results from their application to the analysis of the effect of body mass on the survival of soay sheep (ovis aries) on the isle of hirta, scotland. simulations based on these results are then used to make further comparisons. we conclude that both the trinomial model and bayesian imputation method perform best in different situations. if the capture and recovery probabilities are all high, then the trinomial model produces precise, unbiased estimators that do not depend on any assumptions regarding the distribution of the covariate. in contrast, the bayesian imputation method performs substantially better when capture and recovery probabilities are low, provided that the specified model of the covariate is a good approximation to the true data-generating mechanism."

bayesian analysis of abundance for binomial sighting data with unknown number of marked individuals,individual heterogeneity; mark-resight; marking and sighting; markov chain monte carlo; population size,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,MCCLINTOCK BT;HOETING JA,"the mark-resight method for estimating the size of a closed population can in many circumstances be a less expensive and less invasive alternative to traditional mark-recapture. despite its potential advantages, one major drawback of traditional mark-resight methodology is that the number of marked individuals in the population available for resighting needs to be known exactly. in real field studies, this can be quite difficult to accomplish. here we develop a bayesian model for estimating abundance when sighting data are acquired from distinct sampling occasions without replacement, but the exact number of marked individuals is unknown. by first augmenting the data with some fixed number of individuals comprising a marked ""super population,"" the problem may then be reformulated in terms of estimating the proportion of this marked super population that was actually available for resighting. this then allows the data for the marked population available for resighting to be modeled as random realizations from a binomial logit-normal distribution. we demonstrate the use of our model to estimate the new zealand robin (petroica australis) population size in a region of fiordland national park, new zealand. we then evaluate the performance of the proposed model relative to other estimators via a series of simulation experiments. we generally found our model to have advantages over other models when sample sizes are smaller with individually heterogeneous resighting probabilities. due to limited budgets and the inherent variability between individuals, this is a common occurrence in mark-resight population studies. winbugs and r code to carry out these analyses is available from http://www.stat.colostate.edu/similar to jah/software."

improving estimates of abundance by aggregating sparse capture-recapture data,abundance estimation; data aggregation; mark-recapture; program capture; program mark; population parameters,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,LITT AR;STEIDL RJ,"inferences about abundance often are based on unadjusted counts of individuals observed, in part, because of the large amount of data required to generate reliable estimates of abundance. where capture-recapture data are sparse, aggregating data across multiple sample elements by pooling species, locations, and sampling periods increases the information available for modeling detection probability, a necessary step for estimating abundance reliably. the process of aggregating sample elements involves balancing trade-offs related to the number of aggregated elements; although larger aggregates increase the amount of information available for estimation, they often require more complex models. we describe a heuristic approach for aggregating data for studies with multiple sample elements, use simulated data to evaluate the efficacy of aggregation, and illustrate the approach using data from a field study. aggregating data systematically improved reliability of model selection and increased accuracy of abundance estimates while still providing estimates of abundance for each original sample unit, an important benefit necessary to maintain the design and sampling structure of a study. within the framework of capture-recapture sampling, aggregating data improves estimates of abundance and increases the reliability of subsequent inferences made from sparse data. additional tables and datasets may be found in the online supplements."

unbiased survival estimates and evidence for skipped breeding opportunities in females,boreal toad; capture-recapture; colorado; multi-state open robust design; survival; temporary emigration,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MUTHS E;SCHERER RD;LAMBERT BA,"1. estimates of demographic parameters for females, in many organisms, are sparse. this is particularly worrisome as more and more species are faced with high extinction probabilities and conservation increasingly depends on actions dictated by complex predictive models that require accurate estimates of demographic parameters for each sex and species. 2. this study assesses demographic parameters, specifically temporary emigration and survival, for females, a class that has been difficult to investigate historically because of lack of data. amphibians provide a particularly good example because there is global concern about amphibian decline; yet most demographic parameter estimates are based on data from males, which we show can lead to erroneous conclusions. 3. we use 10 years of capture-recapture data from boreal toads (bufo boreas) and the multi-state open robust design model to provide evidence for the occurrence of skipped breeding opportunities (i.e. temporary emigration) in females. this is the first time that the open robust design model has been applied to an analysis of an amphibian population that we are aware of. 4. we determined that the transition from breeder to non-breeder is obligate and the probability of a non-breeder remaining a non-breeder is 64%; thus, temporary emigration is first-order markovian in nature, where breeding probability is dependent on the previous year's activity, i.e. if a female did not breed in year one, there is a 36% chance that she will breed in year two. with temporary emigration accounted for, we estimated between-year female survival at 87%. 5. establishing the occurrence of temporary emigration not only reduces bias in estimates of survival probabilities but also provides information about expected breeding attempts by females, a critical element in understanding the ecology of an organism and the impacts of outside stressors and conservation actions."
a primer on the application of markov chains to the study of wildlife disease dynamics,epidemiological model; house finch carpodacus mexicanus; markov process; mycoplasma gallisepticum; wildlife disease,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ZIPKIN EF;JENNELLE CS;COOCH EG,"1. for wildlife researchers, disease specialists and policy analysts unfamiliar with the mathematical/statistical language of disease models, translation of probability statements into meaningful terms for disease research and control may be challenging. markov chain models are powerful tools, applicable to the study of disease dynamics that allow straightforward calculations of easily interpretable metrics of interest including probabilities of infection/recovery, expected times to initial infection, duration of illness and life expectancies for susceptible and infected individuals. 2. we present the basic principles and assumptions behind markov chain modelling with an intuitive interpretation of parameter estimates and a step-by-step guide (including software code) for implementing this approach in the study of wildlife diseases. we also include an explanation of the estimation process necessary to implement markov chain modelling (i.e. estimating the probability of state transitions between consecutive time steps) from typical survey data. 3. we demonstrate the usefulness and ease of calculation of markov chains through an example using a house finch carpodacus mexicanus-mycoplasma gallisepticum (mg) system. our results show how semi-weekly transition estimates of susceptible and infected individuals can be used to estimate a wide array of seasonal disease-associated metrics. 4. markov chain modelling can provide a basic understanding of parameters estimated from wildlife disease studies, and can aid in understanding the implications of disease on wildlife populations and in evaluation of control measures. we envision this paper serving as an entry point into the extensive literature and potential applications of markov chains in epidemiological modelling."
double-observer line transect methods: levels of independence,distance sampling; double-observer methods; full independence; limiting independence; line transect sampling; point independence,BIOMETRICS,BUCKLAND ST;LAAKE JL;BORCHERS DL,"p>double-observer line transect methods are becoming increasingly widespread, especially for the estimation of marine mammal abundance from aerial and shipboard surveys when detection of animals on the line is uncertain. the resulting data supplement conventional distance sampling data with two-sample mark-recapture data. like conventional mark-recapture data, these have inherent problems for estimating abundance in the presence of heterogeneity. unlike conventional mark-recapture methods, line transect methods use knowledge of the distribution of a covariate, which affects detection probability (namely, distance from the transect line) in inference. this knowledge can be used to diagnose unmodeled heterogeneity in the mark-recapture component of the data. by modeling the covariance in detection probabilities with distance, we show how the estimation problem can be formulated in terms of different levels of independence. at one extreme, full independence is assumed, as in the petersen estimator (which does not use distance data); at the other extreme, independence only occurs in the limit as detection probability tends to one. between the two extremes, there is a range of models, including those currently in common use, which have intermediate levels of independence. we show how this framework can be used to provide more reliable analysis of double-observer line transect data. we test the methods by simulation, and by analysis of a dataset for which true abundance is known. we illustrate the approach through analysis of minke whale sightings data from the north sea and adjacent waters."
uncovering a latent multinomial: analysis of mark-recapture data with misidentification,dna fingerprints; mark-recapture; misidentification; multinomial; natural tags; null space,BIOMETRICS,LINK WA;YOSHIZAKI J;BAILEY LL;POLLOCK KH,"natural tags based on dna fingerprints or natural features of animals are now becoming very widely used in wildlife population biology. however, classic capture-recapture models do not allow for misidentification of animals which is a potentially very serious problem with natural tags. statistical analysis of misidentification processes is extremely difficult using traditional likelihood methods but is easily handled using bayesian methods. we present a general framework for bayesian analysis of categorical data arising from a latent multinomial distribution. although our work is motivated by a specific model for misidentification in closed population capture-recapture analyses, with crucial assumptions which may not always be appropriate, the methods we develop extend naturally to a variety of other models with similar structure. suppose that observed frequencies f are a known linear transformation f = a'x of a latent multinomial variable x with cell probability vector pi = pi(theta). given that full conditional distributions [theta vertical bar x] can be sampled, implementation of gibbs sampling requires only that we can sample from the full conditional distribution [x vertical bar f, theta], which is made possible by knowledge of the null space of a'. we illustrate the approach using two data sets with individual misidentification, one simulated, the other summarizing recapture data for salamanders based on natural marks."

population estimates from aerial photographic surveys of naturally and variably marked bowhead whales,abundance; bootstrap; capture-recapture; confidence curve; event history; false negatives; photo-identification,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,SCHWEDER T;SADYKOVA D;RUGH D;KOSKI W,"abundance, mortality, and population growth of bowhead whales (balaena mysticetus) are estimated from captures of 4,894 putatively different individuals obtained from 10 years of systematic photographic surveys conducted during the spring migration when most of the bering-chukchi-beaufort population of bowheads migrates past point barrow, alaska. a stringent matching protocol designed to prevent false positive matches of the naturally, but variably marked individuals, led to 42 resightings between years. the flip side of this stringency is a presence of false negatives, i.e., some true recaptures are not recognized as such. the problem of false negatives is addressed by modeling the capture process and the matching process. the captures of an individual are assumed to follow a poisson process with intensity depending stochastically on the individual whale and on the year. the probability of successfully matching a capture to a previous capture is estimated by logistic regression on the degree of marking and image quality. individuals are recruited by the pella-tomlinson population model, and their mortality rate is assumed to be constant. the point estimate of yearly growth rate is 3.2%, and bowhead abundance in 2001 is estimated to be 8,250, similar to previous estimates."
an integrated population model from constant effort bird-ringing data,bayesian approach; capture-recapture; constant effort sites scheme; emigration; sedge warbler acrocephalus schoenobaenus; transients,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,CAVE VM;KING R;FREEMAN SN,"data from annual bird-ringing programs, in which catch effort is standardized, are routinely used to index abundance, productivity, and adult survival. efficient models have been developed for each. such monitoring schemes, based on ringing across a number of sites, are perhaps unique in providing this combination of demographic information and make the data particularly amenable to an integrated approach to population modeling. we develop a bayesian approach and a deterministic population model uniting abundance, productivity, and survival. the method is applied to sedge warbler acrocephalus schoenobaenus data from the british trust for ornithology's constant effort sites scheme. the possibility of ""transient"" birds needs to be incorporated within this analysis. we demonstrate how current methodology can efficiently be extended to use additional data from multiple within year recaptures when controlling for transience. supplemental materials for this article are available online."
using multistate mark-recapture methods to model adult salmonid migration in an industrialized river,chinook salmon; memory effects; multistate model; radiotelemetry; release-recapture,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,BUCHANAN RA;SKALSKI JR,"a multistate mark-recapture (msmr) model of the adult salmonid migration through the lower columbia river and into the snake river was developed, designed for radiotelemetry detections at dams and tributary mouths. the model focuses on upstream-directed travel, with states determined from observed fish movement patterns indicating directed upstream travel, downstream travel (fallback), and use of non-natal tributaries. the model was used to analyze telemetry data from 846 migrating adult spring-summer chinook salmon (oncorhynchus tshawytscha) tagged in 1996 at bonneville dam on the columbia river. we used the model to test competing hypotheses regarding delayed effects of fallback at dams and visits to tributaries, and to define and estimate migration summary measures. tagged fish had an average probability of 0.755 ((se) over cap = 0.018) of ending migration at a tributary or upstream of lower granite dam on the snake river, and a probability of 0.245 ((se) over cap = 0.018) of unaccountable loss (i.e., mortality or mainstem spawning) between the release site downstream of bonneville dam and lower granite dam. the highest probability of unaccountable loss (0.092; (se) over cap = 0.012) was in the reach between bonneville dam and the dalles dam. study fish used the tributaries primarily as exits from the hydrosystem, and visits to non-natal tributaries had no significant effect on subsequent movement upriver (p = 0.4245). however, fallback behavior had a small effect on subsequent tributary entry and exit (p = 0.0530), with fish using tributaries as resting areas after reascending bonneville dam after fallback. the spatial msmr model developed here can be adapted to address additional questions about the interaction of migrating organisms with their environment. or for the study of migrations in other river systems.

measuring and modeling the seasonal changes of an urban green treefrog (hyla cinerea) population,anuran population; capture-mark-recapture; statistical population estimates; stage structured model; model-to-data fits; extinction probability; intra-annual fluctuations,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,ACKLEH AS;CARTER J;COLE L;NGUYEN T;MONTE J;PETTIT C,"green treefrogs (hyla cinerea) were captured, marked, measured and released at an urban study site in lafayette, la, during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. a statistical method based on a generalization of the hypergeometric distribution was used to derive weekly time-series estimates of the population sizes. to describe the population dynamics, a stage structured mathematical model was developed and compared to time-series obtained from the weekly population estimates study using a least-squares approach. two fitting experiments were done: (1) using uniform distribution for the birth rate during the breeding season; (2) using a birth rate distributed according to weekly data on frog calling intensity. although both model-to-data fits look very promising during the years 2004 and 2005 and result in similar inherent survivorship rates for the tadpoles, juvenile and adult frogs, the fit that uses the calling data predicts a lower number of tadpoles and frogs in the long term than the one that uses uniform birth distribution. the parameter estimates resulting from these fitting experiments are used in the context of stochastic simulations to derive extinction and persistence probabilities for this population. due to the oscillatory dynamics (with high amplitude) evidenced by the capture-recapture data and corroborated by the model, it is suggested that anuran monitoring efforts should take into account the natural intra-annual variation in population size.

comparing species assemblages via species accumulation curves,binomial mixtures; species richness,BIOMETRICS,MAO CX;LI J,"p>comparing species assemblages given incidence-based data is of importance in ecological studies, often done by a visual inspection of estimated species accumulation curves or by an ad hoc use of 95% pointwise confidence bands of these curves. it is shown that comparing species assemblages is a challenging problem. a chi 2 test is proposed. an adjustment using an eigenvalue decomposition is proposed to overcome computational difficulties. the bootstrap method is also suggested to approximate the distribution of the proposed test statistic. the eigenvalue adjusted (eva) chi 2 test and the eva-bootstrap test are assessed by a simulation study. both the eva-chi 2 and the eva-bootstrap tests are applied to a study that involves two woody seedling species assemblages."
integrated data analysis in the presence of emigration and mark loss,bayesian inference; combined data; common guillemot (uria aalge); markov chain monte carlo (mcmc); population dynamics; state-space model,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,REYNOLDS TJ;KING R;HARWOOD J;FREDERIKSEN M;HARRIS MP;WANLESS S,"integrated data analyses are becoming increasingly common in studies of wild animal populations where two or more separate sources of data contain information about common parameters. these types of analyses provide robust parameter estimates which fully reflect all available information, as well as estimates of parameters that would be unidentifiable in a separate analysis. in this article we present an integrated bayesian analysis of four long-term datasets (counts, two mark-recapture-recovery time series, and productivity) relating to a colony of common guillemots (uria aalge) on the isle of may, southeast scotland. a complication when considering the dynamics of populations of this kind is the unobservable emigration of immature animals. in the analysis of mark-recapture-recovery data, the rate of emigration is frequently confounded with that of mark loss and it is only possible to estimate the product of these parameters. by combining all available data for the isle of may guillemots in an integrated population model, we are able to estimate these parameters separately and thus obtain improved estimates of prerecruitment emigration."
a nonparametric lower bound for the number of species shared by multiple communities,abundance data; community overlap; diversity indices; replicated incidence data; shared species; similarity,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS,PAN HY;CHAO A;FOISSNER W,"in biological and ecological statistical inference, it is practically useful to provide a lower bound for species richness in a community. chao (1984, 1989) derived a non-parametric lower bound for species richness in a single community. however, there have been no lower bounds proposed in the literature for the number of species shared by multiple communities. based on sample species abundance or replicated incidence records from each of the n communities, we derive in this article a nonparametric approach to constructing a lower bound for the number of species shared by n (n >= 2) communities. the approach is valid for all types of species abundance distributions (for abundance data) or species detection probabilities (for replicated incidence data). variance estimators for the proposed lower bounds are obtained by using typical asymptotic theory. simulation results are reported to examine the performance of the lower bounds. replicated incidence data of ciliate species collected in three areas from namibia, southwest africa, are used for illustration. we also briefly discuss the application of the proposed method to estimate the size of a shared population (i.e., the number of individuals in the intersection of multiple populations) based on capture-recapture data from each population."
incorporating genotype uncertainty into mark-recapture-type models for estimating abundance using dna samples,allelic dropout; bayesian inference; mark recapture; markov chain monte carlo; microsatellite; noninvasive genetic sampling; population estimation,BIOMETRICS,WRIGHT JA;BARKER RJ;SCHOFIELD MR;FRANTZ AC;BYROM AE;GLEESON DM,"p>sampling dna noninvasively has advantages for identifying animals for uses such as mark-recapture modeling that require unique identification of animals in samples. although it is possible to generate large amounts of data from noninvasive sources of dna, a challenge is overcoming genotyping errors that can lead to incorrect identification of individuals. a major source of error is allelic dropout, which is failure of dna amplification at one or more loci. this has the effect of heterozygous individuals being scored as homozygotes at those loci as only one allele is detected. if errors go undetected and the genotypes are naively used in mark-recapture models, significant overestimates of population size can occur. to avoid this it is common to reject low-quality samples but this may lead to the elimination of large amounts of data. it is preferable to retain these low-quality samples as they still contain usable information in the form of partial genotypes. rather than trying to minimize error or discarding error-prone samples we model dropout in our analysis. we describe a method based on data augmentation that allows us to model data from samples that include uncertain genotypes. application is illustrated using data from the european badger (meles meles)."
a multilevel model for continuous time population estimation,closed population; continuous time; hierarchical model; population estimation,BIOMETRICS,SUTHERLAND JM;CASTELLUCCIO P;SCHWARZ CJ,"p>statistical methods have been developed and applied to estimating populations that are difficult or too costly to enumerate. known as multilist methods in epidemiological settings, individuals are matched across lists and estimation of population size proceeds by modeling counts in incomplete multidimensional contingency tables (based on patterns of presence/absence on lists). as multilist methods typically assume that lists are compiled instantaneously, there are few options available for estimating the unknown size of a closed population based on continuously (longitudinally) compiled lists. however, in epidemiological settings, continuous time lists are a routine byproduct of administrative functions. existing methods are based on time-to-event analyses with a second step of estimating population size. we propose an alternative approach to address the twofold epidemiological problem of estimating population size and of identifying patient factors related to duration (in days) between visits to a health care facility. a bayesian framework is proposed to model interval lengths because, for many patients, the data are sparse; many patients were observed only once or twice. the proposed method is applied to the motivating data to illustrate the methods' applicability. then, a small simulation study explores the performance of the estimator under a variety of conditions. finally, a small discussion section suggests opportunities for continued methodological development for continuous time population estimation."
flexible hierarchical mark-recapture modeling for open populations using winbugs,bayesian; hierarchical modeling; winbugs,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,SCHOFIELD MR;BARKER RJ;MACKENZIE DI,"hierarchical mark-recapture models offer three advantages over classical mark-recapture models: (i) they allow expression of complicated models in terms of simple components; (ii) they provide a convenient way of modeling missing data and latent variables in a way that allows expression of relationships involving latent variables in the model; (iii) they provide a convenient way of introducing parsimony into models involving many nuisance parameters. expressing models using the complete data likelihood we show how many of the standard mark-recapture models for open populations can be readily fitted using the software winbugs. we include examples that illustrate fitting the cormack-jolly-seber model, multi-state and multi-event models, models including auxiliary data, and models including density dependence."

modelling dispersal with diffusion and habitat selection: analytical results for highly fragmented landscapes,dispersal; random walk; edge-mediate behavior; diffusion model; conditional occupancy times; metapopulation,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,ZHENG CZ;PENNANEN J;OVASKAINEN O,"quantifying dispersal is crucial both for understanding ecological population dynamics, and for gaining insight into factors that affect the genetic structure of populations. the role of dispersal becomes pronounced in highly fragmented landscapes inhabited by spatially structured populations. we consider a landscape consisting of a set of habitat patches surrounded by unsuitable matrix, and model dispersal by assuming that the individuals follow a random walk with parameters that may be specific to the habitat type. we allow for spatial variation in patch quality, and account for edge-mediated behavior, the latter meaning that the individuals bias their movement towards the patches when close to an edge between a patch and the matrix. we employ a diffusion approximation of the random walk model to derive analytical expressions for various characteristics of the dispersal process. for example, we derive formulae for the time that an individual is expected to spend in its current patch i, and for the time that it will spend in the matrix, both conditional on the individual hitting next a given patch j before hitting any of the other patches or dying. the analytical formulae are based on the assumptions that the landscape is infinitely large, that the patches are circularly shaped, and that the patches are small compared to interpatch distances. we evaluate the effect of these assumptions by comparing the analytical results to numerical results in a real patch network that violates all of the three assumptions. we then consider a landscape that fulfills the assumptions, and show that in this case the analytical results are in a very good agreement with the numerical results. the results obtained here allow the construction of computationally efficient dispersal models that can be used as components of metapopulation models.

modelling predation by transient leopard seals for an ecosystem-based management of southern ocean fisheries,bioenergetics; data augmentation; dispersal; food consumption; hydrurga leptonyx; mark-recapture; mcmc; prey choice; state-space model; sub-antarctic,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,FORCADA J;MALONE D;ROYLE JA;STANILAND IJ,"correctly quantifying the impacts of rare apex marine predators is essential to ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, where harvesting must be sustainable for targeted species and their dependent predators. this requires modelling the uncertainty in such processes as predator life history, seasonal abundance and movement, size-based predation, energetic requirements, and prey vulnerability. we combined these uncertainties to evaluate the predatory impact of transient leopard seals on a community of mesopredators (seals and penguins) and their prey at south georgia, and assess the implications for an ecosystem-based management. the mesopredators are highly dependent on antarctic krill and icefish, which are targeted by regional fisheries. we used a state-space formulation to combine (1) a mark-recapture open-population model and individual identification data to assess seasonally variable leopard seal arrival and departure dates, numbers, and residency times; (2) a size-based bioenergetic model; and (3) a size-based prey choice model from a diet analysis. our models indicated that prey choice and consumption reflected seasonal changes in leopard seal population size and structure, size-selective predation and prey vulnerability. a population of 104 (90-125) leopard seals, of which 64% were juveniles, consumed less than 2% of the antarctic fur seal pup production of the area (50% of total ingested energy, ie), but ca. 12-16% of the local gentoo penguin population (20% ie). antarctic krill (28% ie) were the only observed food of leopard seal pups and supplemented the diet of older individuals. direct impacts on krill and fish were negligible, but the ""escapement"" due to leopard seal predation on fur seal pups and penguins could be significant for the mackerel icefish fishery at south georgia. these results suggest that: (1) rare apex predators like leopard seals may control, and may depend on, populations of mesopredators dependent on prey species targeted by fisheries: and (2) predatory impacts and community control may vary throughout the predator's geographic range, and differ across ecosystems and management areas, depending on the seasonal abundance of the prey and the predator's dispersal movements. this understanding is important to integrate the predator needs as natural mortality of its prey in models to set prey catch limits for fisheries. reliable estimates of the variability of these needs are essential for a precautionary interpretation in the context of an ecosystem-based management.

a covariate adjustment for zero-truncated approaches to estimating the size of hidden and elusive populations,population size estimation; capture-recapture; estimation under model misspecification; truncated poisson and binomial likelihood; elusive population,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,BOHNING D;VAN DER HEUDEN PGM,"in this paper we consider the estimation of population size from one-source capture-recapture data, that is, a list in which individuals can potentially be found repeatedly and where the question is how many individuals are missed by the list. as a typical example, we provide data from a drug user study in bangkok from 2001 where the list consists of drug users who repeatedly contact treatment institutions. drug users with 1, 2, 3, ... contacts occur, but drug users with zero contacts are not present, requiring the size of this group to be estimated. statistically, these data can be considered as stemming from a zero-truncated count distribution, we revisit an estimator for the population size suggested by zelterman that is known to be robust under potential unobserved heterogeneity. we demonstrate that the zelterman estimator can be viewed as a maximum likelihood estimator for a locally truncated poisson likelihood which is equivalent to a binomial likelihood. this result allows the extension of the zelterman estimator by means of logistic regression to include observed heterogeneity in the form of covariates. we also review ail estimator proposed by chao and explain why we are not able to obtain similar results for this estimator. the zelterman estimator is applied in two case studies, the first a drug user study from bangkok, the second an illegal immigrant study in the netherlands. our results suggest the new estimator should be used, in particular, if substantial unobserved heterogeneity is present."
on comparison of mixture models for closed population capture-recapture studies,bias decomposition; boundary problems; intrinsic bias,BIOMETRICS,MAO CX;YOU N,"a mixture model is a natural choice to deal with individual heterogeneity in capture-recapture studies. pledger (2000, biometrics 56, 434-442; 2005, biometrics 61, 868-876) advertised the use of the two-point mixture model. dorazio and royle (2003, biometrics 59, 351-364; 2005, biometrics 61, 874-876) suggested that the beta-binomial model has advantages. the controversy is related to the nonidentifiability of the population size (ink, 2003, biometrics 59, 1123-1130) and certain boundary problems. the total bias is decomposed into an intrinsic bias, an approximation bias, and an estimation bias. we propose to assess the approximation bias, the estimation bias, and the variance, with the intrinsic bias excluded when comparing different estimators. the boundary problems in both models and their impacts are investigated. real epidemiological and ecological examples are analyzed."

estimating abundance using mark-resight when sampling is with replacement or the number of marked individuals is unknown,bowden's estimator; individual heterogeneity; mark-recapture; population size; prairie dog; program mark; program noremark,BIOMETRICS,MCCLINTOCK BT;WHITE GC;ANTOLIN MF;TRIPP DW,"although mark-resight methods can often be a less expensive and less invasive means for estimating abundance in long-term population monitoring programs, two major limitations of the estimators are that they typically require sampling without replacement and/or the number of marked individuals available for resighting to be known exactly. these requirements can often be difficult to achieve. here we address these limitations by introducing the poisson log and zero-truncated poisson log-normal mixed effects models (pne and zpne, respectively). the generalized framework of the models allow the efficient use of covariates in modeling resighting rate and individual heterogeneity parameters, information-theoretic model selection and multimodel inference, and the incorporation of individually unidentified marks. both models may be implemented using standard statistical computing software, but they have also been added to the mark-recapture freeware package program mark. we demonstrate the use and advantages of (z) pne using black-tailed prairie dog data recently collected in colorado. we also investigate the expected relative performance of the models in simulation experiments. compared to other available estimators, we generally found (z) pne to be more precise with little or no loss in confidence interval coverage. with the recent introduction of the logit-normal mixed effects model and (z) pne, a more flexible and efficient framework for mark-resight abundance estimation is now available for the sampling conditions most commonly encountered in these studies."
"estimation of rates of births, deaths, and immigration from mark-recapture data",births; immigration; mark-recapture; model checking; survival; tits,BIOMETRICS,O HARA RB;LAMPILA S;ORELL M,"the analysis of mark-recapture data is undergoing a period of development and expansion. here we contribute to that by presenting a model which includes both births and immigration, as well as the usual deaths. data come from a long-term study of the willow tit (parus montanus), where we can assume that all births are recorded, and hence immigrants can also be identified as birds captured as adults for the first time. we model the rates of immigration, birth rate per parent, and death rates of juveniles and adults. using a hierarchical model allows us to incorporate annual variation in these parameters. the model is fitted to the data using markov chain monte carlo, as a bayesian analysis. in addition to the model fitting, we also check several aspects of the model fit, in particular whether survival varies with age or immigrant status, and whether capture probability is affected by previous capture history. the latter check is important, as independence of capture histories is a key assumption that simplifies the model considerably. here we find that the capture probability depends strongly on whether the individual was captured in the previous year."
