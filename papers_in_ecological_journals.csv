"estimating abundances, densities, and interspecific associations in a carnivore community",abundance estimation; activity center; bayesian statistics; community structure; density estimation; dingo; feral cat; red fox; spatial pair correlation function; spatially explicit mark-resight models,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,FORSYTH DM;RAMSEY DSL;WOODFORD LP,"estimating population abundances, densities, and interspecific interactions are common goals in wildlife management. camera traps have been used to estimate the abundance and density of a single species, and are useful for carnivores that occur at low densities. spatial capture-recapture (scr) models can be used to estimate abundance and density from a camera trap array when all, some, or no individuals in the population can be uniquely identified. these scr models also estimate locations of individual activity centers, the spatial patterning of which could provide important information about interspecific interactions. we used scr models to estimate abundances, densities, and activity centers of each of 3 carnivore species (i.e., dingo [canis familiaris], red fox [vulpes vulpes], and feral cat) using photographs from 1 camera trap array in southeastern australia during september to november 2015. some dingoes and feral cats were uniquely identifiable and therefore, we used a spatial mark-resight model for these species. we could not uniquely identify fox individuals, however, so we used a spatial unmarked (sun) model for this species. our estimated dingo density was 0.06/km(2). the fox (0.25/km(2)) and feral cat (0.16/km(2)) densities are within the ranges previously reported for these species in australia. we obtained a relatively imprecise fox density estimate because we did not have detections of uniquely identifiable individuals; hence, the sun model should be used as a last resort. we next modeled spatial dependence among the estimated activity centers for the 3 species using a spatial pair correlation function for a marked point process. consistent with our expectations, the activity centers of dingoes and foxes were strongly negatively associated at distances of <1,000 m. foxes and feral cats were also negatively associated at distances of <1,500 m. surprisingly, dingoes and feral cats were positively associated at distances of >500 m, with no association evident at distances of <500 m. our study extends the inferences that can be made from using a camera trap array and scr methods to include spatial patterning and interspecific interactions, and provides new insights into the carnivore community of dingoes, foxes, and feral cats in southeastern australia.

demography of a high-density tiger population and its implications for tiger recovery,breeding tigresses; corbett national park; population dynamics; pva; recruitment; source population; survival; terai arc,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,BISHT S;BANERJEE S;QURESHI Q;JHALA Y,"prioritizing conservation of source populations within landscapes is proposed as a strategy for recovering tigers globally. we studied population dynamics of tigers in corbett national park (cnp) in indian terai, which harbours the largest and highest density tiger population in any protected area of the world. through population viability models, we demonstrate the importance of cnp in tiger recovery within western terai. we camera trapped 521 km(2) of cnp using open population capture-mark-recapture framework between 2010 and 2015 to estimate annual abundance, spatially explicit density, survival, recruitment, temporary movements, sex ratio and proportion of females breeding. we model metapopulation persistence with and without corbett as a source within western terai landscape at different levels of poaching and habitat connectivity. in 6 years, we recorded 6,202 photo-captures of 307 individual tigers. annual tiger abundance and density were stable at 120 (se 19) and 14 (se 3) per 100 km(2) respectively. detection probability of tigers was 0.18 (se 0.03) and detection-corrected male:female sex ratio was female biased (0.80 se 0.13). apparent annual survival probability was 0.79 (se 0.05) for females and 0.60 (se 0.04) for males. survival of tigers in cnp (0.68 se 0.12) was lower than that reported for other populations. cnp tigers showed high reproduction with 54.8 (se 5.1)% females breeding and with addition of 35 (se 8)% as new recruits to the population each year. small tiger populations in western terai with moderate poaching could only persist through dispersal from cnp. synthesis and applications. corbett tiger population was characterized by a stable high density, high reproductive rate and low survival, resulting in high turnover rates (32%-48%) between successive years. such source populations could sustain low-level poaching and with habitat connectivity, recover tiger populations across the landscape. this study establishes potential thresholds that can likely be achieved by tiger populations under optimal natural conditions and highlights the importance of prioritizing conservation of source populations within tiger landscapes. this information can be used to plan and implement realistic tiger recovery programmes globally."
reserve size and anthropogenic disturbance affect the density of an african leopard (panthera pardus) meta-population,NA,PLOS ONE,HAVMOLLER RW;TENAN S;SCHARFF N;ROVERO F,"determining correlates of density for large carnivores is important to understand their ecological requirements and develop conservation strategies. of several earlier density studies conducted globally, relatively few addressed a scale (usually >1000 km(2)) that allows inference on correlates of density over heterogeneous landscapes. we deployed 164 camera trap stations covering similar to 2500 km(2) across five areas characterized by broadly different vegetation cover in the udzungwa mountains, tanzania, to investigate correlates of density for a widespread and adaptable carnivore, the leopard (panthera pardus). we modelled data in a spatially explicit capture-recapture framework, with both biotic and abiotic covariates hypothesised to influence density. we found that leopard density increased with distance to protected area boundary (mean +/- se estimated effect = 0.44 +/- 0.20), a proxy for both protected area extent and distance from surrounding human settlements. we estimated mean density at 4.22 leopards/100 km(2) (85% ci = 3.33-5.35/100 km(2)), with no variation across habitat types. results indicate that protected area extent and anthropogenic disturbance limit leopard populations whereas no support was found for prey availability and trap array as drivers of leopard density. such vulnerability is relevant to the conservation of the leopard, which is generally considered more resilient to human disturbance than other large cats. our findings support the notion that protected areas are important to preserve viable population of leopards, increasingly so in times of unprecedented habitat fragmentation. protection of buffer zones smoothing the abrupt impact of human activities at reserve edges also appears of critical conservation relevance."
integrated population models: powerful methods to embed individual processes in population dynamics models,data integration for population models special feature; density-dependence; eco-evolutionary feedback; heterogeneity; individual quality; integral projection model; integrated population model; population model; structured population,ECOLOGY,PLARD F;FAY R;KERY M;COHAS A;SCHAUB M,"population dynamics models have long assumed that populations are composed of a restricted number of groups, where individuals in each group have identical demographic rates and where all groups are similarly affected by density-dependent and -independent effects. however, individuals usually vary tremendously in performance and in their sensitivity to environmental conditions or resource limitation, such that individual contributions to population growth will be highly variable. recent efforts to integrate individual processes in population models open up new opportunities for the study of eco-evolutionary processes, such as the density-dependent influence of environmental conditions on the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits. we review recent advances that demonstrate how including individual mechanisms in models of population dynamics contributes to a better understanding of the drivers of population dynamics within the framework of integrated population models (ipms). ipms allow for the integration in a single inferential framework of different data types as well as variable population structure including sex, social group, or territory, all of which can be formulated to include individual-level processes. through a series of examples, we first show how ipms can be beneficial for getting more accurate estimates of demographic traits than classic matrix population models by including basic population structure and their influence on population dynamics. second, the integration of individual- and population-level data allows estimating density-dependent effects along with their inherent uncertainty by directly using the population structure and size to feedback on demography. third, we show how ipms can be used to study the influence of the dynamics of continuous individual traits and individual quality on population dynamics. we conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of ipms for integrating data at different spatial, temporal, and organismal levels to build more mechanistic models of population dynamics."
"accounting for heterogeneity when estimating stopover duration, timing and population size of red knots along the luannan coast of bohai bay, china",heterogeneity; jolly-seber; mark-recapture; migration; population size; red knot; state-space model; stopover duration,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,LOK T;HASSELL CJ;PIERSMA T;PRADEL R;GIMENEZ O,"to successfully perform their long-distance migrations, migratory birds require sites along their migratory routes to rest and refuel. monitoring the use of so-called stopover and staging sites provides insights into (a) the timing of migration and (b) the importance of a site for migratory bird populations. a recently developed bayesian superpopulation model that integrates mark-recapture data and ring density data enabled the estimation of stopover timing, duration, and population size. yet, this model did not account for heterogeneity in encounter (p) and staying (phi) probabilities. here we extended the integrated superpopulation model by implementing finite mixtures to account for heterogeneity in p and phi. we used simulations and real data (from 2009-2016) on red knots calidris canutus, mostly of the subspecies piersmai, staging in bohai bay, china, during spring migration to (a) show the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in encounter and staying probabilities to get unbiased estimates of stopover timing, duration, and numbers of migratory birds at staging sites and (b) get accurate stopover parameter estimates for a migratory bird species at a key staging site that is threatened by habitat destruction. our simulations confirmed that heterogeneity in p affected stopover parameter estimates more than heterogeneity in phi, especially when most birds had low p. bias was particularly severe when most birds had both low phi and p. bias was largest for population size, intermediate for stopover duration and negligible for stopover timing. a total of 50,000-100,000 red knots were estimated to annually stop for 5-9 days in bohai bay between 10 and 30 may. this shows the key importance of this staging site for this declining species. there were no clear changes in stopover parameters over time, although stopover population size was substantially lower in 2016 than in preceding years. our study shows the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in both encounter and staying probabilities for accurately estimating stopover duration and population size and provides an appropriate modeling framework."
acoustic telemetry as a potential tool for mixed-stock analysis of fishery harvest: a feasibility study using lake erie walleye,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,FAUST MD;VANDERGOOT CS;BRENDEN TO;KRAUS RT;HARTMAN T;KRUEGER CC,"understanding stock composition is critical for sustainable management of mixed-stock fisheries. when natural markers routinely used for stock discrimination fail, alternative techniques are required. we investigated the feasibility of using acoustic telemetry to estimate spawning population contributions to a mixed-stock fishery using lake erie's summer walleye (sander vitreus) recreational fishery as a case study. postrelease survival was estimated after tagging and used to inform simulations to evaluate how contribution estimates could be affected by survival, sample size, and expected population contributions. walleye experienced low short-term survival after tagging, but showed higher survival after 100 days, likely allowing fish to return to spawning areas the following spring. based on simulations, accuracy and precision of population composition increased with an increase in the number of tagged fish released, and both appeared to stabilize when >= 200 tagged fish were released. results supported the feasibility of using acoustic telemetry to estimate spawning population contributions to mixed-stock fisheries in lake erie."
the challenges of recognising individuals with few distinguishing features: identifying red foxes vulpes vulpes from camera-trap photos,NA,PLOS ONE,DORNING J;HARRIS S,"over the last two decades, camera traps have revolutionised the ability of biologists to undertake faunal surveys and estimate population densities, although identifying individuals of species with subtle markings remains challenging. we conducted a two-year camera-trapping study as part of a long-term study of urban foxes: our objectives were to determine whether red foxes could be identified individually from camera-trap photos, and highlight camera-trapping protocols and techniques to facilitate photo identification of species with few or subtle natural markings. we collected circa 800,000 camera-trap photos over 4945 camera days in suburban gardens in the city of bristol, uk: 152,134 (19%) included foxes, of which 13,888 (9%) contained more than one fox. these provided 174,063 timestamped capture records of individual foxes; 170,923 were of foxes >= 3 months old. younger foxes were excluded because they have few distinguishing features. we identified the individual (192 different foxes: 110 males, 49 females, 33 of unknown sex) in 168,417 (99%) of these capture records; the remainder could not be identified due to poor image quality or because key identifying feature(s) were not visible. we show that carefully designed survey techniques facilitate individual identification of subtly-marked species. accuracy is enhanced by camera-trapping techniques that yield large numbers of high resolution, colour images from multiple angles taken under varying environmental conditions. while identifying foxes manually was labour-intensive, currently available automated identification systems are unlikely to achieve the same levels of accuracy, especially since different features were used to identify each fox, the features were often inconspicuous, and their appearance varied with environmental conditions. we discuss how studies based on low numbers of photos, or which fail to identify the individual in a significant proportion of photos, risk losing important biological information, and may come to erroneous conclusions."
alzheimer's disease: estimating its prevalence rate in a french geographical unit using the national alzheimer data bank and national health insurance information systems,NA,PLOS ONE,BAILLY L;DAVID R;CHEVRIER R;GREBET J;MONCADA M;FUCH A;SCIORTINO V;ROBERT P;PRADIER C,"background reliable epidemiological data on alzheimer's disease are scarce. however, these are necessary to adapt healthcare policy in terms of prevention, care and social needs related to this condition. to estimate the prevalence rate in the alpes-maritimes on the french riviera, with a population of one million, we present a capture-recapture procedure applied to cases of alzheimer's disease, based on two epidemiological surveillance systems. methods to estimate the total number of patients affected by alzheimer's disease, a capture-recapture study included a cohort of patients with alzheimer's disease or receiving medications only eligible for use for this condition, recorded by a specific health insurance information system (health insurance cohort, hic), and those registered in the french national alzheimer's data bank (""banque nationale alzheimer"", bna) in 2010 and 2011. we applied bayesian estimation of the mt ecological model, taking into account age and gender as covariates, i.e. factors of inhomogeneous catchability. results overall, 5,562 patients with alzheimer's disease were recorded, of whom only 856 were common to both information systems. mean age and f/m sex ratio differed between bna and hic surveillance systems, 81 vs 84 years and 2.7 vs 3.2, respectively. a bayesian estimation, with age and gender as covariates, yields an estimate of 15,060 cases of alzheimer's disease [95%hpdi: 14,490-15,630] in the alpes-maritimes. the completeness of the hic and bna databases were respectively of 25.4% and 17.2%. the estimated prevalence rate among the population over 65 years old was 6.3% in 2010-2011. conclusions this study demonstrates that it is possible to determine the number of subjects affected by alzheimer's disease in a geographical unit, using available data from two existing surveillance systems in france, i.e. 15,060 cases in the alpes-maritimes. this is the first stage of a population-based approach in view of adapting available resources to the population's needs."

"seasonal variation of mortality, detectability, and body condition in a population of the adder (vipera berus)",capture-recapture; predation; seasonal variation; survival; vulnerability,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BAUWENS D;CLAUS K,"we analyzed seasonal variation in mortality rates in adult males and females of the european adder (vipera berus), using data collected during a 13-year capture-recapture study (2005-2017) in a large population. we concurrently obtained quantitative information on the seasonal variation in the detectability and body condition of adders. our results show strong seasonality in body condition, encounter, and capture rates of adult adders, and these patterns differ markedly between sexes and between breeding and nonbreeding females. seasonal variation in mortality rates was however virtually nonexistent in males and moderately low in both breeding and nonbreeding females. in addition, we found no evidence for among-year differences in the seasonal mortality schedules of males and females. during periods of intensive basking, both males and pregnant females are highly visible for humans, but are not subject to strong natural mortality. this low susceptibility to predation is presumably induced by various factors, including the limitation of overt exposure to short periods of time and specific microhabitats, the dorsal coloration pattern that provides cryptic protection and possibly also an aposematic warning signal, and presumed seasonal differences in the foraging behavior and food requirements of natural predators. our data provide some evidence that female adders, but not males, are relatively vulnerable to predation during the seasonal migrations between the hibernation and feeding habitats. mortality in the females was not much elevated during their breeding years, but was notably highest in the spring of the ensuing nonbreeding year. after giving birth, reproductive females are extremely emaciated and have a weakened general condition. they then run the risk of dying from starvation either before, during, or after hibernation. the higher mortality after giving birth, that is sustained over a period of ca. 9 months, should be considered as an indirect and delayed survival cost of reproduction."

satellite-detected forest disturbance forecasts american marten population decline: the case for supportive space-based monitoring,land-use change; spatial capture-recapture; american marten; remote sensing; monitoring; species distribution model,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,CLARE J;MCKINNEY ST;SIMONS LEGAARD EM;DEPUE JE;LOFTIN CS,"limited monitoring resources often constrain rigorous monitoring practices to species or populations of conservation concern. insufficient monitoring can induce a tautology as lack of monitoring resources makes it difficult to determine whether a species or population deserves additional monitoring resources. when in-situ monitoring resources are limited, remote habitat monitoring could be a useful supplementary tool, as linking parameterized species distribution models to spatially explicit time-series of environmental correlates allows iterative prediction of population change. yet the performance of predictive forecasts or hindcasts has been difficult to evaluate. we paired contemporary field data, historic population estimates, and a remotely-sensed archive of landscape change to evaluate predictions of american marten (martes americana) population decline owing to habitat loss in maine, usa. we estimated contemporary spatial patterns in marten density relative to landscape disturbance with spatial capture-recapture models. we compared current density estimates to historical density calculations to evaluate population decline, and compared historical calculations to habitat-based model predictions to evaluate the efficacy of habitat monitoring as a proxy for direct monitoring. marten density was negatively associated with the proportion of surrounding regenerating forest, and point estimates within focal townships were 50-80% lower than historical calculations. habitat-based hindcasts of marten density across our entire focal area interest suggested a smaller population decline (roughly 50%) within our focal area. thus, although habitat-based predictions underpredicted marten decline, they provided correct directional inference. habitat monitoring and predictions from species distribution models may provide useful inference about population changes given trends in habitat at limited expense when in-situ information is lacking."
simulation-based validation of spatial capture-recapture models: a case study using mountain lions,NA,PLOS ONE,PATERSON JT;PROFFITT K;JIMENEZ B;ROTELLA J;GARROTT R,"spatial capture-recapture (scr) models have improved the ability to estimate densities of rare and elusive animals. however, scr models have seldom been validated even as model formulations diversify and expand to incorporate new sampling methods and/or additional sources of information on model parameters. information on the relationship between encounter probabilities, sources of additional information, and the reliability of density estimates, is rare but crucial to assessing reliability of scr-based estimates. we used a simulation-based approach that incorporated prior empirical work to assess the accuracy and precision of density estimates from scr models using spatially unstructured sampling. to assess the consequences of sparse data and potential sources of bias, we simulated data under six scenarios corresponding to three different levels of search effort and two levels of correlation between search effort and animal density. we then estimated density for each scenario using four models that included increasing amounts of information from harvested individuals and telemetry to evaluate the impact of additional sources of information. model results were sensitive to the quantity of available information: density estimates based on low search effort were biased high and imprecise, whereas estimates based on high search effort were unbiased and precise. a correlation between search effort and animal density resulted in a positive bias in density estimates, though the bias decreased with increasingly informative datasets. adding information from harvested individuals and telemetered individuals improved density estimates based on low and moderate effort but had negligible impact for datasets resulting from high effort. we demonstrated that density estimates from scr models using spatially unstructured sampling are reliable when sufficient information is provided. accurate density estimates can result if empirical-based simulations such as those presented here are used to develop study designs with appropriate amounts of effort and information sources."
a small native predator reduces reproductive success of a large invasive fish as revealed by whole-lake experiments,NA,PLOS ONE,POOLE JR;BAJER PG,"the extent to which native fish communities might control the success of invasive fish has been of interest to ecologists, but it has been rarely addressed using experiments. we conducted an experiment in six small lakes in the upper mississippi region to test the effects of a small native predator, bluegill sunfish (lepomis macrochirus) on the recruitment of a large, invasive fish, the common carp (cyprinus carpio). bluegills are predominant throughout the region and were previously shown to consume carp eggs and larvae. we stocked both lakes at each of our 3 sites with adult carp (spawners) and one lake at each site with bluegills. we repeated the experiment at two of the three sites for two consecutive years. in each lake we assessed the abundance of post-larval carp one month after spawning (backpack electrofishing surveys) and at the end of the season (mark-recapture). for each site/year combination, catch rate of post-larval carp was typically an order of magnitude higher in control than bluegill lakes, but it often declined quickly over time. the abundance of end-of-seasonal juveniles was significantly higher (no 95% ci overlap) in control lakes than in bluegill lakes, except for one pair of lakes during one year when both the control and bluegill lake had similar, low abundance of end-of-season carp. overall, our results support the hypothesis that common carp recruitment is substantially reduced in habitats dominated by bluegills. we also suggest our results may be applicable to other species, and that managers should explore how predation on early life stages may control other invasive species."
generalized spatial mark-resight models with incomplete identification: an application to red fox density estimates,camera trapping; generalized spatial mark-resight; incomplete identification; mark; red fox; telemetry,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,JIMENEZ J;CHANDLER R;TOBAJAS J;DESCALZO E;MATEO R;FERRERAS P,"1. the estimation of abundance of wildlife populations is an essential part of ecological research and monitoring. spatially explicit capture-recapture (scr) models are widely used for abundance and density estimation, frequently through individual identification of target species using camera-trap sampling. 2. generalized spatial mark-resight (gen-smr) is a recently developed scr extension that allows for abundance estimation when only a subset of the population is recognizable by artificial or natural marks. however, in many cases, it is not possible to read the marks in camera-trap pictures, even though individuals can be recognized as marked. we present a new extension of gen-smr that allows for this type of incomplete identification. 3. we used simulation to assess how the number of marked individuals and the individual identification rate influenced bias and precision. we demonstrate the model's performance in estimating red fox (vulpes vulpes) density with two empirical datasets characterized by contrasting densities and rates of identification of marked individuals. according to the simulations, accuracy increases with the number of marked individuals (m), but is less sensitive to changes in individual identification rate (delta). in our case studies of red fox density estimation, we obtained a posterior mean of 1.60 (standard deviation sd: 0.32) and 0.28 (sd: 0.06) individuals/km(2), in high and low density, with an identification rate of 0.21 and 0.91, respectively. 4. this extension of gen-smr is broadly applicable as it addresses the common problem of incomplete identification of marked individuals during resighting surveys."

seasonal climate effects on the survival of a hibernating mammal,capture-mark-recapture; climate change; fitness; ground squirrel; phenology; survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,FALVO CA;KOONS DN;AUBRY LM,"global climate change and associated regional climate variability is impacting the phenology of many species, ultimately altering individual fitness and population dynamics. yet, few studies have considered the effects of pertinent seasonal climate variability on phenology and fitness. hibernators may be particularly susceptible to changes in seasonal climate since they have a relatively short active season in which to reproduce and gain enough mass to survive the following winter. to understand whether and how seasonal climate variability may be affecting hibernator fitness, we estimated survival from historical (1964-1968) and contemporary (2014-2017) mark-recapture data collected from the same population of uinta ground squirrels (ugs, urocitellus armatus), a hibernator endemic to the western united states. despite a locally warming climate, the phenology of ugs did not change over time, yet season-specific climate variables were important in regulating survival rates. specifically, older age classes experienced lower survival when winters or the following springs were warm, while juveniles benefited from warmer winter temperatures. although metabolic costs decrease with decreasing temperature in the hibernacula, arousal costs increase with decreasing temperature. our results suggest that this trade-off is experienced differently by immature and mature individuals. we also observed an increase in population density during that time period, suggesting resources are less limited today than they used to be. cheatgrass is now dominating the study site and may provide a better food source to ugs than native plants did historically."

assessing a threatened fish species under budgetary constraints: evaluating the use of existing monitoring data,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,GWINN DC;TODD CR;BROWN P;HUNT TL;BUTLER G;KITCHINGMAN A;KOEHN JD;INGRAM B,"because of the high costs of collecting field data, many species recovery and management plans do not include a monitoring feedback component to measure the success of interventions and refine management strategies. here, we demonstrate how leveraging existing monitoring data can provide broad-scale, cost-effective information about a threatened fish species, the murray cod maccullochella peelii, which is of cultural and recreational importance in australia. we applied a bayesian hierarchical model of abundance to murray cod catch data collected as part of broad-scale, general condition monitoring in the murray-darling basin. the model uses replicated sampling at spatially independent sites to disentangle the confounding effects of detection probability and abundance on catch data. we demonstrate the reliability of the analysis for determining trends in abundance with a simulation study, and we show that basinwide abundance of murray cod declined by over 50% between 2010 and 2013. we found that detection probability of murray cod can vary substantially across space and through time, suggesting that accounting for variable detection will be important in any future evaluation of murray cod populations. this study highlights variable detection as an issue in monitoring regimes and demonstrates a method for the cost-effective use of existing monitoring data to evaluate species abundance trends."
demographic consequences of climate variation along an elevational gradient for a montane terrestrial salamander,capture-recapture; growth; life history; mcmc; plethodon; survival,POPULATION ECOLOGY,CARUSO NM;RISSLER LJ,"climate change represents a significant threat to amphibians. however, for many species, the relationship between demography and climate is unknown, which limits predictive models. here, we describe the life history variation of plethodon montanus using capture-recapture data over a period of 4 years, along an elevational gradient to determine how survival and growth vary with climate, and how these relationships vary with elevation. we used a hierarchical model to estimate asymptotic size and growth rate and a spatial cormack-jolly-seber model to estimate the probability of capture and survival and dispersal variance. we found that during the active season, growth and survival rates are both positively affected by precipitation; however, while survival was positively affected by temperature at all elevations, higher temperatures led to a decrease in growth at lower elevations, while at higher elevations the opposite was true. during the inactive season, we found reduced growth rates, whereas survival was lower compared with the active at lower elevations but was higher at higher elevations. increased inactive season temperatures resulted in decreased survival while we found that temperature, amount of snow, and elevation interacted to influence survival. at low elevations, which were warmer, survival decreased with increasing snowfall but at higher elevations, survival generally increased with increasing snowfall. our results demonstrate that understanding how the environment can affect salamander demography to develop mechanistic models will require knowledge of the actual environmental conditions experienced by a given population as well as an understanding of the overall differences in climate at a given site."

modest immigration can rescue a reintroduced carnivore population,endangered; great lakes; immigration; martes americana; translocation; viability,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,GRAUER JA;GILBERT JH;WOODFORD JE;EKLUND D;ANDERSON S;PAULI JN,"reintroductions are frequently conducted to restore carnivore populations, though many fail despite following best management practices. although demographic approaches are increasingly used to assess reintroduced populations, immigration is often overlooked in reintroduction planning and assessment. american martens (martes americana) were reintroduced to 2 sites in wisconsin, the nicolet and chequamegon national forests, which have anecdotally experienced differential population recovery. via non-invasive sampling and a mark-recapture framework, we explored the possible mechanisms behind the divergent trajectories of the nicolet national forest (nicolet) population, which appears to be recovering, and the chequamegon national forest (chequamegon) population, which appears to be declining toward extinction. we tested for site-level differences in survival, estimated population size, and calculated immigration rates based on simulations of the original reintroductions to the nicolet. we then projected each population forward, both with and without our estimated immigration rate. we calculated a current population size of 66 female martens in the nicolet, and estimated that the reintroduced population would have reached this size if supplemented by 1 female immigrant per year. we simulated future populations with the estimate of 1 female immigrant per year; this sustained level of immigration to the nicolet reduced the probability of extinction to <1% over the next 100 years. when we applied the same rate of immigration to the starting population of 22 female martens in the chequamegon, extinction probabilities were reduced by approximately 30%. despite similarities between the 2 reintroduction sites, we propose that the differential population recovery was primarily due to modest rates of immigration to the nicolet and the relative isolation of the chequamegon population. martens in the chequamegon have been projected to go extinct in the foreseeable future, yet increasing connectivity with the nicolet or upper peninsula of michigan could improve persistence. our results illustrate the effect of modest immigration on reintroduction success and the importance of planning for connectivity across reintroduction sites.

time-for-space substitution in n-mixture modeling and population monitoring,hierarchical models; monitoring; population dynamics; population size; species decline; trend,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,COSTA A;ONETO F;SALVIDIO S,"population size is a fundamental state variable in ecology, and the analysis of temporal variation in abundance (i.e., detection of trends) is a prime objective in wildlife monitoring. however, population abundance cannot be directly observed because part of the population remains undetected and methods that account for imperfect detection are often not used. capture-mark-recapture approaches give reliable estimates of abundance but are time- and effort-consuming. in the last decade, the application of hierarchical, or n-mixture, models that use repeated counts of unmarked animals seem to give great advantages in the estimation of population size. hierarchical models require repeated surveys at multiple sites, but sometimes only data obtained for a single site in successive years are available. we applied the time-for-space substitution implemented within the n-mixture modeling framework to estimate population size and evaluate the dynamics of the endangered european leaf-toed gecko (euleptes europaea) surveyed >20 years. we compared these results with capture-mark-recapture estimates obtained from the same population and over the same time period. estimates and trends were comparable and both methods indicated similar population declines; moreover, n-mixture modeling indicated temperature affected detection. therefore, the application of the time-for-space substitution in hierarchical modeling seems valuable and may be useful in species monitoring and conservation.

drivers of survival in a small mammal of conservation concern: an assessment using extensive genetic non-invasive sampling in fragmented farmland,agricultural intensification; capwire; cormark-jolly-seber; mediterranean farmland; microtus cabrerae; road effects,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,PROENCA FERREIRA A;FERREIRA C;LEITAO I;PAUPERIO J;SABINO MARQUES H;BARBOSA S;LAMBIN X;ALVES PC;BEJA P;MOREIRA F;MIRA A;PITA R,"although important to guide conservation management, detailed demographic studies on rare or elusive species inhabiting fragmented, human-dominated landscapes are often hampered by the species' low densities, and the logistic and ethical constraints in obtaining reliable information covering large areas. genetic non-invasive sampling (gnis) provides cost-effective access to demographic information, though its application to small mammals is still scarce. we used gnis to infer on the demography of an endemic small mammal, the cabrera vole (microtus cabrerae), occurring as a spatially-structured population in a 462-ha mediterranean farmland landscape. we intensively sampled fresh vole feces in four seasons, extracted the dna, and performed individual identification based on genotypes built using nine microsatellites. we then estimated population size and individual survival relative to environmental variables, controlling for heterogeneity in capture probabilities using capture-mark-recapture modelling. population size increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season, while survival remained constant across the study period. individuals captured along road-verges and around water-bodies survived longer than those captured near agricultural fields. the use of gnis on a heterogeneous landscape such as our study area allowed us to demonstrate that human land-use activities affect cabrera vole demographic parameters in mediterranean farmland, with implications for conservation planning towards its long-term persistence. our approach can be widely applied to other elusive small mammals of conservation concern, but for which informative demographic data are still scarce."
the adequacy of aging techniques in vertebrates for rapid estimation of population mortality rates from age distributions,age estimation; aging error; birth rate; demographics; mark-recapture; survival rate,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ZHAO MJ;KLAASSEN CAJ;LISOVSKI S;KLAASSEN M,"as a key parameter in population dynamics, mortality rates are frequently estimated using mark-recapture data, which requires extensive, long-term data sets. as a potential rapid alternative, we can measure variables correlated to age, allowing the compilation of population age distributions, from which mortality rates can be derived. however, most studies employing such techniques have ignored their inherent inaccuracy and have thereby failed to provide reliable mortality estimates. in this study, we present a general statistical model linking birth rate, mortality rate, and population age distributions. we next assessed the reliability and data needs (i.e., sample size) for estimating mortality rate of eight different aging techniques. the results revealed that for half of the aging techniques, correlations with age varied considerably, translating into highly variable accuracies when used to estimate mortality rate from age distributions. telomere length is generally not sufficiently correlated to age to provide reliable mortality rate estimates. dna methylation, signal-joint t-cell recombination excision circle (sjtrec), and racemization are generally more promising techniques to ultimately estimate mortality rate, if a sufficiently high sample size is available. otolith ring counts, otolithometry, and age-length keys in fish, and skeletochronology in reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, outperformed all other aging techniques and generated relatively accurate mortality rate estimation with a sample size that can be feasibly obtained. provided the method chosen is minimizing and estimating the error in age estimation, it is possible to accurately estimate mortality rates from age distributions. the method therewith has the potential to estimate a critical, population dynamic parameter to inform conservation efforts within a limited time frame as opposed to mark-recapture analyses."

toward reliable population density estimates of partially marked populations using spatially explicit mark-resight methods,camera trap; capture-recapture; fox; maximum likelihood; mesopredator; survey design; vulpes vulpes,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CARTER A;POTTS JM;ROSHIER DA,"camera traps are used increasingly to estimate population density for elusive and difficult to observe species. a standard practice for mammalian surveys is to place cameras on roads, trails, and paths to maximize detections and/or increase efficiency in the field. however, for many species it is unclear whether track-based camera surveys provide reliable estimates of population density. understanding how the spatial arrangement of camera traps affects population density estimates is of key interest to contemporary conservationists and managers given the rapid increase in camera-based wildlife surveys. we evaluated the effect of camera-trap placement, using several survey designs, on density estimates of a widespread mesopredator, the red fox vulpes vulpes, over a two-year period in a semi-arid conservation reserve in south-eastern australia. further, we used the certainty in the identity and whereabouts of individuals (via gps collars) to assess how resighting rates of marked foxes affect density estimates using maximum likelihood spatially explicit mark-resight methods. fox detection rates were much higher at cameras placed on tracks compared with off-track cameras, yet in the majority of sessions, camera placement had relatively little effect on point estimates of density. however, for each survey design, the precision of density estimates varied considerably across sessions, influenced heavily by the absolute number of marked foxes detected, the number of times marked foxes was resighted, and the number of detection events of unmarked foxes. our research demonstrates that the precision of population density estimates using spatially explicit mark-resight models is sensitive to resighting rates of identifiable individuals. nonetheless, camera surveys based either on- or off-track can provide reliable estimates of population density using spatially explicit mark-resight models. this underscores the importance of incorporating information on the spatial behavior of the subject species when planning camera-trap surveys."

non-circular home ranges and the estimation of population density,anisotropic detection function; density estimation; home range; non-circularity; radiotelemetry; spatially explicit capture-recapture; study design; telemetry-scaled non-spatial estimator,ECOLOGY,EFFORD MG,"spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) models have emerged as one solution to the problem of estimating the population density of mobile and cryptic animals. spatial models embody assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of individuals and the spatial detection process. the detection process is modeled in secr as a radial decline in detection probability with distance from the activity center of each individual. this would seem to require that home ranges are circular. the robustness of secr when home ranges are not circular has been the subject of conflicting statements. ivan et al. previously compared the secr density estimator to a telemetry-scaled non-spatial estimator. i suggest that the apparent non-robustness of secr in their study was a simulation artefact. new simulations of elliptical home ranges establish that the secr density estimator is largely robust to non-circularity when detectors are spread in two dimensions, but may be very biased if the detector array is linear and home ranges align with the array. transformation to isotropy reduces bias from designs of intermediate dimension, such as hollow square arrays. possible alignment of home ranges should be considered when designing detector arrays."

multi-state dead recovery mark-recovery model performance for estimating movement and mortality rates,atlantic menhaden; brevoortia tyrannus; brownie mark-recovery model; mark-recovery study design; mark-recapture,FISHERIES RESEARCH,LILJESTRAND EM;WILBERG MJ;SCHUELLER AM,"multi-state mark-recovery models are used to estimate movement and mortality rates of terrestrial and aquatic animals. these models have become especially popular in the last 20 years since technology and statistical techniques have improved to accommodate the extensive data requirements. however, the ability of multi-state mark-recovery models to estimate movement rates has received little evaluation, with few studies exploring the effects of alternative release and recovery designs on the bias and precision of estimates. our objectives were to evaluate the effects of the spatio-temporal pattern of releases, pattern of recovery efforts, and number of releases on the performance of a multi-state mark-recovery model. we generated mark-recovery data from a spatial model and fitted them using a multi-state dead recovery model that included prior distributions on movement rates, natural mortality, and catchability. we generated data using a spatially variable schedule of releases and effort, and a release size of about 1 million individuals to mimic a mark-recovery study conducted for atlantic menhaden brevoortia tyrannus in the late 1960s. we also ran alternative scenarios of sample size and spatially uniform releases and effort, either by themselves or in combination to determine their effects on the accuracy of the estimates. the model generally produced unbiased estimates of mortality rates with median error < 0.02 yr(-1) for all scenarios, but some biases were present for the movement rates. movement rates and catchability were more accurately and precisely estimated in scenarios that included spatially uniform fishing effort, while spatially uniform releases had little to no effect on bias or precision of estimated movement rates. increased sample size improved accuracy of all parameter estimates except for the lowest movement rates. future mark-recovery experiments that use a multi-state dead recovery model may benefit from distributing recovery effort uniformly over time and space."

making use of multiple surveys: estimating breeding probability using a multievent-robust design capture-recapture model,auxiliary data; breeding propensity; elephant seal; incidental observations; intermittent breeding; robust design; unobservable state,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,OOSTHUIZEN WC;PRADEL R;BESTER MN;DE BRUYN PJN,"increased environmental stochasticity due to climate change will intensify temporal variance in the life-history traits, and especially breeding probabilities, of long-lived iteroparous species. these changes may decrease individual fitness and population viability and is therefore important to monitor. in wild animal populations with imperfect individual detection, breeding probabilities are best estimated using capture-recapture methods. however, in many vertebrate species (e.g., amphibians, turtles, seabirds), nonbreeders are unobservable because they are not tied to a territory or breeding location. although unobservable states can be used to model temporary emigration of nonbreeders, there are disadvantages to having unobservable states in capture-recapture models. the best solution to deal with unobservable life-history states is therefore to eliminate them altogether. here, we achieve this objective by fitting novel multievent-robust design models which utilize information obtained from multiple surveys conducted throughout the year. we use this approach to estimate annual breeding probabilities of capital breeding female elephant seals (mirounga leonina). conceptually, our approach parallels a multistate version of the barker/robust design in that it combines robust design capture data collected during discrete breeding seasons with observations made at other times of the year. a substantial advantage of our approach is that the nonbreeder state became observable when multiple data sources were analyzed together. this allowed us to test for the existence of state-dependent survival (with some support found for lower survival in breeders compared to nonbreeders), and to estimate annual breeding transitions to and from the nonbreeder state with greater precision (where current breeders tended to have higher future breeding probabilities than nonbreeders). we used program e-surge (2.1.2) to fit the multievent-robust design models, with uncertainty in breeding state assignment (breeder, nonbreeder) being incorporated via a hidden markov process. this flexible modeling approach can easily be adapted to suit sampling designs from numerous species which may be encountered during and outside of discrete breeding seasons."
estimability of migration survival rates from integrated breeding and winter capture-recapture data,bayesian; cormack-jolly-seber; demography; integrated population model; mark-recapture; migration; migratory connectivity; survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,RUSHING CS,"long-distance migration is a common phenomenon across the animal kingdom but the scale of annual migratory movements has made it difficult for researchers to estimate survival rates during these periods of the annual cycle. estimating migration survival is particularly challenging for small-bodied species that cannot carry satellite tags, a group that includes the vast majority of migratory species. when capture-recapture data are available for linked breeding and non-breeding populations, estimation of overall migration survival is possible but current methods do not allow separate estimation of spring and autumn survival rates. recent development of a bayesian integrated survival model has provided a method to separately estimate the latent spring and autumn survival rates using capture-recapture data, though the accuracy and precision of these estimates has not been formally tested. here, i used simulated data to explore the estimability of migration survival rates using this model. under a variety of biologically realistic scenarios, i demonstrate that spring and autumn migration survival can be estimated from the integrated survival model, though estimates are biased toward the overall migration survival probability. the direction and magnitude of this bias are influenced by the relative difference in spring and autumn survival rates as well as the degree of annual variation in these rates. the inclusion of covariates can improve the model's performance, especially when annual variation in migration survival rates is low. migration survival rates can be estimated from relatively short time series (4-5years), but bias and precision of estimates are improved when longer time series (10-12years) are available. the ability to estimate seasonal survival rates of small, migratory organisms opens the door to advancing our understanding of the ecology and conservation of these species. application of this method will enable researchers to better understand when mortality occurs across the annual cycle and how the migratory periods contribute to population dynamics. integrating summer and winter capture data requires knowledge of the migratory connectivity of sampled populations and therefore efforts to simultaneously collect both survival and tracking data should be a high priority, especially for species of conservation concern."
effects of distance on detectability of arctic waterfowl using double-observer sampling during helicopter surveys,aerial survey; detection probability; distance sampling; mark-recapture,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ALISAUSKAS RT;CONN PB,"aerial survey is an important, widely employed approach for estimating free-ranging wildlife over large or inaccessible study areas. we studied how a distance covariate influenced probability of double-observer detections for birds counted during a helicopter survey in canada's central arctic. two observers, one behind the other but visually obscured from each other, counted birds in an incompletely shared field of view to a distance of 200 m. each observer assigned detections to one of five 40-m distance bins, guided by semi-transparent marks on aircraft windows. detections were recorded with distance bin, taxonomic group, wing-flapping behavior, and group size. we compared two general model-based estimation approaches pertinent to sampling wildlife under such situations. one was based on double-observer methods without distance information, that provide sampling analogous to that required for mark-recapture (mr) estimation of detection probability, (p) over cap, and group abundance, (g) over cap, along a fixed-width strip transect. the other method incorporated double-observer mr with a categorical distance covariate (mrd). a priori, we were concerned that estimators from mr models were compromised by heterogeneity in (p) over cap due to un-modeled distance information; that is, more distant birds are less likely to be detected by both observers, with the predicted effect that (p) over cap would be biased high, and (g) over cap biased low. we found that, despite increased complexity, mrd models (delta aicc range: 0-16) fit data far better than mr models (delta aicc range: 204-258). however, contrary to expectation, the more naive mr estimators of p were biased low in all cases, but only by 2%-5% in most cases. we suspect that this apparently anomalous finding was the result of specific limitations to, and trade-offs in, visibility by observers on the survey platform used. while mr models provided acceptable point estimates of group abundance, their far higher stranded errors (0%-40%) compared to mrd estimates would compromise ability to detect temporal or spatial differences in abundance. given improved precision of mrd models relative to mr models, and the possibility of bias when using mr methods from other survey platforms, we recommend avian ecologists use mrd protocols and estimation procedures when surveying arctic bird populations."

multiple density-dependent processes shape the dynamics of a spatially structured amphibian population,amphibian; density dependence; dispersal; population growth rate; spatially structured populations; survival; triturus cristatus,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,CAYUELA H;SCHMIDT BR;WEINBACH A;BESNARD A;JOLY P,"understanding the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of spatially structured populations (ssp) is a critical challenge for ecologists and conservation managers. internal population processes such as births and deaths occur at a local level, while external processes such as dispersal take place at an inter-population level. at both levels, density dependence is expected to play a critical role. at a patch scale, demographic traits (e.g., survival, breeding success) and the population growth rate can be influenced by density either negatively (e.g., competition effect) or positively (e.g., allee effects). at the scale of an ssp, although positive density-dependent dispersal has been widely reported, an increasing number of studies have highlighted negative density-dependent dispersal. while many studies have investigated the effects of density on population growth or on dispersal, few have simultaneously examined density-dependent effects at the scale of both the local population and the entire ssp. in this study, we examine how density is related to demographic processes at both the pond level (survival and population growth) and the ssp level (between-pond dispersal) in a pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt (triturus cristatus). the study was based on 20 years of individual capture-recapture (cr) data (from 1996 to 2015) gathered from an ssp made up of 12 experimental ponds (""patches""). we first used a cr multievent model to estimate both survival and dispersal rates in specific ponds as a function of distance between ponds. then, using a second cr multievent model, we examined whether survival and recapture rates were influenced by population density in a pond. lastly, we used state-space time series models to investigate whether density affected population growth in each pond. our results found a positive density-dependent effect on survival and a negative density-dependent effect on departure. in addition, the findings indicate that population growth was negatively related to density in all 12 ponds. these results support the hypothesis that in ssps, density may have multiple and contrasting effects on demographic parameters and growth rates within local populations as well as on dispersal. this study underlines the need to better understand how density dependence may influence potential trade-offs between life-history strategies and life-history stages."

efficacy of depletion models for estimating abundance of endangered fishes in streams,depletion sampling; bayesian mixture models; endangered species; known abundance; removal sampling; variable detection,FISHERIES RESEARCH,STEWART DR;BUTLER MJ;JOHNSON LA;CAJERO A;YOUNG AN;HARRIS GM,"conservation programs for imperiled fish require a sampling method for quantifying their habitat relationships and their progress toward recovery, via abundance estimation and subsequent monitoring. depletion sampling is a commonly used method, although the assumptions of homogeneous capture probabilities are tenuous. recently, bayesian hierarchical models have been used to describe the conditional relationships between abundance of animals and detection probability, but their performance remains untested when detection varies across successive passes. we tested such approaches within a depletion-sampling framework for estimating abundance of three endemic and imperiled fish species in southeastern arizona, usa. our procedure uses depletion sampling, via simulation and field trials, and removes the untenable assumption of constant detectability across sampling passes. specifically, we evaluated how population size, the number of depletion passes, the probability of fish detection, the amount of decline in this probability across removal passes, and the effects of variable detection probability affect bias and precision when using models with constant and variable detection probability. abundance estimates were negatively biased when detection probability declined by 20% or more across successive passes, with detection probability < 0.30 on the first pass. when detection probability declined by < 10% across successive passes, unbiased estimates could be attained with detection probabilities of 0.20. increasing depletion passes improved precision but not bias. field trials underscored the importance of incorporating changes in detection probability among species and successive depletion passes. our work demonstrates the efficacy of depletion experiments to estimate abundance, and highlights the importance of sampling a known abundance to accompany simulation analyses. monitoring programs ignoring variability in detection probability using a depletion framework can produce biased abundance estimates."
migration tactics affect spawning frequency in an iteroparous salmonid (salvelinus malma) from the arctic,NA,PLOS ONE,GALLAGHER CP;HOWLAND KL;SANDSTROM SJ;HALDEN NM,"otolith strontium and multi-year mark-recapture information were used to characterize associations between migration patterns and spawning frequencies in an anadromous dolly varden (salvelinus malma) population (rat river, northwest territories, canada) that undertakes a long migration between freshwater spawning/overwintering (fish creek; a tributary to rat river) and marine feeding habitats (beaufort sea) (similar to 800 km round trip). reconstructions of lifetime annual migration histories among otolith annuli was matched to information on reproductive status (current-year 'spawner' or 'non-spawner') that was known in two different, sometimes successive, years for each fish. two migratory life histories were observed: fish either migrated annually after smoltification or periodically skipped an annual ocean migration to remain in freshwater and spawn. different spawning frequencies were detected where fish not migrating annually tended to spawn in alternate years (84.6%) more often than those migrating annually (50%). additionally, annually migrating fish had lower longevity (<= 9 years vs. <= 13 years). the evaluation of differences in spawning frequency between sexes, independent of migration tactic, revealed males (84.6%) skipped spawning more often than females (51.2%) suggesting fitness trade-offs between life histories differ between sexes. further, some fish returned from the sea considerably earlier than the majority of other current-year migrants. our findings demonstrate intrapopulation diversity in migration behaviour and reproductive frequency."
a new mark-recapture approach for abundance estimation of social species,NA,PLOS ONE,HICKEY JR;SOLLMANN R,"accurate estimates of population abundance are a critical component of species conservation efforts in order to monitor the potential recovery of populations. capture-mark-recapture (cmr) is a widely used approach to estimate population abundance, yet social species moving in groups violate the assumption of cmr approaches that all individuals in the population are detected independently. we developed a closed cmr model that addresses an important characteristic of group-living species-that individual-detection probability typically is conditional on group detection. henceforth termed the two-step model, this approach first estimates group-detection probability and then-conditional on group detection-estimates individual-detection probability for individuals within detected groups. overall abundance is estimated assuming that undetected groups have the same average group size as detected groups. we compared the performance of this two-step cmr model to a conventional (one-step) closed cmr model that ignored group structure. we assessed model sensitivity to variation in both group- and individual-detection probability. both models returned overall unbiased estimates of abundance, but the one-step model returned deceptively narrow bayesian confidence intervals (bci) that failed to encompass the correct population abundance an average 52% of the time. contrary, under the two-step model, ci coverage was on average 96%. both models had similar root mean squared errors (rmse), except for scenarios with low group detection probability, where the two-step model had much lower rmse. for illustration with a real data set, we applied the two-step and regular model to non-invasive genetic capture-recapture data of mountain gorillas (gorilla beringei beringei). as with simulations, abundance estimates under both models were similar, but the two-step model estimate had a wider confidence interval. results support using the two-step model for species living in constant groups, particularly when group detection probability is low, to reduce risk of bias and adequately portray uncertainty in abundance estimates. important sources of variation in detection need to be incorporated into the two-step model when applying it to field data."
early returning long-distance migrant males do pay a survival cost,capture-mark-recapture; differential migration; fitness; optimal timing; protandry,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,LERCHE JORGENSEN M;KORNER NIEVERGELT F;TOTTRUP AP;WILLEMOES M;THORUP K,"timing of return to the breeding area presumably optimizes breeding output in migrants. how timing affects the other components of fitness - survival, has been comparatively little studied. returning too early in spring is expected to be associated with high mortality in insectivorous migrants when weather conditions are still unsuitable. yet, males in particular arrive early to get access to the best territories which have been suggested to cause arrival before it is optimal for their survival. for the outward migration in autumn, timing is presumably less directly associated with reproduction and fitness and how it might affect survival is not well understood. we use data of eight songbird species ringed across denmark to investigate how timing of return migration in spring and departure migration in autumn close to the breeding areas affects survival for short- and long-distance migrants. further, we compare survival optimum to the timing of males and females at a stopover site in denmark in three sexually dimorphic, protandric species. we find a clear relationship between return migration and survival which differs between short- and long-distance migrants: survival decreases with date for short-distance migrants and a bell-shaped relationship, with low survival for earliest and latest individuals, for long-distance migrants. in protandric species, the majority of males return before survival is optimal, whereas females on average return close to the survival optimum. the pattern of survival in relation to autumn timing is less clear, although a similar bell-shaped relationship is suggested for long-distance migrants. our findings support the predicted mortality consequences of too early return to the breeding grounds and also that selection for early return in males leads to suboptimal migration timing regarding survival."
non-linear effect of sea ice: spectacled eider survival declines at both extremes of the ice spectrum,bering sea; mark-recapture; sea ice; somateria fischeri; spectacled eider; survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CHRISTIE KS;HOLLMEN TE;FLINT P;DOUGLAS D,"understanding the relationship between environmental factors and vital rates is an important step in predicting a species' response to environmental change. species associated with sea ice are of particular concern because sea ice is projected to decrease rapidly in polar environments with continued levels of greenhouse gas emissions. the relationship between sea ice and the vital rates of the spectacled eider, a threatened species that breeds in alaska and russia and winters in the bering sea, appears to be complex. while severe ice can impede foraging for benthic prey, ice also suppresses wave action and provides a platform on which eiders roost, thereby reducing thermoregulation costs. we analyzed a 23-year mark-recapture dataset for spectacled eiders nesting on kigigak island in western alaska, and tested survival models containing different ice and weather-related covariates. we found that much of the variation in eider survival could be explained by the number of days per year with >95% sea ice concentration at the bering sea core wintering area. furthermore, the data supported a quadratic relationship with sea ice rather than a linear one, indicating that intermediate sea ice concentrations were optimal for survival. we then used matrix population models to project population trajectories using general circulation model (gcm) outputs of daily sea ice cover. gcms projected reduced sea ice at the wintering area by year 2100 under a moderated emissions scenario (rcp 4.5) and nearly ice-free conditions under an unabated emissions scenario (rcp 8.5). under rcp 4.5, stochastic models projected an increase in population size until 2069 coincident with moderate ice conditions, followed by a decline in population size as ice conditions shifted from intermediate to mostly ice-free. under rcp 8.5, eider abundance increased until 2040 and then decreased to near extirpation toward the end of the century as the bering sea became ice-free. considerable uncertainty around parameter estimates for survival in years with minimal sea ice contributed to variation in stochastic projections of future population size, and this uncertainty could be reduced with additional survival data from low-ice winters."
the effects of early sandbar formation on the abundance and ecology of coho salmon (oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in a central california coastal lagoon,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,OSTERBACK AMK;KERN CH;KANAWI EA;PEREZ JM;KIERNAN JD,"we investigated how extreme drought conditions influenced the abundance, growth, movement, and seawater readiness of juvenile coho salmon (oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in a small central california coastal lagoon. in 2015, the seasonal sandbar at the mouth of scott creek formed over 2 months earlier than average, effectively trapping fish in the lagoon for 7 additional months (mid-may through december) before outmigration opportunities eventually resumed. monthly mark-recapture sampling demonstrated that juvenile coho salmon and steelhead were able to persist in the lagoon during extended periods of high water temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentration. both salmonid species exhibited similar temporal trends in abundance, growth, and na+-k+-atpase activity levels during lagoon residence; however, abundance and growth rates were consistently higher for steelhead. stationary passive integrated transponder tag antenna detections revealed recurrent movement of individuals between the warm lagoon and cooler lower mainstem creek, suggesting individuals regulated key physiological processes by moving between the adjacent habitats. our study provides new insight concerning the consequences of drought for imperiled salmonid populations and underscores the importance of life-history diversity during extreme climatic events."

statistical test for detecting overdispersion in offspring number based on kinship information,close kin mark recapture; negative binomial distribution; overdispersion; relatedness; sweepstakes reproductive success,POPULATION ECOLOGY,AKITA T,"in this paper, we develop a theory of a new statistic that tests overdispersion in offspring number on the basis of exactly known kinship relationships. the statistic utilizes the sample size and the number of kinship pairs found in a sample, specially the number of mother-offspring (mo) and maternal-half-sibling (mhs) pairs. given a sufficiently large sample size, the statistic proposed in this paper approximately follows a standard-normal distribution under non-overdispersed conditions (poisson's variance). we found that (1) the value of the statistic reasonably indicates whether reproduction is overdispersed at the 5% significance level; (2) the power of the statistic is determined primarily by the balance between the degree of overdispersion and the sample size; (3) in many cases, if the number of kinship pairs can be approximated by a normal distribution, false-positive and false-negative situations can be avoided. the proposed method can detect moderate-weak levels of overdispersion that produce few mhs pairs in a sample because the effect of the population size (which determines the number of detected mhs pairs) is canceled by the detection of the number of mo pairs. once the kinship determination procedure is established, this indirect measurement will be readily applicable to species even with weak overdispersion, expanding the available opportunities for understanding how overdispersion in offspring number affects ecological processes."
modelling heterogeneity in detection probabilities in land and aerial abundance surveys in humpback whales (megaptera novaeangliae),aerial survey; detection probability; g(0); land-based survey; population survey,POPULATION ECOLOGY,DUDGEON CL;DUNLOP RA;NOAD MJ,"the effective management and conservation of animal populations relies on statistically-sound and replicable surveys to obtain estimates of abundance and assess trends. surveys of cetaceans, such as humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae, are difficult to conduct and are particularly affected by bias in detection probability. for example, the probability of detection of whales from land decreases substantially with increased distance from the platform. this distance effect is also true for aerial surveys, combined with the problem that animals are unavailable for detection (underwater) whilst in the field of view. we present a novel approach that combines corrected double-platform land surveys with corrected aerial surveys to obtain a robust estimate of g(0), the probability of detection on the survey line, for aerial surveys of migrating humpback whales. several sources of heterogeneity in detection probabilities were identified within the land and aerial surveys (including group composition, bearing of first sighting, number of groups being tracked simultaneously and cloud cover). after including these into our estimate of g(0), we found that only 29% of available whales are being detected on the survey line (g(0)=0.288), which is a considerably smaller estimate than many available for humpback whales using other methods. incorporating heterogeneity into the population surveys shows that we are likely to be underestimating the population size of whales on the east coast of australia. the implications of this result for their conservation and management in light of increased whale-human conflict is discussed."
age-specific estimates indicate potential deleterious capture effects and low survival of stocked juvenile colorado pikeminnow,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,CLARK SR;CONNER MM;DURST SL;FRANSSEN NR,"hatcheries and stocking programs have become necessary to repatriate or augment populations of imperiled fishes worldwide. over nearly two decades, millions of endangered juvenile colorado pikeminnow ptychocheilus lucius have been stocked into the san juan river (colorado, new mexico, and utah); however, recruitment of these individuals to adult life stages (age 6) remains low. using a mark-recapture data set collected from annual riverwide electrofishing efforts between 2003 and 2016, we investigated apparent survival and capture probabilities of stocked colorado pikeminnow to identify age-specific bottlenecks contributing to this lack of recruitment. with relatively high capture rates, which averaged between 0.34 and 0.39 for the first 2years after an individual's first encounter, our results indicated that survival was consistently less than 0.25 for young age-groups (i.e., ages 1-3), and no appreciable increase in survival occurred until fish had been in the river for at least 3years (i.e., age 4+). although age and capture effects were confounded for most age-groups, capture appeared to reduce apparent survival for age-2 fish by approximately 50%. the confounding effects of age, a completely hatchery-origin population, and extensive environmental alterations to the san juan river make it difficult to disentangle factors associated with this overall reduced juvenile survival."
sampling the stream landscape: improving the applicability of an ecoregion-level capture probability model for stream fishes,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,MOLLENHAUER R;MOUSER JB;BREWER SK,"temporal and spatial variability in streams result in heterogeneous gear capture probability (i.e., the proportion of available individuals identified) that confounds interpretation of data used to monitor fish abundance. we modeled tow-barge electrofishing capture probability at multiple spatial scales for nine ozark highland stream fishes. in addition to fish size, we identified seven reach-scale environmental characteristics associated with variable capture probability: stream discharge, water depth, conductivity, water clarity, emergent vegetation, wetted width-depth ratio, and proportion of riffle habitat. the magnitude of the relationship between capture probability and both discharge and depth varied among stream fishes. we also identified lithological characteristics among stream segments as a coarse-scale source of variable capture probability. the resulting capture probability model can be used to adjust catch data and derive reach-scale absolute abundance estimates across a wide range of sampling conditions with similar effort as used in more traditional fisheries surveys (i.e., catch per unit effort). adjusting catch data based on variable capture probability improves the comparability of data sets, thus promoting both well-informed conservation and management decisions and advances in stream-fish ecology."
intra- and interspecific densities shape life-history traits in a salmonid population,density dependence; juvenile survival; life-history tactics; migration probability; multi-event model,OECOLOGIA,MONTORIO L;EVANNO G;NEVOUX M,"population dynamics can be regulated through intra- and interspecific density dependence. in species with close ecological requirements, interspecific competition for resources may add to intraspecific density, or even exceed its effect; it may impact single or multiple traits. however, the relative impact of intra- and interspecific densities on demographic parameters has been rarely empirically assessed. we analyzed 18 years of capture-mark-recapture data from brown trout (salmo trutta) coexisting with atlantic salmon (salmo salar) during the juvenile freshwater phase in the oir river (france) to estimate the relative effects of intra- and interspecific density on trout early life. in trout, a species with optional migration, we estimated the migration probability of young-of-the-year trout out of their natal site, survival probability during the first winter, as well as body size, in relation to both intra- and interspecific density. trout density correlated negatively with body size and with winter survival in resident trout but not with trout migration. salmon density correlated positively with trout migration, but no impact was detected on trout body size or survival. our study highlighted contrasting effects of intra- and interspecific density on trout early life, and the need to account for both factors when studying population dynamics in coexisting species. in particular, by affecting trout migration decision, salmon density may drive trout life history."
multiple challenges confront a high-effort inland recreational fishery in decline,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,CAHILL CL;MOGENSEN S;WILSON KL;CANTIN A;SINNATAMBY RN;PAUL AJ;CHRISTENSEN P;REILLY JR;WINKEL L;FARINEAU A;POST JR,"catch-and-release regulations designed to protect fisheries may fail to halt population declines, particularly in situations where fishing effort is high and when multiple stressors threaten a population. we demonstrate this claim using alberta's bow river, which supports a high-effort rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) fishery where anglers voluntarily release >99% of their catch. we examined the population trend of adult trout, which were tagged and recaptured using electro-fishing surveys conducted intermittently during 2003-2013. we constructed bayesian multisession capture-recapture models in stan to obtain abundance estimates for trout and regressed trend during two periods to account for variation in sampling locations. general patterns from all models indicated the population declined throughout the study. potential stressors to this system that may have contributed to the decline include whirling disease (myxobolus cerebralis), which was detected for the first time in 2016, notable floods, and release mortality. because disease and floods are largely uncontrollable from a management perspective, we suggest that stringent tactics such as angler effort restrictions may be necessary to maintain similar fisheries."
habitat specialist birds disperse farther and are more migratory than habitat generalist birds,dispersal ability; dispersal distance; dispersal syndrome; ecological specialization; habitat breadth; habitat specialization; migration; mobility; niche specialization; niche width,ECOLOGY,MARTIN AE;FAHRIG L,"some theories predict habitat specialists should be less dispersive and migratory than generalists, while other theories predict the opposite. we evaluated the cross-species relationship between the degree of habitat specialization and dispersal and migration status in 101 bird species breeding in north america and the united kingdom, using empirical estimates of the degree of habitat specialization from breeding bird surveys and mean dispersal distance estimates from large-scale mark-recapture studies. we found that habitat specialists dispersed farther than habitat generalists, and full migrants had more specialized habitat than partial migrants or resident species. to our knowledge this is the first large-scale, multi-species study to demonstrate a positive relationship between the degree of habitat specialization and dispersal, and it is opposite to the pattern found for invertebrates. this finding is particularly interesting because it suggests that trade-offs between the degree of habitat specialization and dispersal ability are not conserved across taxonomic groups. this cautions against extrapolation of trait co-occurrence from one species group to another. in particular, it suggests that efforts aimed at conserving the most habitat-specialist temperate-breeding birds will not lead to conservation of the most dispersal-limited species."
integrated modeling to estimate population size and composition of mule deer,cameras; costs; density; fecal dna; monitoring; n-mixture model; spatial capture-recapture; telemetry,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,FURNAS BJ;LANDERS RH;HILL S;ITOGA SS;SACKS BN,"estimating population size, age composition, and sex ratio of mule deer (odocoileus hemionus) is important to conservation and managed hunting of this species in the western united states. increasingly, wildlife agencies are estimating abundance of deer using fecal dna (fdna), especially in forested habitats where aerial surveys are not feasible. these same data can be used to estimate overall sex ratio but require additional data on age structure to quantify adult- and fawn-specific sex ratios, which are expected to differ substantially. we demonstrate an integrated modeling approach to estimating population sizes of adult females, adult males, and fawns from 3 sources of data: fdna, camera stations, and global positioning system (gps) telemetry. we conducted the study on an 11,500-km(2) forested region in northern california, usa, corresponding to 3 hunt management zones. within a bayesian framework, we used spatial capture-recapture (scr) modeling of fdna samples and prior information on home range sizes from telemetry to estimate sex-specific densities, and n-mixture modeling of camera detections to separate adult and fawn densities. we estimated 29,317 adult females (90% ci=24,550-34,592), 10,845 adult males (90% ci=7,778-14,858), and 19,587 fawns (90% ci=15,340-24,430) within the study area. the inclusion of telemetry increased precision of our results, and cameras provided comparable estimates of density when we calibrated them on the scr results. based on these results, we recommend a monitoring program of fdna transects repeated once every 5 years, camera stations repeated at half of transects every year, and telemetry data from 1 deer for every 2 transects on average. we estimated an average annual cost of $1,316 (u.s.) per transect to sustain this endeavor. the integration of cameras with fdna to combine age structure data with sex-specific abundance data represents a novel and significant step forward in the capacity to estimate deer population parameters.

a novel approach for estimating densities of secretive species from road-survey and spatial-movement data,abundance estimation; behaviour; heterodon simus; method; radio-telemetry; southern hognose snake,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,WILLSON JA;PITTMAN SE;BEANE JC;TUBERVILLE TA,"context. accurate estimates of population density are a critical component of effective wildlife conservation and management. however, many snake species are so secretive that their density cannot be determined using traditional methods such as capture-mark-recapture. thus, the status of most terrestrial snake populations remains completely unknown. aim. we developed a novel simulation-based technique for estimating density of secretive snakes that combined behavioural observations of snake road-crossing behaviour (crossing speed), effort-corrected road-survey data, and simulations of spatial movement patterns derived from radio-telemetry, without relying on mark recapture. methods. we used radio-telemetry data to parameterise individual-based movement models that estimate the frequency with which individual snakes cross roads and used information on survey vehicle speed and snake crossing speed to determine the probability of detecting a snake, given that it crosses the road transect during a survey. snake encounter frequencies during systematic road surveys were then interpreted in light of detection probabilities and simulation model results to estimate snake densities and to assess various factors likely to affect abundance estimates. we demonstrated the broad applicability of this approach through a case study of the imperiled southern hognose snake (heterodon simus) in the north carolina (usa) sandhills. key results. we estimated that h. simus occurs at average densities of 0.17 ha(-1) in the north carolina sandhills and explored the sensitivity of this estimate to assumptions and variation in model parameters. conclusions. our novel method allowed us to generate the first abundance estimates for h. simus. we found that h. simus exists at low densities relative to congeners and other mid-sized snake species, raising concern that this species may not only have declined in geographic range, but may also occur at low densities or be declining in their strongholds, such as the north carolina sandhills."
coping with intrasexual behavioral differences: capture-recapture abundance estimation of male cheetah,abundance; capture-recapture model; cheetah; heterogeneity; intrasexual behavioral differences,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,EDWARDS S;FISCHER M;WACHTER B;MELZHEIMER J,"population estimates are a fundamental requirement of ecology and conservation. while capture-recapture models are an established method for producing such estimates, their assumption of homogeneous capture probabilities is problematic given that heterogeneity in individual capture probability is inherent to most species. such variation must be accounted for by abundance models; otherwise, biased estimates are risked. here, we investigate the performance of four types of heterogeneity models for estimating abundance of male cheetah acinonyx jubatus, a species with two distinct spatial tactics of territorial and nonterritorial (floater) males. the differences in spatial movements of territory holders and floaters are expected to result in intrasexual heterogeneous capture probabilities. four heterogeneity models were used to model male abundance at five territories in central namibia; (a) a spatial tactic model, (b) a finite mixture model, both run in program mark, (c) a floater-only model, and (d) a heterogeneity m-h model, both run in the program capture. camera trap data of cheetah, taken at frequently visited marking trees, were used to derive true abundance. model results were compared to the true abundance to assess the accuracy of estimates. only models (a), (b), and (c) were able to consistently produce accurate results. mixture models do not require prior knowledge regarding spatial tactic of males, which might not always be available. therefore, we recommend such models as the preferred model type for cheetahs. results highlight the potential for mixture models in overcoming the challenges of capture probability heterogeneity and in particular their use with species where intrasexual behavioral differences exist."

"""in a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings"": woodlands in an agricultural matrix maintain functionality of a wintering bird community",NA,PLOS ONE,SYIEM BL;GOSWAMI VR;VASUDEVZ D,"the agricultural matrix has increasingly been recognized for its potential to supplement protected areas (pas) in biodiversity conservation. this potential is highly contextual, depending on composition and spatial configuration of matrix elements and their mechanistic relationship with biological communities. we investigate the effects of local vegetation structure, and proximity to a pa on the site-use of different guilds in a wintering bird community within the pa, and in wooded land-use types in the surrounding matrix. we used occupancy models to estimate covariate-guild relationships and predict site-use. we also compared species richness (estimated through capture-recapture models) and species naive site-use between the pa and the matrix to evaluate taxonomic changes. we found that tree cover did not limit the site-use of most guilds of the community, probably due to high canopy cover across all chosen sites. exceptions to this were guilds comprising generalist species. shrub cover and bamboo cover had important effects on some woodland-associated guilds, suggesting a change in limiting factors for site-use under adequate tree cover. site-use across the matrix was high for all analyzed guilds. this was found to be due to three non-exclusive reasons: (i) presence of one or more ubiquitous species (found all across the landscape) within some guilds, (ii) redundancy of species within guilds that buffered against a decrease in site-use, and (iii) turnover in guild composition/abundances to more generalist species from pa to matrix. estimated species richness was higher in the matrix (107 +/- 11; mean +/- se) than in the pa (90 +/- 7), which may have been in part due to the addition of generalist species in the matrix. understanding factors that limit biological communities is crucial to better managing the ever-increasing matrix for biodiversity conservation. our study provides insights into the effects of different components of vegetation structure on the bird community in wooded land-use types in the matrix. we highlight the value of woodlands surrounding pas in maintaining multiple guilds, and hence, the functionality of a wintering bird community. however, we caution that the matrix may fall short in retaining some specialized species of the community."
demographics and spatial ecology in a population of cryptic wood white butterfly leptidea juvernica in northern ireland,cryptic wood white; leptidea juvernica; pieridae; population ecology; spatial ecology; host plant distribution; butterfly conservation,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,O NEILL J;MONTGOMERY I,"the cryptic wood white leptidea juvernica is one of a newly-discovered species complex comprising three morphologically similar species in europe. in the british isles, l. juvernica is absent from great britain, but is widespread in ireland, where it has experienced recent declines; it is classed as a priority species in northern ireland. using a mark-recapture approach, this study aims to elucidate the population and spatial ecology of l. juvernica based on a population resident on a small, suburban site and to propose conservation measures. the results demonstrated that populations of l. juvernica, even on small sites, can reach high numbers during the peak flight season. unusually for european pieridae, there was only weak evidence of protandry in this population, possibly reflecting weather conditions prior to the flight season. the spatial distribution and abundance of l. juvernica was associated with the distribution of its larval host-plants, as well as maintaining close proximity to south-facing habitat edges for shelter. males had a closer association to sheltered habitat edges, whilst females were found more commonly on open ground with a shorter sward which was the preferred egg-laying habitat. long vegetation in sheltered areas was important for roosting during periods of non-activity. these results inform conservation measures which will benefit l. juvernica; appropriate measures focus on habitat management providing a mosaic of open, semi-natural grassland interspersed with tall vegetation, scrub, and trees."
reproductive habitat provisioning promotes survival and reproduction of the endangered endemic damselfly calopteryx exul,conservation; restoration; oviposition; odonates; plants; oviposition; algeria,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,MELLAL MK;BENSOUILAH M;HOUHAMDI M;KHELIFA R,"effective habitat management is predicted to have positive effects on populations and species of conservation concern. although studies have shown that ecological processes such as colonization can be promoted after habitat management, we still need more information on the survival and reproductive consequences at the individual level in order to reach positive conservation outcome. here we assess the effects of reproductive habitat supplementation (host oviposition plant) on survival and mating success of an endangered endemic damselfly, calopteryx exul, using capture-mark-recapture data. we first determined that the species prefer to oviposit on floating leaves of potamogeton spp. based on cormack-jolly-seber modeling, we found that recapture and survival probabilities were positively affected by the number of the host oviposition patches of the host plant. moreover, we showed a strong positive relationship between adult lifespan and lifetime mating success. our results suggest that host-plant provisioning for reproduction not only increases the survival of individuals, but also increases the number of matings per lifetime. the procedure of supplying reproductive sites may enhance population growth of threatened odonates and other aquatic insects."
mortality of mule deer fawns in a natural gas development area,anthropogenic disturbances; colorado; mule deer; natural gas development; odocoileus hemionus; population dynamics; predation; survival,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,PETERSON ME;ANDERSON CR;NORTHRUP JM;DOHERTY PF,"recent natural gas development has caused concern among wildlife managers, researchers, and stakeholders over the potential effects on wildlife and their habitats. specifically, understanding how this development and other factors influence mule deer (odocoileus hemionus) fawn (i.e., 0-6 months old) mortality rates, recruitment, and subsequently population dynamics have been identified as knowledge gaps. thus, we tested predictions concerning the relationship between natural gas development, adult female, fawn birth, and temporal (weather) characteristics on fawn mortality in the piceance basin of northwestern colorado, usa, from 2012-2014. we captured and radio-collared 184 fawns and estimated apparent cause-specific mortality in areas with relatively high or low levels of natural gas development using a multi-state model. mean daily predation probability was similar in the high versus low development areas. predation was the leading cause of fawn mortality in both areas and decreased from 0-14 days old. black bear (ursus americanus; 22% of all mortalities, n=17) and cougar (felis concolor; 36% of all mortalities, n=6) predation was the leading cause of mortality in the high and low development areas, respectively. predation of fawns was negatively correlated with the distance from a female's core area to a producing well pad on winter or summer range. contrary to expectations, predation of fawns was positively correlated with rump fat thickness of adult females. well pad densities and development activity were relatively low during our study, indicating that the observed intensity of development did not appear to influence daily predation probability. our results suggest maintaining development activity thresholds at levels we observed to potentially minimize the effects of development on fawn mortality. however, we caution that higher development intensity and drilling activity in flatter, less rugged areas with less concealment cover could influence fawn mortality. managers should maintain low development densities in areas where topography and vegetation offer less concealment. overall, region-specific data (e.g., development intensity, topography, predator assemblages, and associated predation risk) are needed to better understand the effects of natural gas development on fawn mortality.

"sunning themselves in heaps, knots, and snarls: the extraordinary abundance and demography of island watersnakes",body size; capture-mark-recapture; life history; population estimation; process variance; realized population growth; survival; vital rates,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,KING RB;STANFORD KM;JONES PC,"snakes represent a sizable fraction of vertebrate biodiversity, but until recently, data on their demography have been sparse. consequently, generalizations regarding patterns of variation are weak and the potential for population projections is limited. we address this information gap through an analysis of spatial and temporal variation in demography (population size, annual survival, and realized population growth) of the lake erie watersnake, nerodia sipedon insularum, and a review of snake survival more generally. our study spans a period during which the lake erie watersnake was listed as threatened under the u.s. endangered species act, recovered, and was delisted. we collected capture-mark-recapture data at 14 study sites over 20years, accruing 20,000 captures of 13,800 individually marked adults. lake erie watersnakes achieve extraordinary abundance, averaging 520adults per km of shoreline (ca. 260adult per ha) at our study sites (range=160-1,600adults per km; ca. 80-800adults per ha) and surpassing population recovery and postdelisting monitoring criteria. annual survival averages 0.68 among adult females and 0.76 among adult males, varies among sites, and is positively correlated with body size among study sites. temporal process variance in annual survival is low, averaging 0.0011 or less than 4% of total variance; thus, stochasticity in annual survival may be of minor significance to snake extinction risk. estimates of realized population growth indicate that population size has been stable or increasing over the course of our study. more generally, snake annual survival overlaps broadly across continents, climate zones, families, subfamilies, reproductive modes, body size categories, maturation categories, and parity categories. differences in survival in relation to size, parity, and maturation are in the directions predicted by life history theory but are of small magnitude with much variation around median values. overall, annual survival appears to be quite plastic, varying with food availability, habitat quality, and other ecological variables."
reducing effects of dispersal on the bias of 2-sample mark-recapture estimators of stream fish abundance,NA,PLOS ONE,MCNAIR JN;RUETZ CR;CARLSON A;SUH J,"the 2-sample mark-recapture method with chapman's estimator is often used by inland fishery managers to estimate the reach-scale abundance of stream fish. an important assumption of this method is that no dispersal into or out of the study reach occurs between the two samples. violations of this assumption are probably common in practice, but their effect on bias (systematic error) of abundance estimates is poorly understood, especially in small populations. estimation methods permitting dispersal exist but, for logistical reasons, often are infeasible for routine assessments in streams. the purpose of this paper is to extend available results regarding effects of dispersal on the bias of chapman's estimator as applied to reach-scale studies of stream fish abundance. we examine for the first time the joint effects of dispersal and sampling variation on the bias of this estimator. to reduce the bias effects of dispersal, we propose a modified sampling scheme in which the original study reach is expanded, a central subreach is sampled during the mark session (sample 1), and the entire reach is sampled during the recapture session (sample 2). this modified sampling scheme can substantially reduce bias effects of dispersal without requiring unique marking of individual fish or additional site visits. analytical and simulation results show that sampling variation tends to create negative bias with respect to study-reach abundance, while dispersal tends to create positive bias; the net effect can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the true abundance, capture probabilities, and amount and nature of dispersal. in most cases, simply expanding the study reach is an effective way to reduce dispersal-related bias of chapman's estimator, but expanding the study reach and employing the modified sampling scheme we propose is a better alternative for accurately estimating abundance with the same level of sampling effort."

"spatio-temporal migratory dynamics of jasus frontalis (milne edwards, 1837) in alexander selkirk island, juan fernandez archipelago, chile",NA,PLOS ONE,ROMAN C;ERNST B;THIEL M;MANRIQUEZ P;CHAMORRO J,"knowledge about the spatial patterns and movements of crustaceans has gained importance since the creation of marine protected areas and the development of spatial management for benthic ecosystems. the juan fernandez spiny lobster (jasus frontalis) is an endemic marine species and most valuable resource that exhibits migratory dynamics in a highly spatially regulated fishery. to study movement patterns around alexander selkirk island, a mark-recapture program was implemented in 2008, when approximately 7000 non-commercial (undersized) lobsters were tagged and followed for nearly 14 months. using quantitative georeferenced data, this study revealed spatial structuring of juan fernandez spiny lobster and tested hypotheses about alongshore and inshore-offshore movements. eight clusters were identified around alexander selkirk island, with moderate time-varying connectivity between them. seasonal inshore-offshore movements were detected all around the island, but more conspicuously to the north. average travelling distance was 1.2 km (1.7 sd). our results confirmed that towards the end of austral spring males and females embark in a seasonal offshore migration to deeper waters, returning to shallower waters only during winter. these findings quantitatively consolidate the conceptual migratory model that local fishermen had already inferred for this resource from about a century of sustainable fishing."
challenges of implementing mark-recapture studies on poorly marked gregarious delphinids,NA,PLOS ONE,HUPMAN K;STOCKIN KA;POLLOCK K;PAWLEY MDM;DWYER SL;LEA C;TEZANOS PINTO G,"population parameters of poorly marked gregarious species are difficult to estimate. this is the case for common dolphins (delphinus sp.), a genus known for its lack of distinctive marks resulting in a low mark ratio. furthermore, the widespread nature of common dolphins results in low recaptures. we developed reliable photo-identification protocols to ensure accurate identification of individuals in the hauraki gulf, new zealand. these protocols combined the use of nicks and notches and pigmentation patterns for identification and included the development of a distinctiveness threshold. the data were further stratified by the level of distinctiveness of each individual (as distinctive or highly-distinctive). photo-identification surveys were conducted from january 2010 to december 2013. mark-recapture techniques were implemented through a popan super-population approach to estimate seasonal apparent survival, capture probability and abundance of dolphins. a total of 2,083 unique adult common dolphins were identified, 51.3% were classified as d1 (highly distinctive; n = 1,069) and 48.7% as d2 (distinctive; n = 1,014). of all individuals identified, 34.3% (n = 704) were re-sighted over subsequent years. the proportion of marked dolphins (when compared to unmarked dolphins) was 26.3% for d1 and 46.4% for d1 & d2, respectively. apparent survival was estimated at 0.767 (ci = 0.694-0.827) for d1 animals, and 0.796 (ci = 0.729-0.850) for d1 & d2 combined. for d1 only, seasonal abundance varied from 732 (ci = 460-1,177) in autumn 2010 to 5,304 (ci = 4,745-5,930) in spring 2013. while the inclusion of d2 individuals may offer a more precise estimate of total abundance, the inability to determine additional sources of bias (for example, arising from under or overestimated mark ratios) meant that estimates for d1 individuals were deemed the least biased for this population. the photo-identification protocol, stratification of the data and steps taken to eliminate potential model violations provided a useful and novel approach to estimate population parameters for common dolphins. these approaches could be implemented for other large gregarious populations (>= 500 individuals) of animals with poor natural markings."
large-scale movements of postcopulatory female blue crabs callinectes sapidus in tidal and nontidal estuaries of north carolina,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,DARNELL MZ;KEMBERLING AA,"for migratory species, understanding the timing, direction, and mechanism of migration is critical for successful fisheries management. we investigated migratory movements of postcopulatory female blue crabs callinectes sapidus in three estuaries with different tidal regimes in north carolina using a mark-recapture study. all crabs tagged were within about 2weeks of the terminal molt to maturity (mating generally takes place immediately after the molt). in general, distances traveled (mean +/- se=6.8 +/- 0.6km) and net movement rates (0.5 +/- 0.05km/d) were quite low compared to those in previous studies of mature (but not necessarily recently molted) female crabs, suggesting that rapid seaward migration does not take place until several weeks after mating, presumably upon production of a clutch of eggs. although most crabs moved short distances (85% moved<15km), movement was generally oriented seaward, indicating that some down-estuary movement occurs prior to oviposition, especially in crabs mating in low-salinity estuaries that would be unsuitable for embryonic and larval development. crabs moving seaward in the weeks between molting/mating and first oviposition were likely walking rather than swimming and taking advantage of seaward currents, as indicated by the low movement rates and similarities among the three areas."
multiple anthropogenic interventions drive puma survival following wolf recovery in the greater yellowstone ecosystem,apex predators; biodiversity; competition; hunting; population dynamics; reintroductions,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ELBROCH LM;MARESCOT L;QUIGLEY H;CRAIGHEAD D;WITTMER HU,"humans are primary drivers of declining abundances and extirpation of large carnivores worldwide. management interventions to restore biodiversity patterns, however, include carnivore reintroductions, despite the many unresolved ecological consequences associated with such efforts. using multistate capture-mark-recapture models, we explored age-specific survival and cause-specific mortality rates for 134 pumas (puma concolor) monitored in the greater yellowstone ecosystem during gray wolf (canis lupus) recovery. we identified two top models explaining differences in puma survivorship, and our results suggested three management interventions (unsustainable puma hunting, reduction in a primary prey, and reintroduction of a dominant competitor) have unintentionally impacted puma survival. specifically, puma survival across age classes was lower in the 6-month hunting season than the 6-month nonhunting season; human-caused mortality rates for juveniles and adults, and predation rates on puma kittens, were higher in the hunting season. predation on puma kittens, and starvation rates for all pumas, also increased as managers reduced elk (cervus elaphus) abundance in the system, highlighting direct and indirect effects of competition between recovering wolves and pumas over prey. our results emphasize the importance of understanding the synergistic effects of existing management strategies and the recovery of large, dominant carnivores to effectively conserve subordinate, hunted carnivores in human-dominated landscapes."
"efficacy of low-cost, side-scan sonar for surveying alligator gars",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,FLEMING BP;DAUGHERTY DJ;SMITH NG;BETSILL RK,"side-scan sonar (sss) provides an efficient, nonintrusive sampling tool for many fisheries applications. professional-grade systems have proven useful for species-specific detection of large, distinctive fishes; however, these systems are often cost prohibitive for widespread use. lower-cost, consumer-grade systems are becoming increasingly popular for fisheries applications and have been used extensively to map aquatic habitat. however, these systems often produce lower-resolution imagery that may limit species-specific applications. we used experimental ponds stocked with known fish assemblages and a field-based mark-recapture study to determine the efficacy of a consumer-grade sss system in surveying alligator gars atractosteus spatula. three ponds were stocked with known abundances of alligator gars and other sympatric fishes. a fourth pond remained unstocked to assess false positives; a fifth was stocked only with other species to quantify misidentification. replicate sonar images of each pond were then recorded using a humminbird 998c system. for the field-based application, we used gill nets to mark and recapture alligator gars and estimate population size within a closed backwater of the guadalupe river, texas. following final recapture, we recorded replicate imagery of the backwater. imagery from both evaluations was interpreted by three independent readers of varying experience without knowledge of image origin. the results from the ponds indicated a low rate of false detection (7%) and misidentification (4%). the number of alligator gars identified was positively related to density; however, the probability of detection varied among readers (range, 0.27-0.71) and was positively related to experience. in contrast, all readers estimated alligator gar abundance in the backwater within 10% of the population estimated from the mark-recapture data. our results suggest that low-cost sss can provide an effective, noninvasive alternative to traditional sampling techniques for alligator gars."
efficient single-survey estimation of carnivore density using fecal dna and spatial capture-recapture: a bobcat case study,felid conservation; lynx rufus; multistrata spatial capture-recapture; noninvasive genetic sampling; population density; scat transects,POPULATION ECOLOGY,MORIN DJ;WAITS LP;MCNITT DC;KELLY MJ,"population density estimates are necessary to inform management and conservation, yet are difficult to obtain for cryptic species such as carnivores, and often require intensive sampling. we implemented a single-survey, closed session, scat sampling protocol to estimate bobcat density using fecal dna and spatial capture-recapture at two sites over five sessions in virginia, usa. we employed a poisson encounter model to allow for multiple detections on scat transect segments over a single collection interval, and compared single session and multistrata (closed, multi-site, multisession) spatial capture-recapture (scr) approaches to estimate density for each site and session. we found improved precision for most estimates using the multistrata scr approach, sharing data on baseline detection and individual movement across sites and sessions. we suggest the summer session estimates are representative of the resident population, that differences in density between summer and winter are representative of potential net recruitment, and that differences between consecutive summer sessions are representative of the net recruitment realized for the population (dependent on survival and emigration). finally, we assessed factors affecting precision in single session model estimates and provide recommendations to improve detection and reduce credible intervals that may be applicable across the bobcat range and to other carnivore species. the single survey transect methodology provides flexibility in monitoring carnivore populations specifically, or as part of concurrent monitoring for multiple carnivore species. this methodology has potential to dramatically increase the effectiveness of conservation and management dollars, improving our ability to monitor carnivore populations and assess conservation needs and actions."

n-mix for fish: estimating riverine salmonid habitat selection via n-mixture models,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,SOM NA;PERRY RW;JONES EC;DE JUILIO K;PETROS P;PINNIX WD;RUPERT DL,"models that formulate mathematical linkages between fish use and habitat characteristics are applied for many purposes. for riverine fish, these linkages are often cast as resource selection functions with variables including depth and velocity of water and distance to nearest cover. ecologists are now recognizing the role that detection plays in observing organisms, and failure to account for imperfect detection can lead to spurious inference. herein, we present a flexible n-mixture model to associate habitat characteristics with the abundance of riverine salmonids that simultaneously estimates detection probability. our formulation has the added benefits of accounting for demographics variation and can generate probabilistic statements regarding intensity of habitat use. in addition to the conceptual benefits, model application to data from the trinity river, california, yields interesting results. detection was estimated to vary among surveyors, but there was little spatial or temporal variation. additionally, a weaker effect of water depth on resource selection is estimated than that reported by previous studies not accounting for detection probability. n-mixture models show great promise for applications to riverine resource selection."

hierarchical bayesian estimation of unobserved salmon passage through weirs,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,JASPER JR;SHORT M;SHELDEN C;GRANT WS,"we developed a hierarchical bayesian model (hbm) to estimate missing counts of chinook salmon (oncorhynchus tshawytscha (walbaum in artedi, 1792)) at a weir on the kogrukluk river, alaska, between 1976 and 2015. the model assumed that fish passage during a breach of the weir was typical of passage during normal operations. counts of fish passing the weir were missing for some days during the runs, or only partial counts for a given 24-hour period were available. the hbm approach provided more defensible estimates of missing data and total escapement than ad hoc or year-by-year model estimates, because estimates of passage for a given year were informed not only by counts for the current year, but also by counts for all previous years. the results of the hbm yielded less variable estimates of escapement than did ad hoc or year-by-year model estimates. the hbm represents a standardized approach to estimate missing counts and total escapement and eliminates the need for ad hoc estimates of missing counts. the model also provides managers with a measure of uncertainty around estimates of escapement and around estimates of hyper-parameters to define run curves in subsequent years with incomplete fish counts."
on the robustness of n-mixture models,abundance estimation; bayesian p-value; count data; detection probability; n-mixture model; robustness,ECOLOGY,LINK WA;SCHOFIELD MR;BARKER RJ;SAUER JR,"n-mixture models provide an appealing alternative to mark-recapture models, in that they allow for estimation of detection probability and population size from count data, without requiring that individual animals be identified. there is, however, a cost to using the n-mixture models: inference is very sensitive to the model's assumptions. we consider the effects of three violations of assumptions that might reasonably be expected in practice: double counting, unmodeled variation in population size over time, and unmodeled variation in detection probability over time. these three examples show that small violations of assumptions can lead to large biases in estimation. the violations of assumptions we consider are not only small qualitatively, but are also small in the sense that they are unlikely to be detected using goodness-of-fit tests. in cases where reliable estimates of population size are needed, we encourage investigators to allocate resources to acquiring additional data, such as recaptures of marked individuals, for estimation of detection probabilities."
linking demographic processes and foraging ecology in wandering albatross-conservation implications,capture-mark-recapture; diomedea exulans; population dynamics; vital rates,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,WEIMERSKIRCH H,"1. population dynamics and foraging ecology are two fields of the population ecology that are generally studied separately. yet, foraging determines allocation processes and therefore demography. studies on wandering albatrosses diomedea exulans over the past 50years have contributed to better understand the links between population dynamics and foraging ecology. this article reviews how these two facets of population ecology have been combined to better understand ecological processes, but also have contributed fundamentally for the conservation of this long-lived threatened species. 2. wandering albatross research has combined a 50-year long-term study of marked individuals with two decades of tracking studies that have been initiated on this species, favoured by its large size and tameness. 3. at all stages of their life history, the body mass of individuals plays a central role in allocation processes, in particular in influencing adult and juvenile survival, decisions to recruit into the population or to invest into provisioning the offspring or into maintenance. 4. strong age-related variations in demographic parameters are observed and are linked to age-related differences in foraging distribution and efficiency. marked sex-specific differences in foraging distribution, foraging efficiency and changes in mass over lifetime are directly related to the strong sex-specific investment in breeding and survival trajectories of the two sexes, with body mass playing a pivotal role especially in males. 5. long-term study has allowed determining the sex-specific and age-specific demographic causes of population decline, and the tracking studies have been able to derive where and how these impacts occur, in particular the role of long-line fisheries."
eastern massasauga demography and extinction risk under prescribed-fire scenarios,abundance; age-specific survival; eastern massasauga (sistrurus catenatus); extinction; litter size; michigan; prescribed fire; reproductive frequency,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,HILEMAN ET;KING RB;FAUST LJ,"the use of poorly estimated or surrogate population parameter estimates to assess population viability may result in misleading predictions. consequently, a critical first step to understanding population health and the effects of land management practices on threatened species is estimation of site-specific demographic parameters. a major threat to the eastern massasauga (sistrurus catenatus) is habitat loss due to encroachment of woody vegetation and invasive species. current land management practices require periodic burning or mowing to maintain habitat suitability. although these methods improve habitat quality, they may also increase the risk of depredation due to reduced ground cover if burns are too extensive or cause mortality if conducted when snakes are active. we fitted contemporary capture-recapture and matrix models to an 8-year dataset to estimate population parameters for an eastern massasauga population near the range center of the species, where the largest number of eastern massasauga populations may still persist. from 2009 to 2016, we captured 826 eastern massasaugas 1,776 times. in general, annual survival increased with increasing age (age 0=0.38, age 1=0.65, age 2=0.67, age 3 females=0.71, age 3 males=0.66). abundance estimates ranged from 84 to 140 adults and annual reproductive frequency was 0.44 (95% ci=0.29-0.59). we simulated increased mortality due to prescribed burns during spring, fall, and late fall for 50 and 100 years. the baseline model, which incorporated current prescribed-fire practices, indicated a stable population with only a 0.2-0.6% probability of extinction over 100 years, suggesting that management practices at this site are sustainable if they remain unchanged. simulations of conservative increases in mortality due to fire changed the probability of extinction little over 50 years (0.7%) but increased probability of extinction up to 24.5% over 100 years in the most pessimistic prescribed-burn scenario. these prescribed-burn simulations may be comparable to burn regimes used at other eastern massasauga sites. the population parameters estimated here provide information needed for assessing range-wide population viability and investigating geographic variation in eastern massasauga demography. (c) 2018 the wildlife society. we estimated a suite of eastern massasauga population parameters using an 8-year capture-recapture dataset and simulated the effects prescribed fire during spring, fall, and late fall had on extinction risk. these prescribed fire scenarios, which may be comparable to burn regimes used by other land managers, changed the probability of extinction little over 50 years (0.7%) but increased probability of extinction up to 24.5% over 100 years in the most pessimistic scenario."
spatial capture-recapture design and modelling for the study of small mammals,NA,PLOS ONE,ROMAIRONE J;JIMENEZ J;LUQUE LARENA JJ;MOUGEOT F,"spatial capture-recapture modelling (scr) is a powerful analytical tool to estimate density and derive information on space use and behaviour of elusive animals. yet, scr has been seldom applied to the study of ecologically keystone small mammals. here we highlight its potential and requirements with a case study on common voles (microtus arvalis). first, we address mortality associated with live-trapping, which can be high in small mammals, and must be kept minimal. we designed and tested a nest box coupled with a classic sherman trap and show that it allows a 5-fold reduction of mortality in traps. second, we address the need to adjust the trapping grid to the individual home range to maximize spatial recaptures. in may-june 2016, we captured and tagged with transponders 227 voles in a 1.2-ha area during two monthly sessions. using a bayesian scr with a multinomial approach, we estimated: (1) the baseline detection rate and investigated variation according to sex, time or behaviour (aversion/attraction after a previous capture); (2) the parameter sigma that describes how detection probability declines as a function of the distance to an individual's activity centre, and investigated variation according to sex; and (3) density and population sex-ratio. we show that reducing the maximum distance between traps from 12 to 9.6m doubled spatial recaptures and improved model predictions. baseline detection rate increased over time (after overcoming a likely aversion to entering new odourless traps) and was greater for females than males in june. the sigma parameter of males was twice that of females, indicating larger home ranges. density estimates were of 142.92 +/- 38.50 and 168.25 +/- 15.79 voles/ha in may and june, respectively, with 2-3 times more females than males. we highlight the potential and broad applicability that scr offers and provide specific recommendations for using it to study small mammals like voles."
identifying individual cougars (puma concolor) in remote camera images - implications for population estimates,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,ALEXANDER PD;GESE EM,"context several studies have estimated cougar (puma concolor) abundance using remote camera trapping in conjunction with capture-mark-recapture (cmr) type analyses. however, this methodology (photo-cmr) requires that photo-captured individuals are individually recognisable (photo identification). photo identification is generally achieved using naturally occurring marks (e.g. stripes or spots) that are unique to each individual. cougars, however, are uniformly pelaged, and photo identification must be based on subtler attributes such as scars, ear nicks or body morphology. there is some debate as to whether these types of features are sufficient for photo-cmr, but there is little research directly evaluating its feasibility with cougars. aim we aimed to examine researchers' ability to reliably identify individual cougars in photographs taken from a camera-trapping survey, in order to evaluate the appropriateness of photo-cmr for estimating cougar abundance or cmr-derived parameters. methods we collected cougar photo detections using a grid of 55 remote camera traps in north-west wyoming, usa. the photo detections were distributed to professional biologists working in cougar research, who independently attempted to identify individuals in a pairwise matching process. we assessed the level to which their results agreed, using simple percentage agreement and fleiss's kappa. we also generated and compared spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) density estimates using their resultant detection histories. key results there were no cases where participants were in full agreement on a cougar's id. agreement in photo identification among participants was low (n=7; simple agreement=46.7%; fleiss's kappa=0.183). the resultant secr density estimates ranged from 0.7 to 13.5 cougars per 100km(2) (n=4; s.d.=6.11). conclusion we were unable to produce reliable estimates of cougar density using photo-cmr, due to our inability to accurately photo-tag detected individuals. abundance estimators that do not require complete photo-tagging (i.e. mark-resight) were also infeasible, given the lack of agreement on any single cougar's id. implications this research suggested that there are substantial problems with the application of photo-cmr to estimate the size of cougar populations. although improvements in camera technology or field methods may resolve these issues, researchers attempting to use this method on cougars should be cautious."
"integrated analysis for population estimation, management impact evaluation, and decision-making for a declining species",bayesian inference; diamondback terrapin; mark-recapture; multistate model; population viability analysis; road mortality,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,CRAWFORD BA;MOORE CT;NORTON TM;MAERZ JC,"a challenge for making conservation decisions is predicting how wildlife populations respond to multiple, concurrent threats and potential management strategies, usually under substantial uncertainty. integrated modeling approaches can improve estimation of demographic rates necessary for making predictions, even for rare or cryptic species with sparse data, but their use in management applications is limited. we developed integrated models for a population of diamondback terrapins (malaclemys terrapin) impacted by road-associated threats to (i) jointly estimate demographic rates from two mark-recapture datasets, while directly estimating road mortality and the impact of management actions deployed during the study; and (ii) project the population using population viability analysis under simulated management strategies to inform decision-making. without management, population extirpation was nearly certain due to demographic impacts of road mortality, predators, and vegetation. installation of novel flashing signage increased survival of terrapins that crossed roads by 30%. signage, along with small roadside barriers installed during the study, increased population persistence probability, but the population was still predicted to decline. management strategies that included actions targeting multiple threats and demographic rates resulted in the highest persistence probability, and roadside barriers, which increased adult survival, were predicted to increase persistence more than other actions. our results support earlier findings showing mitigation of multiple threats is likely required to increase the viability of declining populations. our approach illustrates how integrated models may be adapted to use limited data efficiently, represent system complexity, evaluate impacts of threats and management actions, and provide decision-relevant information for conservation of at-risk populations."
estimating the completeness of death registration: an empirical method,NA,PLOS ONE,ADAIR T;LOPEZ AD,"introduction many national and subnational governments need to routinely measure the completeness of death registration for monitoring and statistical purposes. existing methods, such as death distribution and capture-recapture methods, have a number of limitations such as inaccuracy and complexity that prevent widespread application. this paper presents a novel empirical method to estimate completeness of death registration at the national and subnational level. methods random-effects models to predict the logit of death registration completeness were developed from 2,451 country-years in 110 countries from 1970 +/- 2015 using the global burden of disease 2015 database. predictors include the registered crude death rate, under-five mortality rate, population age structure and under-five death registration completeness. models were developed separately for males, females and both sexes. findings all variables are highly significant and reliably predict completeness of registration across a wide range of registered crude death rates (r-squared 0.85). mean error is highest at medium levels of observed completeness. the models show quite close agreement between predicted and observed completeness for populations outside the dataset. there is high concordance with the hybrid death distribution method in brazilian states. uncertainty in the under-five mortality rate, assessed using the dataset and in colombian departmentos, has minimal impact on national level predicted completeness, but a larger effect at the subnational level. conclusions the method demonstrates sufficient flexibility to predict a wide range of completeness levels at a given registered crude death rate. the method can be applied utilising data readily available at the subnational level, and can be used to assess completeness of deaths reported from health facilities, censuses and surveys. its utility is diminished where the adult mortality rate is unusually high for a given under-five mortality rate. the method overcomes the considerable limitations of existing methods and has considerable potential for widespread application by national and subnational governments."

estimating dispersal in spatiotemporally variable environments using multievent capture-recapture modeling,capture-recapture; dispersal; dynamic landscapes; metapopulation; multi-event models; survival,ECOLOGY,CAYUELA H;PRADEL R;JOLY P;BONNAIRE E;BESNARD A,"dispersal is a key process in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. spatiotemporal variation in habitat availability and characteristics has been suggested to be one of the main cause involved in dispersal evolution and has a strong influence on metapopulation dynamics. in recent decades, the study of dispersal has led to the development of capture-recapture (cr) models that allow movement between sites to be quantified, while handling imperfect detection. for studies involving numerous recapture sites, lagrange et al. (2014) proposed a multievent cr model that allows dispersal to be estimated while omitting site identity by distinguishing between individuals that stay and individuals that move. more recently, cayuela et al. (2017) extended this model to allow survival and dispersal probabilities to differ for the different types of habitat represented by several sites within a study area. yet in both of these modeling systems, the state of sites is assumed to be static over time, which is not a realistic assumption in dynamic landscapes. for that purpose, we generalized the multievent cr model proposed by cayuela et al. (2017) to allow the estimation of dispersal, survival and recapture probabilities when a site may appear or disappear over time (model 1) or when the characteristics of a site fluctuate over space and time (model 2). this paper first presents these two new modeling systems, and then provides an illustration of their efficacy and usefulness by applying them to simulated cr data and data collected on two metapopulations of amphibians. model 1 was tested using cr data recorded on a metapopulation of yellow-bellied toads (bombina variegata). in this first empirical case, we examined whether the drying-out dynamics of ponds and the past dispersal status of an individual might affect dispersal behavior. our study revealed that the probability of facultative dispersal (i.e., from a pond group that remained available/flooded) fluctuated between years and was higher in individuals that had previously dispersed. model 2 was tested using cr data collected on a metapopulation of great crested newts (triturus cristatus). in this second empirical example, we investigated whether the density of alpine newts (ichthyosaura alpestris), a potential competitor, might affect the dispersal and survival of the crested newt. our study revealed that the departure rate was lower in ponds with a high density of heterospecifics than in ponds with a low density of heterospecifics at both inter-annual and intra-annual scales. moreover, annual survival was slightly higher in ponds with a high density of heterospecifics. overall, our findings indicate that these multievent cr models provide a highly flexible means of modeling dispersal in dynamic landscapes."

estimating mortality rates among passerines caught for ringing with mist nets using data from previously ringed birds,avian; bird ringing; injury; mark-recapture; mortality; passerine; trapping; welfare,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CLEWLEY GD;ROBINSON RA;CLARK JA,"mist netting is the most commonly used method for catching birds for scientific ringing, but despite decades of use, there have been few attempts to quantify the associated potential risks to the individuals caught. any incidence of mortality through capture and handling, however low, is of potential ethical concern and may also introduce biases into the data. we estimate the mortality rate associated with capture of previously ringed (recaptured) passerines from the british and irish ringing scheme (c. 1.5 million records) caught using mist nets. the importance of species, age, mass, month, time, previous captures, and an index of predator occurrence was tested using generalized linear mixed-effects models. the average mortality rate was 0.0011, most of which was reported to occur before the individuals had been extracted from the nets (c. 70% of incidents). juveniles appeared to be at higher risk and the incidence of predation from mist nets was seasonal, with increased risk during the winter. species differed in their reported mortality rates with the apparent risk being greatest for chiffchaff phylloscopus collybita (0.0029) and bullfinch pyrrhula pyrrhula (0.0027). to improve our understanding (and hence minimize risk in future), we recommend collecting more complete data on incidences of mortality, and also injuries; exercising increased care when the species we have identified as being at greater risk are likely to be captured, and ensuring there are robust procedures for the checking of nets (as most reported incidents of mortality occur before handling). we also recommend that all ringing schemes should collate and make available data on capture-related mortality. overall rates of mortality associated with capture, although, were low and support the use of mist netting as a safe capture technique, without undue bias from mortality, when used by appropriately trained individuals."
effects of flow-related variables on oversummer survival of juvenile coho salmon in intermittent streams,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,OBEDZINSKI M;PIERCE SN;HORTON GE;DEITCH MJ,"while many studies have established the importance of streamflow as a driver of fish population dynamics, few have examined relationships between survival of juvenile salmonids and flow-related variables in intermittent streams. with predictions for a higher frequency of drought conditions due to climate change and the associated increasing human demand for water during the dry season, understanding fish-flow relationships is becoming increasingly important for the protection of sensitive aquatic species. to examine the effects of low streamflow on juvenile salmonids rearing in small intermittent streams, we estimated survival and collected environmental data in four coastal california watersheds from 2011 to 2013. we used an individual-based mark-recapture modeling approach to evaluate the influence of flow-related variables on oversummer survival of pit-tagged juvenile coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch stocked into eight stream reaches. survival was positively associated with streamflow magnitude, wetted volume, and dissolved oxygen and negatively associated with days of disconnected surface flow (days of disconnection) and temperature. days of disconnection best explained survival, though the relationship varied by geomorphic reach type. survival was lower in alluvial reaches than in bedrock and clay reaches and showed a faster rate of decline with increasing days of disconnection and drought condition. in all reaches, the onset of pool disconnection represented a turning point at which water quality, water quantity, and survival declined. for this reason, we suggest that days of disconnection (or the flow magnitude at which pools become disconnected) is a useful metric for identifying flow-impaired reaches, informing streamflow protection strategies, and prioritizing streamflow enhancement efforts designed to benefit sensitive salmonid populations in intermittent streams."

pacific decadal and el nino oscillations shape survival of a seabird,capture-mark-recapture methods; climatic oscillations; cost of reproduction; el nino southern oscillation; pacific decadal oscillation; seabirds; survival,ECOLOGY,CHAMPAGNON J;LEBRETON JD;DRUMMOND H;ANDERSON DJ,"understanding and modeling population change is urgently needed to predict effects of climate change on biodiversity. high trophic-level organisms are influenced by fluctuations of prey quality and abundance, which themselves may depend on climate oscillations. modeling effects of such fluctuations is challenging because prey populations may vary with multiple climate oscillations occurring at different time scales. the analysis of a 28-yr time series of capture-recapture data of a tropical seabird, the nazca booby (sula granti), in the galapagos, ecuador, allowed us to test for demographic effects of two major ocean oscillations occurring at distinct time-scales: the inter-annual el nino southern oscillation (enso) and inter-decadal oscillations. as expected for a tropical seabird, survival of fledgling birds was highly affected by extreme enso events; by contrast, neither recruitment nor breeding participation were affected by either enso or decadal oscillations. more interesting, adult survival, a demographic trait that canalizes response to environmental variations, was unaffected by inter-annual enso oscillations yet was shaped by the pacific decadal oscillation and small pelagic fish regime. adult survival decreased during oceanic conditions associated with higher breeding success, an association probably mediated in this species by costs of reproduction that reduce survival when breeding attempts end later. to our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting that survival of a vertebrate can be vulnerable to a natural multidecadal oscillation."

effects of habitat quality and access management on the density of a recovering grizzly bear population,access management; connectivity; environmental change; grizzly bear; human-impacted systems; large carnivore; mortality; recolonisation; road density; spatially explicit capture-recapture,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,LAMB CT;MOWAT G;REID A;SMIT L;PROCTOR M;MCLELLAN BN;NIELSEN SE;BOUTIN S,"1. human activities have dramatic effects on the distribution and abundance of wildlife. increased road densities and human presence in wilderness areas have elevated human-caused mortality of grizzly bears and reduced bears' use. management agencies frequently attempt to reduce human-caused mortality by managing road density and thus human access, but the effectiveness of these actions is rarely assessed. 2. we combined systematic, dna-based mark-recapture techniques with spatially explicit capture-recapture models to estimate population size of a threatened grizzly bear population (kettle-granby), following management actions to recover this population. we tested the effects of habitat and road density on grizzly bear population density. we tested both a linear and threshold-based road density metric and investigated the effect of current access management (closing roads to the public). 3. we documented an c. 50% increase in bear density since 1997 suggesting increased landscape and species conservation from management agencies played a significant role in that increase. however, bear density was lower where road densities exceeded 0.6 km/km(2) and higher where motorised vehicle access had been restricted. the highest bear densities were in areas with large tracts of few or no roads and high habitat quality. access management bolstered bear density in small areas by 27%. 4. synthesis and applications. our spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis demonstrates that population recovery is possible in a multi-use landscape when management actions target priority areas. we suggest that road density is a useful surrogate for the negative effects of human land use on grizzly bear populations, but spatial configuration of roads must still be considered. reducing roads will increase grizzly bear density, but restricting vehicle access can also achieve this goal. we demonstrate that a policy target of reducing human access by managing road density below 0.6 km/km(2), while ensuring areas of high habitat quality have no roads, is a reasonable compromise between the need for road access and population recovery goals. targeting closures to areas of highest habitat quality would benefit grizzly bear population recovery the most."
accommodating temporary emigration in spatial distance sampling models,bayesian hierarchical models; inhomogeneous point process; long-term monitoring; n-mixture model; over-dispersion; spatial distance sampling; spatially explicit models; superpopulation; temporary emigration,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MIZEL JD;SCHMIDT JH;LINDBERG MS,"1. model-based distance sampling is commonly used to understand spatial variation in the density of wildlife species. the standard approach assumes that individuals are distributed uniformly and models spatial variation in density using plot-level effects. thinned point process (tpp) models for surveys of unmarked populations (spatial distance sampling) better leverage the spatial information underlying individual encounters, and in the presence of within-plot variation in density, may explain a larger proportion of the spatial variation in density. however, existing spatial distance sampling approaches are conditioned on the assumption that all individuals are present and available for sampling. temporary emigration of individuals can therefore result in biased estimates of abundance. 2. we extended spatial distance sampling models to accommodate temporary emigration (tpp model). using simulations of a thinned inhomogeneous point process, we assessed the performance of the tpp model relative to the temporary emigration distance sampling (teds) model, which implies a uniform distribution of individuals. in addition, we compared inferences between tpp and teds models using data for two passerine species in alaska. 3. parameter estimates from the tpp model exhibited improved coverage probability and precision relative to the teds model including a 26% reduction in the coefficient of variation (cv) of the population size estimate. 4. in the applied example, the teds model indicated weak relationships between abundance and habitat covariates, whereas the tpp model indicated strong relationships for those same effects, suggesting that spatial distance sampling models can provide considerably stronger inference in the presence of within-plot variation in density. in addition, the cv of the population size estimates for the two passerine species were 32% and 4% smaller under the tpp model. 5. synthesis and applications. we expect our extension accommodating temporary emigration will be a critical specification for spatial distance sampling models, particularly for studies assessing changes in the distribution and abundance of highly mobile species including passerines."
using growth ring formation to study growth patterns of exploited sea urchin (loxechinus albus) populations,loxechinus albus fisheries; genital plates; size-truncation; mark and recapture; fisheries management,FISHERIES RESEARCH,BALBOA C;MOLINET C;BARAHONA N;DIAZ PA;SUBIABRE D;GEBAUER P,"the formation of growth rings on the genital plates of two exploited subpopulations of the sea urchin, loxechinus albus, using mark-recapture methods, was studied. regression models for ordinal data were used to analyze their variability, and its effect on growth patterns was evaluated by comparing parameters of the resulting growth models. the observed formation of growth rings in l. albus from january 2015 to february 2016 allowed to determine the sea urchins age with 90% accuracy in the picuta subpopulation, while in the westhoff sub population, age was determined correctly in only 77% of cases, with a significant percentage of sea urchins over 50 mm td that did not form new rings, suggesting precaution to estimate age using growth rings formation in sea urchins. the particular hydrodynamic characteristics of picuta and their effect on the sea urchin distribution, could explain the observed growth rate stability despite 40 years of intense fishing. westhoff, a system where only shallow subpopulations of sea urchin have been recorded, showed growth rate changes possibly associated with size-age truncation resulting from the fishing selective effect. implementation of monitoring in non-fishing areas where trends in the local population can be followed, would help to identify key processes in l. albus population dynamics and design suitable management strategies of this socio-economically important resource."
one-step estimation of networked population size: respondent-driven capture-recapture with anonymity,NA,PLOS ONE,KHAN B;LEE HW;FELLOWS I;DOMBROWSKI K,"size estimation is particularly important for populations whose members experience dispro-portionate health issues or pose elevated health risks to the ambient social structures in which they are embedded. efforts to derive size estimates are often frustrated when the population is hidden or hard-to-reach in ways that preclude conventional survey strategies, as is the case when social stigma is associated with group membership or when group members are involved in illegal activities. this paper extends prior research on the problem of network population size estimation, building on established survey/sampling methodologies commonly used with hard-to-reach groups. three novel one-step, network-based population size estimators are presented, for use in the context of uniform random sampling, respondent-driven sampling, and when networks exhibit significant clustering effects. we give provably sufficient conditions for the consistency of these estimators in large configuration networks. simulation experiments across a wide range of synthetic network topologies validate the performance of the estimators, which also perform well on a real-world location-based social networking data set with significant clustering. finally, the proposed schemes are extended to allow them to be used in settings where participant anonymity is required. systematic experiments show favorable tradeoffs between anonymity guarantees and estimator performance. taken together, we demonstrate that reasonable population size estimates are derived from anonymous respondent driven samples of 250-750 individuals, within ambient populations of 5,000-40,000. the method thus represents a novel and cost-effective means for health planners and those agencies concerned with health and disease surveillance to estimate the size of hidden populations. we discuss limitations and future work in the concluding section."
increased male bias in eider ducks can be explained by sex-specific survival of prime-age breeders,NA,PLOS ONE,RAMULA S;OST M;LINDEN A;KARELL P;KILPI M,"in contrast to theoretical predictions of even adult sex ratios, males are dominating in many bird populations. such bias among adults may be critical to population growth and viability. nevertheless, demographic mechanisms for biased adult sex ratios are still poorly understood. here, we examined potential demographic mechanisms for the recent dramatic shift from a slight female bias among adult eider ducks (somateria mollissima) to a male bias (about 65% males) in the baltic sea, where the species is currently declining. we analysed a nine-year dataset on offspring sex ratio at hatching based on molecularly sexed ducklings of individually known mothers. moreover, using demographic data from long-term individual-based capture-recapture records, we investigated how sex-specific survival at different ages after fledgling can modify the adult sex ratio. more specifically, we constructed a stochastic two-sex matrix population model and simulated scenarios of different survival probabilities for males and females. we found that sex ratio at hatching was slightly female-biased (52.8%) and therefore unlikely to explain the observed male bias among adult birds. our stochastic simulations with higher survival for males than for females revealed that despite a slight female bias at hatching, study populations shifted to a male-biased adult sex ratio (> 60% males) in a few decades. this shift was driven by prime reproductive-age individuals(>5-year-old), with sex-specific survival of younger age classes playing a minor role. hence, different age classes contributed disproportion ally to population dynamics. we argue that an alternative explanation for the observed male dominance among adults sex-biased dispersal can be considered redundant and is unlikely, given the ecology of the species. the present study highlights the importance of considering population structure and age-specific vital rates when assessing population dynamics and management targets."
health care providers' compliance with the notifiable diseases surveillance system in south africa,NA,PLOS ONE,BENSON FG;LEVIN J;RISPEL LC,"background the optimal performance of a notifiable disease surveillance system (ndss) is dependent on health care provider (hcp) compliance with communicable disease notification. hcp compliance ensures appropriate investigation and control measures by relevant health care authorities. this study examines the compliance of hcps with the ndss in south africa and factors associated with their compliance. methods a cross-sectional survey was carried out in three randomly selected provinces. we stratified by type of facility, and recruited clusters of hcps on survey day to participate. all consenting hcps in the randomly selected health care facilities on the day of the survey, completed a questionnaire that elicited information on socio-demographic characteristics and notification practices. the data were analysed using stata (r) 14, using the identifiers for stratum and cluster as well as the calculated sampling weights. results the study found that 58% of 919 hcps diagnosed a notifiable disease in the year preceding the survey. the majority of these professionals (92%) indicated that they had reported the disease, but only 51% of those notified the disease/s correctly to the department of health. paediatricians were less likely to notify correctly (or 0.01, 95% ci 0.00-0.12, p = 0.001). the factors that influenced notification were hcps perceptions of workload (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.70-0.99, p = 0.043) and that notification data are not useful (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.71-0.99, p = 0.040). the study found no association between correct notification and hcps willingness to notify, experience or training on the ndss, understanding of the purpose of the ndss, knowledge of what to notify, or perception of feedback given. conclusions the compliance of hcps in south africa with the ndss is suboptimal. in light of the important role of hcps in the effective functioning of the ndss, information on ndss usefulness and guidelines on correct notification procedures are needed to increase their compliance."
do responsibly managed logging concessions adequately protect jaguars and other large and medium-sized mammals? two case studies from guatemala and peru,reduced-impact logging; multi-species occupancy model; spatial capture-recapture; madre de dios; peten; maya biosphere reserve; camera traps; forest management,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,TOBLER MW;ANLEU RG;CARRILLO PERCASTEGUI SE;SANTIZO GP;POLISAR J;HARTLEY AZ;GOLDSTEIN I,"large areas of tropical forest have been designated for timber production but logging practices vary widely. reduced-impact logging is considered best practice and third-party certification aims to ensure that strict standards are met. this includes minimizing the number of roads constructed, avoiding sensitive areas and strictly regulating hunting. large scale camera trap grids were utilized in guatemala and peru to evaluate the impact of reduced-impact logging in certified concessions upon the large and medium-sized mammal fauna with special emphasis on jaguars (panthera once). spatial capture-recapture models showed that jaguar density in peru (4.54 +/- 0.83 ind. 100 km(-2)) was significantly higher than in guatemala (1.52 +/- 0.34 ind. 100 km(-2)) but in both regions, densities were comparable to protected areas. camera traps detected 22 species of large and medium sized mammals in guatemala and 27 in peru and a multi-species occupancy model revealed that logging had no negative impact on any of the species studied and actually had an initial positive impact on several herbivore species. we found no avoidance of logging roads; in fact, many species, especially carnivores, frequently used logging roads as movement corridors. our results indicate that well-managed logging concessions can maintain important populations of large and medium-sized mammals including large herbivores and large carnivores as long as hunting is controlled and timber volumes extracted are low. responsible forest management would therefore be an ideal activity in the buffer zones and multiple use zones of protected areas creating much less impact and conflict than alternatives such as agriculture or cattle ranching while still providing economic opportunities. logging concessions can also play an important role in maintaining landscape connectivity between protected areas."
estimating individual fitness in the wild using capture-recapture data,delifing; growth rate; imperfect detection; lifetime reproductive success; mark-recapture; state-space models,POPULATION ECOLOGY,GIMENEZ O;GAILLARD JM,"the concept of darwinian fitness is central in evolutionary ecology, and its estimation has motivated the development of several approaches. however, measuring individual fitness remains challenging in empirical case studies in the wild. measuring fitness requires a continuous monitoring of individuals from birth to death, which is very difficult to get in part because individuals may or may not be controlled at each reproductive event and recovered at death. imperfect detection hampers keeping track of mortality and reproductive events over the whole lifetime of individuals. we propose a new statistical approach to estimate individual fitness while accounting for imperfect detection. based on hidden process modelling of longitudinal data on marked animals, we show that standard metrics to quantify fitness, namely lifetime reproductive success, individual growth rate and lifetime individual contribution to population growth, can be extended to cope with imperfect detection inherent to most monitoring programs in the wild. we illustrate our approach using data collected on individual roe deer in an intensively monitored population."
identifying important conservation areas for the clouded leopard neofelis nebulosa in a mountainous landscape: inference from spatial modeling techniques,conservation planning; density; occupancy models; site use; spatial autocorrelation,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,PENJOR U;MACDONALD DW;WANGCHUK S;TANDIN T;TAN CKW,"the survival of large carnivores is increasingly precarious due to extensive human development that causes the habitat loss and fragmentation. habitat selection is influenced by anthropogenic as well as environmental factors, and understanding these relationships is important for conservation management. we assessed the environmental and anthropogenic variables that influence site use of clouded leopard neofelis nebulosa in bhutan, estimated their population density, and used the results to predict the species' site use across bhutan. we used a large camera-trap dataset from the national tiger survey to estimate for clouded leopards, for the first time in bhutan, (1) population density using spatially explicit capture-recapture models and (2) site-use probability using occupancy models accounting for spatial autocorrelation. population density was estimated at d = 0.40 (0.10 sd) and d maximum-likelihood=0.30 (0.12 se) per 100km(2). clouded leopard site use was positively associated with forest cover and distance to river while negatively associated with elevation. mean site-use probability (from the bayesian spatial model) was =0.448 (0.076 sd). when spatial autocorrelation was ignored, the probability of site use was overestimated, =0.826 (0.066 sd). predictive mapping allowed us to identify important conservation areas and priority habitats to sustain the future of these elusive, ambassador felids and associated guilds. multiple sites in the south, many of them outside of protected areas, were identified as habitats suitable for this species, adding evidence to conservation planning for clouded leopards in continental south asia."
a mark-recapture-based approach for estimating angler harvest,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HANSEN JM;VAN KIRK RW,"fishing effort in traditional creel surveys is derived from instantaneous angler counts, which in some fisheries can carry a high cost in personnel time, resources, and safety. to estimate angler effort more efficiently and at lower cost, we used mark-recapture methods to estimate weekly angler populations in pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead o. mykiss fisheries on the salmon river, idaho. weekly harvest estimates were the product of weekly angler population, mean number of days fished per angler per week, and mean harvest per angler per day. we compared traditional and mark-recapture estimates of weekly harvest using paired analysis on a sample of 48weeks. we found no significant difference in harvest estimates between traditional and mark-recapture methods, and the mark-recapture estimates in our fisheries could be made at a savings of up to 50% in vehicle mileage associated with conducting angler counts. however, the width of 95% cis around harvest estimates was significantly higher for the mark-recapture method, due to higher upper confidence limits resulting from right-skewness of the sampling distribution of the mark-recapture-based estimator. precision could be improved by replacing time spent on counts in the traditional method with more time spent capturing anglers at access sites, still providing savings in vehicle mileage."
evaluating the effect of dam removals on yellow-phase american eel abundance in a northeastern us watershed,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,TURNER SM;CHASE BC;BEDNARSKI MS,"the negative effects of dams and the benefits of dam removal for anadromous fish populations have been well documented. effects of dams on catadromous anguillidae species may be less drastic, although documentation of the response of catadromous fishes to dam removal is limited. we developed a mark-recapture study design to estimate the abundance of catadromous american eel anguilla rostrata within a small coastal watershed and compare abundance estimates before and after barrier removal. in the mill river, taunton, massachusetts, four dams have or will be modified for passage or removed. mark-recapture sampling and modeling methods were developed and applied in lake sabbatia, the source of the mill river, over 4years from the initiation of restoration. rectangular eel traps had higher cpue than double-funnel traps used in previous studies, and a tag retention study found high retention rates by using established methods (94% overall). abundances of yellow-phase american eels have increased with improved passage and recruitment to sampling gear during the study period. dam removal could have substantial benefits to the coastwide stock of american eels, and methods to evaluate changes in abundances are important for resource management as well as restoration ecology and project selection."
under-ice population density estimation of alaska blackfish,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,FRALEY KM;HAYNES TB;LOPEZ JA,"the alaska blackfish dallia pectoralis is an understudied but ecologically important mudminnow occurring in lentic ecosystems of subarctic and arctic alaska. we sampled a population of alaska blackfish during the winter months in an upland pond near fairbanks, alaska, and we used a simple mark-recapture estimator to provide the first population estimate for this species. we found that alaska blackfish density in the pond was approximately 0.27individuals/m(2), equating to an estimated biomass of 15g/m(2) of pond surface area, which is similar to density estimates reported for other mudminnow species. we tested capture methods and found that under-ice minnow trapping was a poor method during early winter (september-december) but was highly effective near methane sumps and areas of high muskrat ondatra zibethicus activity in late winter (march-april). qualitatively, nearshore minnow trapping, seining, and kicknetting during the ice-free season were less effective than under-ice trapping. cursorily, pelvic fin clips were more effective for batch marking of alaska blackfish than two types of subcutaneous tags, given the high numbers of individuals we captured and the species' relatively small body size and dark skin, which hindered tag visualization. we demonstrated that alaska blackfish can occur at high densities in their typical habitat, underscoring their importance as forage fish in alaskan freshwater ecosystems that support subsistence and sport fisheries for piscivorous fishes. extending this approach across the geographic range of alaska blackfish will improve understanding of the ecological role of this species in the varying aquatic ecosystems where it occurs."
counting bears in the iranian caucasus: remarkable mismatch between scientifically-sound population estimates and perceptions,bear abundance; spatial capture-recapture; noninvasive genetic sampling; perceptions; guesstimates; evidence-based conservation,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,MOQANAKI EM;JIMENEZ J;BENSCH S;LOPEZ BAO JV,"lack of reliable information on the status of species often leads managers to exclusively rely on experiential knowledge, opinions or perceptions, usually derived from personnel associated with natural resource management agencies. yet, the accuracy of these sources of information remains largely untested. we approached this challenge, which is particularly common for wildlife monitoring programs in developing countries, using a population of asian brown bears (ursus arctos) in the iranian caucasus as case study. we conducted a non-invasive, genetic, spatial capture-recapture (scr) study to estimate bear density across a core protected area, arasbaran biosphere reserve, and compared our estimate of bear abundance with rangers' perceptions as collated through interviews. the perceived abundance of bears by local rangers was between 3 and 5 times higher than our scr estimate of 40 bears (2.5-97.5% bayesian credible intervals = 27-70; density: 4.88 bears/100 km(2)). our results suggest that basing management of the local bear population on perceptions of population status may result in overestimating the likelihood of population persistence. our findings offer a scientific baseline for an evidence -based conservation policy for brown bears in iran, and the broader caucasus ecoregion. the majority of threatened terrestrial megafauna occur in developing countries, where collecting and analyzing demographic data remain challenging. delayed conservation responses due to the lack of, or erroneous knowledge of population status of such imperiled species may have serious consequences."
inferring species interactions through joint mark-recapture analysis,bayesian; competition; density dependence; gila cypha; interspecific; intraspecific; mark-recapture; oncorhynchus mykiss; predation,ECOLOGY,YACKULIC CB;KORMAN J;YARD MD;DZUL M,"introduced species are frequently implicated in declines of native species. in many cases, however, evidence linking introduced species to native declines is weak. failure to make strong inferences regarding the role of introduced species can hamper attempts to predict population viability and delay effective management responses. for many species, mark-recapture analysis is the more rigorous form of demographic analysis. however, to our knowledge, there are no mark-recapture models that allow for joint modeling of interacting species. here, we introduce a two-species mark-recapture population model in which the vital rates (and capture probabilities) of one species are allowed to vary in response to the abundance of the other species. we use a simulation study to explore bias and choose an approach to model selection. we then use the model to investigate species interactions between endangered humpback chub (gila cypha) and introduced rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in the colorado river between 2009 and 2016. in particular, we test hypotheses about how two environmental factors (turbidity and temperature), intraspecific density dependence, and rainbow trout abundance are related to survival, growth, and capture of juvenile humpback chub. we also project the long-term effects of different rainbow trout abundances on adult humpback chub abundances. our simulation study suggests this approach has minimal bias under potentially challenging circumstances (i.e., low capture probabilities) that characterized our application and that model selection using indicator variables could reliably identify the true generating model even when process error was high. when the model was applied to rainbow trout and humpback chub, we identified negative relationships between rainbow trout abundance and the survival, growth, and capture probability of juvenile humpback chub. effects on interspecific interactions on survival and capture probability were strongly supported, whereas support for the growth effect was weaker. environmental factors were also identified to be important and in many cases stronger than interspecific interactions, and there was still substantial unexplained variation in growth and survival rates. the general approach presented here for combining mark-recapture data for two species is applicable in many other systems and could be modified to model abundance of the invader via other modeling approaches."
the interacting effects of forestry and climate change on the demography of a group-living bird population,climate change; forestry; demography; elasticity analysis; multi-state mark-recapture,OECOLOGIA,LAYTON MATTHEWS K;OZGUL A;GRIESSER M,"anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats is a global driver of wildlife population declines. local population responses to such environmental perturbations are generally well understood, but in socially structured populations, interactions between environmental and social factors may influence population responses. thus, understanding how habitat degradation affects the dynamics of these populations requires simultaneous consideration of social and environmental mechanisms underlying demographic responses. here we investigated the effect of habitat degradation through commercial forestry on spatiotemporal dynamics of a group-living bird, the siberian jay, perisoreus infaustus, in boreal forests of northern sweden. we assessed the interacting effects of forestry, climate and population density on stage-specific, seasonal life-history rates and population dynamics, using long-term, individual-based demographic data from 70 territories in natural and managed forests. stage-specific survival and reproductive rates, and consequently population growth, were lower in managed forests than in natural forests. population growth was most sensitive to breeder survival and was more sensitive to early dispersing juveniles than those delaying dispersal. forestry decreased population growth in managed forests by reducing reproductive success and breeder survival. increased snow depth improved winter survival, and warmer spring temperatures enhanced reproductive success, particularly in natural forests. population growth was stable in natural forests but it was declining in managed forests, and this difference accelerated under forecasted climate scenarios. thus, climatic change could exacerbate the rate of forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover in our study species, and in other species with similar life-history characteristics and habitat requirements."
when carapace governs size: variation among age classes and individuals in a free-ranging ectotherm with delayed maturity,cohorts; indeterminate growth; longevity; tortoise; vbs,OECOLOGIA,ARSOVSKI D;TOMOVIC L;GOLUBOVIC A;NIKOLIC S;STERIJOVSKI B;AJTIC R;BALLOUARD JM;BONNET X,"juvenile growth strongly impacts life-history traits during adulthood. yet, in juveniles with delayed maturity, elusiveness has hindered age-specific studies of growth, precluding any detailed research on its consequences later in life. different complex growth patterns have been extracted from captive animals, suggesting species-specific trajectories occur in free-ranging animals. how pronounced are growth and body size variation (vbs) throughout a long-lived ectotherm's life? is vbs constant among age classes prior to maturity, or do compensatory and/or cumulative effects driven by long-lived-animal-specific strategies create distinct vbs cohorts, to ensure survival? to tackle the issue, we modelled growth data from continuous and dense annual capture-mark-recapture sampling (5096 body measurements of 1134 free-ranging individuals) of both immature and mature, long-lived hermann's tortoises. we analysed population, cohort, and individual-based growth and vbs. growth ring inferred ages were cross validated with annual recaptures in 289 juveniles. analyses unravelled an s-shaped growth curve and identified three age cohorts across which vbs increases in a step-wise manner. neonate-specific constraints and compensatory effects seem to control vbs until 4 years of age, possibly promoting survival with size. subsequently, a hardened carapace takes over and cumulative effects fuelled by faster growth progressively increase vbs. whereas ungulates are in a hurry to attain adult size before growth ceases (minimizing vbs), indeterminately growing tortoises can shape individual asymptotic sizes even after growth decelerates. tortoise size is clearly shaped by age-specific ecological constraints; interestingly, it is likely the carapace that conducts the strategy, rather than maturity per se."

extraction of dna from captive-sourced feces and molted feathers provides a novel method for conservation management of new zealand kiwi (apteryx spp.),apteryx spp; conservation; feces; low-template dna; microsatellites; noninvasive,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,RAMON LACA A;WHITE DJ;WEIR JT;ROBERTSON HA,"although some taxa are increasing in number due to active management and predator control, the overall number of kiwi (apteryx spp.) is declining. kiwi are cryptic and rare, meaning current monitoring tools, such as call counts, radio telemetry, and surveys using detection dogs are labor-intensive, yield small datasets, and require substantial resources or provide inaccurate estimates of population sizes. a noninvasive genetic approach could help the conservation effort. we optimized a panel of 23 genetic markers (22 autosomal microsatellite loci and an allosomal marker) to discriminate between all species of kiwi and major lineages within species, while simultaneously determining sex. markers successfully amplified from both fecal and shed feather dna samples collected in captivity. we found that dna extraction was more efficient from shed feathers, but dna quality was greater with feces, although this was sampling dependent. our microsatellite panel was able to distinguish between contemporary kiwi populations and lineages and provided pi values in the range of 4.3x10(-5) to 2.0x10(-19), which in some cases were sufficient for individualization and mark-recapture studies. as such, we have tested a wide-reaching, noninvasive molecular approach that will improve conservation management by providing better parameter estimates associated with population ecology and demographics such as abundance, growth rates, and genetic diversity."
spatial patterns of the frog oophaga pumilio in a plantation system are consistent with conspecific attraction,colonization; habitat selection; nearest-neighbor analysis; neotropics; spatial ecology,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,FOLT B;DONNELLY MA;GUYER C,"the conspecific attraction hypothesis predicts that individuals are attracted to conspecifics because conspecifics may be cues to quality habitat and/or colonists may benefit from living in aggregations. poison frogs (dendrobatidae) are aposematic, territorial, and visually orientedthree characteristics which make dendrobatids an appropriate model to test for conspecific attraction. in this study, we tested this hypothesis using an extensive mark-recapture dataset of the strawberry poison frog (oophaga pumilio) from la selva biological station, costa rica. data were collected from replicate populations in a relatively homogenous theobroma cacao plantation, which provided a unique opportunity to test how conspecifics influence the spatial ecology of migrants in a controlled habitat with homogenous structure. we predicted that (1) individuals entering a population would aggregate with resident adults, (2) migrants would share sites with residents at a greater frequency than expected by chance, and (3) migrant home ranges would have shorter nearest-neighbor distances (nnd) to residents than expected by chance. the results were consistent with these three predictions: relative to random simulations, we observed significant aggregation, home-range overlap, and nnd distribution functions in four, five, and six, respectively, of the six migrant-resident groups analyzed. conspecific attraction may benefit migrant o.pumilio by providing cues to suitable home sites and/or increasing the potential for social interactions with conspecifics; if true, these benefits should outweigh the negative effects of other factors associated with aggregation. the observed aggregation between migrant and resident o.pumilio is consistent with conspecific attraction in dendrobatid frogs, and our study provides rare support from a field setting that conspecific attraction may be a relevant mechanism for models of anuran spatial ecology."
genotyping validates photo-identification by the head scale pattern in a large population of the european adder (vipera berus),capture-recapture; double-marking; genotyping; individual recognition; natural markings,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BAUWENS D;CLAUS K;MERGEAY J,"capture-mark-recapture procedures are a basic tool in population studies and require that individual animals are correctly identified throughout their lifetime. a method that has become more and more popular uses photographic records of natural markings, such as pigmentation pattern and scalation configuration. as with any other marking tool, the validity of the photographic identification technique should be evaluated thoroughly. here, we report on a large-scale double-marking study in which european adders (vipera berus) were identified by both microsatellite genetic markers and by the pattern of head scalation. samples that were successfully genotyped for all nine loci yielded 624 unique genotypes, which matched on a one-to-one basis with the individual assignments based on the head scalation pattern. thus, adders considered as different individuals by their genotypes were also identified as different individuals by their head scalation pattern, and vice versa. overall, variation in the numbers, shape, and arrangement of the head scales enabled us to distinguish among 3200+ photographed individual snakes. adders that were repeatedly sequenced genetically over intervals of 2-3years showed no indication whatsoever for a change in the head scale pattern. photographic records of 900+ adders that were recaptured over periods of up to 12years showed a very detailed and precise match of the head scale characteristics. these natural marks are thus robust over time and do not change during an individual's lifetime. with very low frequency (0.3%), we detected small changes in scalation that were readily discernible and could be attributed to physical injury or infection. our study provides a conclusive validation for the use of photo-identification by head scale patterns in the european adder."
estimating animal density without individual recognition using information derivable exclusively from camera traps,animal movement; camera trap; density estimation; distance sampling; individual recognition; population monitoring; random encounter model; rest model; trapping rate; ungulates,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,NAKASHIMA Y;FUKASAWA K;SAMEJIMA H,"1. efficient and reliable methods for estimating animal density are essential to wildlife conservation and management. camera trapping is an increasingly popular tool in this area of wildlife research, with further potential arising from technological improvements, such as video-recording functions that allow for behavioural observation of animals. this information may be useful in the estimation of animal density, even without individual recognition. although several models applicable to species lacking individual markings (i.e. unmarked populations) have been developed, a methodology incorporating behavioural information from videos has not yet been established. 2. we developed a likelihood-based model: the random encounter and staying time (rest) model. it is an extension of the random encounter model by rowcliffe et al. (j appl ecol 45: 1228, 2008). the rest model describes the relationship among staying time, trapping rate, and density, which is estimable using a frequentist or bayesian approach. we tested the reliability and feasibility of the rest model using monte carlo simulations. we also applied the approach in the african rainforest and compared the results with those of a line-transect survey. 3. the simulations showed that the rest model provided unbiased estimates of animal density. even when animal movement speeds varied among individuals, and when animals travelled in pairs, the model provided unbiased density estimates. however, the rest model was vulnerable to unsynchronized activity patterns among individuals. moreover, it is necessary to use a camera model with a fast and reliable infrared sensor and to set the camera trap's parameters appropriately (i.e. video length, delay period). the field survey showed that the staying time of two ungulate species in the african rainforest exhibited good fit with a temporal parametric distribution, and the rest model provided density estimates consistent with those of a line-transect survey. 4. synthesis and applications. the random encounter and staying time model provides better efficiency and higher feasibility than the random encounter model in estimating animal density without individual recognition. careful application of the random encounter and staying time model provides the potential to estimate density of many ground-dwelling vertebrates lacking individually recognizable markings, and thus should be an effective method for population monitoring."
size-selectivity for british columbia sablefish (anoplopoma fimbria) estimated from a long-term tagging study,fishery size-selectivity; tagging-data; sablefish; anoplopoma fimbria; dome-shaped selectivity; stock assessment,FISHERIES RESEARCH,JONES MK;COX S,"the underlying size-distribution of commercial fish stocks is usually unknown, so fishery size-selectivity must be estimated as a latent process embedded within age-structured stock assessments. however, dome-shaped fishery size-selectivity, in particular, is often inestimable because decreasing selectivity is confounded with mortality at older ages. in this paper, we test for dome-shaped selectivity in british columbia's sablefish fishery using a long-term tagging data set. we incorporate alternative fishery size-selectivity assumptions within a mark-recapture framework based on an asymptotic logistic model and dome-shaped models using gamma and normal probability density functions. we also fit each model using both time-invariant and time-varying parameterizations. our results strongly suggest dome-shaped size-selectivity for tagged-sablefish in longline trap, longline hook, and bottom trawl fisheries. time-varying models were generally favored over time-invariant models, although alternative time-varying models often produced similar statistical fits. dome-shaped selectivity in longline fisheries could be a function of fishery targeting, fish movement, or by lower reporting rates for large size classes."
forest bat population dynamics over 14 years at a climate refuge: effects of timber harvesting and weather extremes,NA,PLOS ONE,LAW BS;CHIDEL M;LAW PR,"long-term data are needed to explore the interaction of weather extremes with habitat alteration; in particular, can 'refugia' buffer population dynamics against climate change and are they robust to disturbances such as timber harvesting. because forest bats are good indicators of ecosystem health, we used 14 years (1999-2012) of mark-recapture data from a suite of small tree-hollow roosting bats to estimate survival, abundance and body condition in harvested and unharvested forest and over extreme el nino and la nina weather events in southeastern australia. trapping was replicated within an experimental forest, located in a climate refuge, with different timber harvesting treatments. we trapped foraging bats and banded 3043 with a 32% retrap rate. mark-recapture analyses allowed for dependence of survival on time, species, sex, logging treatment and for transients. a large portion of the population remained resident, with a maximum time to recapture of nine years. the effect of logging history (unlogged vs 16-30 years post-logging regrowth) on apparent survival was minor and species specific, with no detectable effect for two species, a positive effect for one and negative for the other. there was no effect of logging history on abundance or body condition for any of these species. apparent survival of residents was not strongly influenced by weather variation (except for the smallest species), unlike previous studies outside of refugia. despite annual variation in abundance and body condition across the 14 years of the study, no relationship with extreme weather was evident. the location of our study area in a climate refuge potentially buffered bat population dynamics from extreme weather. these results support the value of climate refugia in mitigating climate change impacts, though the lack of an external control highlights the need for further studies on the functioning of climate refugia. relatively stable population dynamics were not compromised by timber harvesting, suggesting ecologically sustainable harvesting may be compatible with climate refugia."
how difficult is it to reintroduce a dragonfly? fifteen years monitoring leucorrhinia dubia at the receiving site,conservation translocation; dragonfly reintroduction; odonata; long-term monitoring,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,DOLNY A;SIGUTOVA H;OZANA S;CHOLEVA L,"conservation translocations (including reintroductions) are potentially powerful tools for wildlife conservation, and their use has increased worldwide. however, most studies have focused on vertebrates, with the long-term impact and ecological progress of translocations being neglected. moreover, such projects rarely target insects. the present study reports the long-term persistence of a population of leucorrhinia dubia (odonata: libellulidae) reintroduced to artificially created bog pools in the czech republic. eighty (pen)ultimate instar l. dubia larvae were translocated in 2001, and the dragonfly assemblage at the reintroduction site was monitored for 15 years following larvae release. in 2015-2017, the capture-mark-recapture method, the jolly-seber model, and exuviae collection were used to evaluate the demography of the translocated population. microsatellite analysis was performed to assess the genetic variability of source and reintroduced populations. over the monitored period, population size increased (80 larvae released vs. 108-115 exuviae and 75 adults at the end of the study) and l. dubia became a dominant species, whereas the composition and abundance of the local dragonfly assemblage were not substantially changed. these results indicate that reintroductions are effective measures for dragonfly conservation, as translocating a relatively small number of individuals led to the establishment of a self-sustaining population. using (pen)ultimate instar larvae was optimal for dragonfly translocation, but the availability of a high-quality habitat and the active collaboration with nature conservation authorities were vital for the successful outcome. genetic analysis suggested that the translocated population might serve as a source of genetic variation for the original population, if depleted."
tagging effects of passive integrated transponder and visual implant elastomer on the small-bodied white sands pupfish (cyprinodon tularosa),pupfish; tagging effects; passive integrated transponder tag; elastomeric tag,FISHERIES RESEARCH,PETERSON D;TRANTHAM RB;TRANTHAM TG;CALDWELL CA,"one of the greatest limiting factors of studies designed to obtain growth, movement, and survival in small-bodied fishes is the selection of a viable tag. the tag must be relatively small with respect to body size as to impart minimal sub-lethal effects on growth and mobility, as well as be retained throughout the life of the fish or duration of the study. thus, body size of the model species becomes a major limiting factor; yet few studies have obtained empirical evidence of the minimum fish size and related tagging effects. the probability of surviving a tagging event was quantified in white sands pupfish (cyprinodon tularosa) across a range of sizes (19-60 mm) to address the hypothesis that body size predicts tagging survival. we compared tagging related mortality, individual taggers, growth, and tag retention in white sands pupfish implanted with 8-mm passive integrated transponder (pit), visual implant elastomer (vie), and control (handled similarly, but no tag implantation) over a 75 d period. initial body weight was a good predictor of the probability of survival in pit- and vie-tagged fish. as weight increased by 1 g, the fish were 4.73 times more likely to survive pit-tag implantation compared to the control fish with an estimated suitable tagging size at 1.1 g (tl: 39.29 +/- 0.41 mm). likewise, vie-tagged animals were 2.27 dines more likely to survive a tagging event compared to the control group for every additional 1 g with an estimated size suitable for tagging of 0.9 g (tl: 36.9 +/- 0.36 mm) fish. growth rates of pit- and vie tagged white sands pupfish were similar to the control groups. this research validated two popular tagging methodologies in the white sands pupfish, thus providing a valuable tool for characterizing vital rates in other small-bodied fishes."
integrated population models facilitate ecological understanding and improved management decisions,band recovery; fecundity; harvest surveys; integrated population models; survival; waterfowl management,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,ARNOLD TW;CLARK RG;KOONS DN;SCHAUB M,"integrated population models (ipms) represent a formal statistical methodology for combining multiple data sets such as population counts, band recoveries, and fecundity estimates into a single unified analysis with dual objectives: better estimating population size, trajectory, and vital rates; and formally describing the ecological processes that generated these patterns. although ipms have been used in population ecology and fisheries management, their use in wildlife management has been limited. data sets available for north american waterfowl are unprecedented in terms of time span (> 60 years) and geographic coverage, and are especially well-suited for development of ipms that could improve the understanding of population ecology and help guide future harvest and habitat management decisions. in this overview, we illustrate 3 potential benefits of ipms: integration of multiple data sources (i.e., population counts, mark-recapture data, and fecundity estimates), increased precision of parameter estimates, and ability to estimate missing demographic parameters by reanalyzing results from a historical study of canvasbacks (aythya valisineria). drawing from our own published and unpublished work, we demonstrate how ipms could be used to identify the critical vital rates that have had the greatest influence on population change in lesser scaup (aythya affinis), evaluate potential mechanisms of harvest compensation for american black ducks (anas rubripes), or prioritize the most appropriate places to conduct habitat management to benefit northern pintails (anas acuta). integrated population models provide a powerful platform for evaluating alternative hypotheses about population regulation and they have potential to advance the understanding of wildlife ecology and help managers make ecologically based decisions.

entrainment of juvenile and adult american shad at a pumped storage facility,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,MATHUR D;HEISEY PG;ROYER DD;WHITE EJ;SLOWIK AC;BLEISTINE RA;PRACHEIL BM;LONG KA;SULLIVAN TJ,"the american shad alosa sapidissima has been targeted for restoration to the upper susquehanna river, and entrainment losses at hydroelectric facilities on the river, including the muddy run pumped storage facility, are of concern for the potential growth of the american shad population. based on the integration of pumping volume, time of entrainment, and literature-reported diel emigration of juvenile american shad, the entrainment rate (n=145; 53 exposed to pumping) was estimated at 3.5%. the entrainment rate for adults (n=507) was estimated at 0.3-3.9%. using multistate mark-recapture models, the estimated entrainment probabilities () of radio-tagged juveniles were higher during periods of extended pumping (>1h; =0.093; 95% confidence interval [ci]=0.054-0.156) than at periods of no pumping or short-duration pumping (<1h; <0.0001; 95% ci=0.0-0.001); the high extended pumping occurred between 2300 and 0600hours. entrainment probabilities for adults were low (<0.02); the highest probability occurred for fish detected downstream of the intake during the peak portion of the run (=0.015; 95% ci=0.004-0.047). entrainment probability for most adult fish did not differ from zero. the low values of for both life stages were attributed to (1) the deep location of the intake (intake ceiling >11.7m below the water surface), (2) the surface orientation of american shad (upper 3.1m), (3) the low overlap between high-volume pumping and peak emigration/migration times, (4) the pumping volume relative to prevailing river flows, and (5) the prolonged, robust swimming speed of american shad, particularly that of adults (>2.2m/s), which exceeded the intake velocity (0.2-0.9m/s). entrainment of juveniles increased with co-occurrence of low incoming river flows, high pumping volume, and peak emigration times. quantification of migratory species' entrainment at pumped storage facilities requires integration of diel migration/emigration times with the frequency, timing, and duration of pumping volume."
a novel approach to estimating density of american badgers (taxidea taxus) using automatic cameras at water sources in the chihuahuan desert,american badger; anthropogenic water source; camera trap; chihuahuan desert; density; dorsal head stripe; secr; spatially explicit capture-recapture; taxidea taxus,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,GOULD MJ;HARRISON RL,"american badgers (taxidea taxus) are large members of the weasel family mustelidae. badgers are important predators and creators of burrows in ecosystems in which they occur, but they are not well studied. their range occurs over most of north america; however, most studies of badgers have occurred in california and the northern portions of their range, while few have occurred in southern habitats. badger density has been estimated in utah, idaho, wyoming, and british columbia with no estimates from desert habitats. to measure badger density in a desert habitat, we placed automatic cameras at anthropogenic water sources (drinkers) in the chihuahuan desert, identified individual badgers by their dorsal head stripes, and estimated density using spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis. we modeled the detection process for individuals as a function of time, survey region, a learned and trap-specific behavioral response, and a finite mixture model. we then hypothesized that soil composition, soil depth, and land cover influence variation in badger density. from 1,282 camera-nights, we recorded 301 badger visits (23.5 visits per 100 camera-nights) and identified 30 individuals 170 times. the top model included a trap-specific behavioral effect for lambda 0, a finite mixture model for the sigma parameter, which controls the spatial scale over which the expected number of detections declines, and indicated that soil depth was an important covariate explaining variation in badger density. estimated badger density was 0.10 badgers/km(2) (95% ci = 0.03-0.31), which is considerably less than the reported density estimates for nonendangered nondesert populations. our method helps provide researchers with an ability to estimate density for american badgers in arid ecosystems. with modification, our method may be used across the geographic range of badgers, facilitating better understanding of an understudied species."
fitness correlates of age at primiparity in a hunted moose population,age of maturity; cost of reproduction; individual heterogeneity; life history; ungulates,OECOLOGIA,MARKUSSEN SS;LOISON A;HERFINDAL I;SOLBERG EJ;HAANES H;ROED KH;HEIM M;SAETHER BE,"trade-offs between fitness-related traits are predicted from the principle of resource allocation, where increased fecundity or parental investment leads to reduced future reproduction or survival. however, fitness traits can also be positively correlated due to individual differences (e.g. body mass). age at primiparity could potentially explain variation in individual fitness either because early primiparity is costly, or it may lead to higher lifetime reproductive success. based on long-term monitoring and genetic parentage assignment of an island population of moose, we quantified reproductive performance and survival, and examined whether early maturing females have higher total calf production than late maturing females. we explored if harvesting of calves affected the subsequent reproductive success of their mothers, i.e. also due to a post-weaning cost of reproduction, and whether there are any intergenerational effects of female reproductive success. there was a positive relationship between current and future reproduction. the probability to reproduce was lower for females that were unsuccessful the year before, indicating a strong quality effect on productivity. females that started to reproduce as 2-year olds had a slightly higher total calf production compared to those starting at age three or four. high-performing mothers were also correlated with daughters that performed well in terms of reproductive success. our results suggest that the observed individual heterogeneity in fitness could be associated with differences in age at primiparity. this heterogeneity was not affected by reproductive costs associated with tending for a calf post-weaning."
completeness and reliability of mortality data in viet nam: implications for the national routine health management information system,NA,PLOS ONE,HONG TT;HOA NP;WALKER SM;HILL PS;RAO C,"background mortality statistics form a crucial component of national health management information systems (hmis). however, there are limitations in the availability and quality of mortality data at national level in viet nam. this study assessed the completeness of recorded deaths and the reliability of recorded causes of death (cod) in the a6 death registers in the national routine hmis in viet nam. methodology and findings 1477 identified deaths in 2014 were reviewed in two provinces. a capture-recapture method was applied to assess the completeness of the a6 death registers. 1365 household verbal autopsy (va) interviews were successfully conducted, and these were reviewed by physicians who assigned multiple and underlying cause of death (ucod). these ucods from va were then compared with the cods recorded in the a6 death registers, using kappa scores to assess the reliability of the a6 death register diagnoses. the overall completeness of the a6 death registers in the two provinces was 89.3% (95% ci: 87.8-90.8). no cod recorded in the a6 death registers demonstrated good reliability. there is very low reliability in recording of cardiovascular deaths (kappa for stroke = 0.47 and kappa for ischaemic heart diseases = 0.42) and diabetes (kappa = 0.33). the reporting of deaths due to road traffic accidents, hiv and some cancers are at a moderate level of reliability with kappa scores ranging between 0.57-0.69 (p< 0.01). va methods identify more specific cod than the a6 death registers, and also allow identification of multiple cods. conclusions the study results suggest that data completeness in hmis a6 death registers in the study sample of communes was relatively high (nearly 90%), but triangulation with death records from other sources would improve the completeness of this system. further, there is an urgent need to enhance the reliability of cod recorded in the a6 death registers, for which va methods could be effective. focussed consultation among stakeholders is needed to develop a suitable mechanism and process for integrating va methods into the national routine hmis a6 death registers in viet nam."
estimating population extinction thresholds with categorical classification trees for louisiana black bears,NA,PLOS ONE,LAUFENBERG JS;CLARK JD;CHANDLER RB,"monitoring vulnerable species is critical for their conservation. thresholds or tipping points are commonly used to indicate when populations become vulnerable to extinction and to trigger changes in conservation actions. however, quantitative methods to determine such thresholds have not been well explored. the louisiana black bear (ursus americanus luteolus) was removed from the list of threatened and endangered species under the u.s. endangered species act in 2016 and our objectives were to determine the most appropriate parameters and thresholds for monitoring and management action. capture mark recapture (cmr) data from 2006 to 2012 were used to estimate population parameters and variances. we used stochastic population simulations and conditional classification trees to identify demographic rates for monitoring that would be most indicative of heighted extinction risk. we then identified thresholds that would be reliable predictors of population viability. conditional classification trees indicated that annual apparent survival rates for adult females averaged over 5 years ((phi)over-bar(5)) was the best predictor of population persistence. specifically, population persistence was estimated to be >= 95% over 100 years when ((phi)over-bar(5) >= 0.90, suggesting that this statistic can be used as threshold to trigger management intervention. our evaluation produced monitoring protocols that reliably predicted population persistence and was cost-effective. we conclude that population projections and conditional classification trees can be valuable tools for identifying extinction thresholds used in monitoring programs."

when roads appear jaguars decline: increased access to an amazonian wilderness area reduces potential for jaguar conservation,NA,PLOS ONE,ESPINOSA S;CELIS G;BRANCH LC,"roads are a main threat to biodiversity conservation in the amazon, in part, because roads increase access for hunters. we examine how increased landscape access by hunters may lead to cascading effects that influence the prey community and abundance of the jaguar (panthera onca), the top amazonian terrestrial predator. understanding such ecological effects originating from anthropogenic actions is essential for conservation and management of wildlife populations in areas undergoing infrastructure development. our study was conducted in yasunf biosphere reserve, the protected area with highest potential for jaguar conservation in ecuador, and an area both threatened by road development and inhabited by indigenous groups dependent upon bushmeat. we surveyed prey and jaguar abundance with camera traps in four sites that differed in accessibility to hunters and used site occupancy and spatially explicit capture-recapture analyses to evaluate prey occurrence and estimate jaguar density, respectively. higher landscape accessibility to hunters was linked with lower occurrence and biomass of game, particularly white-lipped peccary (tayassu pecan) and collared peccary (pecari tajacu), the primary game for hunters and prey for jaguars. jaguar density was up to 18 times higher in the most remote site compared to the most accessible site. our results provide a strong case for the need to: 1) consider conservation of large carnivores and other wildlife in policies about road construction in protected areas, 2) coordinate conservation initiatives with local governments so that development activities do not conflict with conservation objectives, and 3) promote development of community-based strategies for wildlife management that account for the needs of large carnivores."

wildlife disease ecology from the individual to the population: insights from a long-term study of a naturally infected european badger population,disease dynamics; disease ecology; long-term study; mycobacterium bovis; pathogen transmission; superspreader; wildlife epidemiology,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,MCDONALD JL;ROBERTSON A;SILK MJ,"1. long-term individual-based datasets on host-pathogen systems are a rare and valuable resource for understanding the infectious disease dynamics in wildlife. a study of european badgers (meles meles) naturally infected with bovine tuberculosis (btb) at woodchester park in gloucestershire (uk) has produced a unique dataset, facilitating investigation of a diverse range of epidemiological and ecological questions with implications for disease management. 2. since the 1970s, this badger population has been monitored with a systematic mark-recapture regime yielding a dataset of >15,000 captures of >3,000 individuals, providing detailed individual life-history, morphometric, genetic, reproductive and disease data. 3. the annual prevalence of btb in the woodchester park badger population exhibits no straightforward relationship with population density, and both the incidence and prevalence of mycobacterium bovis show marked variation in space. the study has revealed phenotypic traits that are critical for understanding the social structure of badger populations along with mechanisms vital for understanding disease spread at different spatial resolutions. 4. woodchester-based studies have provided key insights into how host ecology can influence infection at different spatial and temporal scales. specifically, it has revealed heterogeneity in epidemiological parameters; intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting population dynamics; provided insights into senescence and individual life histories; and revealed consistent individual variation in foraging patterns, refuge use and social interactions. 5. an improved understanding of ecological and epidemiological processes is imperative for effective disease management. woodchester park research has provided information of direct relevance to btb management, and a better appreciation of the role of individual heterogeneity in disease transmission can contribute further in this regard. 6. the woodchester park study system now offers a rare opportunity to seek a dynamic understanding of how individual-, group- and population-level processes interact. the wealth of existing data makes it possible to take a more integrative approach to examining how the consequences of individual heterogeneity scale to determine population-level pathogen dynamics and help advance our understanding of the ecological drivers of host-pathogen systems."
movement and survival of wild chinook salmon smolts from butte creek during their out-migration to the ocean: comparison of a dry year versus a wet year,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,CORDOLEANI F;NOTCH J;MCHURON AS;AMMANN AJ;MICHEL CJ,"california's central valley (ccv) chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha stocks have declined substantially since the mid-1800s, with most listed as threatened or endangered or heavily supplemented by hatcheries. as the largest population of ccv wild spring-run chinook salmon, butte creek fish are an important source for promoting life history diversity in the ccv chinook salmon community. however, little information exists on butte creek juvenile mortality during out-migration to the ocean, which is considered a critical phase in the overall population dynamics. we used the juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system to track the movement of individual fish, and we used a mark-recapture modeling framework to estimate survival of migrating wild chinook salmon smolts from lower butte creek to ocean entry at the golden gate bridge. survival and migration varied significantly among years; in 2015, which was a dry year, chinook salmon smolts migrated more slowly throughout their migratory corridor and exhibited lower survival than in a wetter year (2016); among locations, fish migrated faster and experienced higher survival in the lower sacramento river than in the sutter bypass and the sacramento-san joaquin river delta. our data suggest that higher flow at release and larger fish lengths both resulted in increased survival. our findings shed light on a critical phase of wild spring-run juvenile chinook salmon dynamics and could help to inform future restoration and management projects that would improve the survival and abundance of the ccv spring-run chinook salmon populations."
growth estimation of western population segment gulf sturgeon using length-at-age and mark-recapture data,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,ANDRES MJ;SLACK WT;PETERSON MS;KIMMEL KD;LEWIS BR;GRAMMER PO,"multimodel inference of length-at-age and tag-recapture data was used to estimate growth for western population segment (wps; populations natal to the pearl river, louisiana, and the pascagoula river, mississippi) gulf sturgeon acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi. four candidate growth models were fitted to the length-at-age data (n=174): a three-parameter von bertalanffy growth function (vbgf), a two-parameter vbgf, a power model, and a gompertz model. model support for each data set was estimated using akaike's information criterion. the gompertz model provided the best fit to our length-at-age data and had the lowest mean asymptotic maximum length (l). mean estimated growth parameters for wps gulf sturgeon were similar to those estimated for eastern population segment gulf sturgeon, but some of the mean parameter estimates fell outside of our 95% confidence intervals. three growth curves were also fitted to tag-recapture data (n=116): a reformulated two-parameter vbgf, the francis () grotag model, and a reparametrized gompertz model. the grotag model provided the best fit to our data; all three models had lower mean estimates for l compared with parameter estimates based on length at age but had similar mean growth coefficients. we also compared the observed growth of 47 individuals with their predicted growth based on parameter estimates of the gompertz length-at-age model and their age at tagging. we found that observed growth was generally less than what was predicted for juveniles and adults. for adults, we attribute this to the inaccuracies associated with age estimation for older individuals, which suggests that a tag-recapture approach might be the most appropriate method of modeling gulf sturgeon growth. our study (1) demonstrates the importance of fitting multiple models to estimate growth, (2) will enable more accurate growth comparisons for gulf sturgeon across their range, and (3) represents the most robust length-at-age and tag-recapture data set for wps gulf sturgeon."
the importance of including survival release costs when assessing viability in reptile translocations,conservation management; hermann's tortoise; mark-recapture models; population viability analysis; reintroduction; testudo hermanni,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,BERTOLERO A;PRETUS JL;ORO D,"translocations to restore populations of endangered species are an important conservation tool, but a reliable diagnosis is needed to assess their success. we used capture-recapture modeling to analyze the adult apparent survival of released and resident tortoises in two translocation projects in spain monitored for 14 and 29 years. we tested if long-term survival rates differ between released and resident individuals, if survival was lower during the phase of establishment (i.e. release cost), how long acclimation lasts and if increased density due to releases affects survival. we found lower survival of released tortoises during the phase of establishment (1 to 3 years) when residents were already present. after establishment, survival was very high and unaffected by density-dependence. body condition before release was similar between recaptured and dead/missing tortoises, and did not predict establishment survival. stochastic population viability analysis showed that success when releasing small numbers of individuals strongly depends upon adult long-term survival. release of small second batches of tortoises was not sensitive to a growing population, regardless of its release timing. our results highlight long-term survival as crucial in translocation projects of long-lived species, invalidating short-term (first year) survival assessment, when survival release cost does not match long-term survival. a release cost of different duration should be included in model estimation before modeling predictions. releasing tortoises (for welfare of captive individuals or for mitigating human negative impacts) in an already established population is not recommended under most circumstances. acclimation cost is followed by survival approaching wild counterparts. if this milestone is not achieved, the project needs to be carefully assessed to adopt other management options or should be stopped altogether."
proximate causes of altitudinal differences in body size in an agamid lizard,body size; elevational variation; growth rate; phrynocephalus vlangalii; qinghai-tibetan plateau,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,LU HL;XU CX;JIN YT;HERO JM;DU WG,"body size is directly linked to key life history traits such as growth, fecundity, and survivorship. identifying the causes of body size variation is a critical task in ecological and evolutionary research. body size variation along altitudinal gradients has received considerable attention; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. here, we compared the growth rate and age structure of toad-headed lizards (phrynocephalus vlangalii) from two populations found at different elevations in the qinghai-tibetan plateau. we used mark-recapture and skeletochronological analysis to identify the potential proximate causes of altitudinal variation in body size. lizards from the high-elevation site had higher growth rates and attained slightly larger adult body sizes than lizards from the low-elevation site. however, newborns produced by high-elevation females were smaller than those by low-elevation females. von bertalanffy growth estimates predicted high-elevation individuals would reach sexual maturity at an earlier age and have a lower mean age than low-elevation individuals. relatively lower mean age for the high-elevation population was confirmed using the skeletochronological analysis. these results support the prediction that a larger adult body size of high-elevation p.vlangalii results from higher growth rates, associated with higher resource availability."
insights on dispersal and recruitment paradigms: sex-and age-dependent variations in a nomadic breeder,unstable habitats; colonial species; temporary emigration; capture-recapture; multievent models,OECOLOGIA,ACKER P;FRANCESIAZ C;BECHET A;SADOUL N;LESSELLS CM;PIJL AS;BESNARD A,"sex- and age-dependence in recruitment and dispersal are often explained by costs arising from competition for holding a breeding territory over the years-a typical feature of species living in stable habitats. for instance, long-lived birds with male territoriality often exhibit large variation in recruitment age and higher dispersal in females and young individuals. as a corollary, we expected that species with ephemeral habitat suitability, and hence nomadic breeding, would show weak age- and sex-dependence in dispersal and low variation in recruitment age, because territory ownership is not maintained over the years. in addition, the higher cost of reproduction in females might not be (over)compensated for by costs of territoriality in males. accordingly, females would recruit later than males. we explored these variations using multievent capture-recapture models over 13 years, 3479 (2392 sexed) slender-billed gulls (chroicocephalus genei) and 45 colony sites along the french mediterranean coast. as expected, variability in recruitment age was low with males recruiting earlier than females. nonetheless, dispersal in and out of the study area decreased with age and was slightly higher in males than in females. decreased dispersal with age might result from foraging benefits associated with increased spatial familiarity. higher dispersal in males might be explained by a male-biased sex ratio or higher philopatry benefits in females (arising from their higher cost of reproduction). sex- and age-dependent dispersal and recruitment may thus occur in the absence of year-to-year breeding territory ownership, which stresses the importance of considering other processes in shaping recruitment and dispersal patterns."
"optimizing lifetime reproductive output: intermittent breeding as a tactic for females in a long-lived, multiparous mammal",finite-mixture capture-recapture models; individual heterogeneity; life-history trade-offs; mirounga leonina; reproductive costs; state uncertainty,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,DESPREZ M;GIMENEZ O;MCMAHON CR;HINDELL MA;HARCOURT RG,"1. in iteroparous species, intermittent breeding is an important life-history tactic that can greatly affect animal population growth and viability. despite its importance, few studies have quantified the consequences of breeding pauses on lifetime reproductive output, principally because calculating lifetime reproductive output requires knowledge of each individual's entire reproductive history. this information is extremely difficult to obtain in wild populations. 2. we applied novel statistical approaches that account for uncertainty in state assessment and individual heterogeneity to an 18-year capture-recapture dataset of 6,631 female southern elephant seals from macquarie island. we estimated survival and breeding probabilities, and investigated the consequences of intermittent breeding on lifetime reproductive output. 3. we found consistent differences in females' demographic performance between two heterogeneity classes. in particular, breeding imbued a high cost on survival in the females from the heterogeneity class 2, assumed to be females of lower quality. individual quality also appeared to play a major role in a female's decision to skip reproduction with females of poorer quality more likely to skip breeding events than females of higher quality. 4. skipping some breeding events allowed females from both heterogeneity classes to increase lifetime reproductive output over females that bred annually. however, females of lower quality produced less offspring over their lifetime. 5. intermittent breeding seems to be used by female southern elephant seals as a tactic to offset reproductive costs on survival and enhance lifetime reproductive output but remains unavoidable and driven by individual-specific constraints in some other females."
interacting effects of unobserved heterogeneity and individual stochasticity in the life history of the southern fulmar,frailty; individual quality; latent; life expectancy; lifetime reproductive success,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,JENOUVRIER S;AUBRY LM;BARBRAUD C;WEIMERSKIRCH H;CASWELL H,"1. individuals are heterogeneous in many ways. some of these differences are incorporated as individual states (e.g. age, size, breeding status) in population models. however, substantial amounts of heterogeneity may remain unaccounted for, due to unmeasurable genetic, maternal or environmental factors. 2. such unobserved heterogeneity (uh) affects the behaviour of heterogeneous cohorts via intra-cohort selection and contributes to inter-individual variance in demographic outcomes such as longevity and lifetime reproduction. variance is also produced by individual stochasticity, due to random events in the life cycle of wild organisms, yet no study thus far has attempted to decompose the variance in demographic outcomes into contributions from uh and individual stochasticity for an animal population in the wild. 3. we developed a stage-classified matrix population model for the southern fulmar breeding on ile des petrels, antarctica. we applied multievent, multistate mark-recapture methods to estimate a finite mixture model accounting for uh in all vital rates and markov chain methods to calculate demographic outcomes. finally, we partitioned the variance in demographic outcomes into contributions from uh and individual stochasticity. 4. we identify three uh groups, differing substantially in longevity, lifetime reproductive output, age at first reproduction and in the proportion of the life spent in each reproductive state. - 14% of individuals at fledging have a delayed but high probability of recruitment and extended reproductive life span. - 67% of individuals are less likely to reach adulthood, recruit late and skip breeding often but have the highest adult survival rate. - 19% of individuals recruit early and attempt to breed often. they are likely to raise their offspring successfully, but experience a relatively short life span. unobserved heterogeneity only explains a small fraction of the variances in longevity (5.9%), age at first reproduction (3.7%) and lifetime reproduction (22%). 5. uh can affect the entire life cycle, including survival, development and reproductive rates, with consequences over the lifetime of individuals and impacts on cohort dynamics. the respective role of uh vs. individual stochasticity varies greatly among demographic outcomes. we discuss the implication of our finding for the gradient of life-history strategies observed among species and argue that individual differences should be accounted for in demographic studies of wild populations."
generalized spatial mark-resight models with an application to grizzly bears,banff national park; carnivore; grizzly bear; hierarchical model; point process models; population density; remote camera; spatial capture-recapture; spatial mark-resight; telemetry,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,WHITTINGTON J;HEBBLEWHITE M;CHANDLER RB,"1. the high cost associated with capture-recapture studies presents a major challenge when monitoring and managing wildlife populations. recently developed spatial mark-resight (smr) models were proposed as a cost-effective alternative because they only require a single marking event. however, existing smr models ignore the marking process and make the tenuous assumption that marked and unmarked populations have the same encounter probabilities. this assumption will be violated in most situations because the marking process results in different spatial distributions of marked and unmarked animals. 2. we developed a generalized smr model that includes sub-models for the marking and resighting processes, thereby relaxing the assumption that marked and unmarked populations have the same spatial distributions and encounter probabilities. 3. our simulation study demonstrated that conventional smr models produce biased density estimates with low credible interval coverage (cic) when marked and unmarked animals had differing spatial distributions. in contrast, generalized smr models produced unbiased density estimates with correct cic in all scenarios. 4. we applied our smr model to grizzly bear (ursus arctos) data where the marking process occurred along a transportation route through banff and yoho national parks, canada. twenty-two grizzly bears were trapped, fitted with radiocollars and then detected along with unmarked bears on 214 remote cameras. closed population density estimates (posterior median1 sd) averaged from 2012 to 2014 were much lower for conventional smr models (7.41.0 bears per 1,000km(2)) than for generalized smr models (12.4 +/- 1.5). when compared to previous dna-based estimates, conventional smr estimates erroneously suggested a 51% decline in density. conversely, generalized smr estimates were similar to previous estimates, indicating that the grizzly bear population was relatively stable. 5. synthesis and applications. mark-resight studies often cost less than capture-recapture studies, but require that marked and unmarked animals have equal encounter rates. generalized spatial mark-resight models relax this assumption by including sub-models for both the marking and resighting processes. they produce unbiased density estimates even when marked and unmarked animals have differing spatial distributions and encounter rates. they thus provide a cost-effective and widely applicable approach for estimating the density of wildlife populations."
"high genetic structure and low mitochondrial diversity in bottlenose dolphins of the archipelago of bocas del toro, panama: a population at risk?",NA,PLOS ONE,BARRAGAN BARRERA DC;MAY COLLADO LJ;TEZANOS PINTO G;ISLAS VILLANUEVA V;CORREA CARDENAS CA;CABALLERO S,"the current conservation status of the bottlenose dolphin (tursiops truncatus) under the iucn is 'least concern'. however, in the caribbean, small and localized populations of the 'inshore form' may be at higher risk of extinction than the 'worldwide distributed form' due to a combination of factors including small population size, high site fidelity, genetic isolation, and range overlap with human activities. here, we study the population genetic structure of bottlenose dolphins from the archipelago of bocas del toro in panama. this is a small population characterized by high site fidelity and is currently heavily-impacted by the local dolphin- watching industry. we collected skin tissue samples from 25 dolphins to study the genetic diversity and structure of this population. we amplified a portion of the mitochondrial control region (mtdna-cr) and nine microsatellite loci. the mtdna-cr analyses revealed that dolphins in bocas del toro belong to the 'inshore form', grouped with the bahamascolombia- cuba-mexico population unit. they also possess a unique haplotype new for the caribbean. the microsatellite data indicated that the bocas del toro dolphin population is highly structured, likely due to restricted movement patterns. previous abundance estimates obtained with mark-recapture methods reported a small population of 80 dolphins (95% ci = 72-87), which is similar to the contemporary effective population size estimated in this study (ne = 73 individuals; ci = 18.0 - infinity; 0.05). the combination of small population size, high degree of genetic isolation, and intense daily interactions with dolphin-watching boats puts the bocas del toro dolphin to at high risk of extinction. despite national guidelines to regulate the dolphin-watching industry in bocas del toro and ongoing educational programs for tour operators, only in 2012 seven animals have died due to boat collisions. our results suggest that the conservation status of bottlenose dolphins in bocas del toro should be elevated to 'endangered' at the national level, as a precautionary measure while population and viability estimates are conducted."
estimating dispersal rates of steller sea lion (eumetopias jubatus) mother-pup pairs from a natal rookery using mark-resight data,NA,PLOS ONE,KUHN CE;CHUMBLEY K;FRITZ L;JOHNSON D,"to monitor population trends of steller sea lions (eumetopias jubatus) in alaska, newborn pups are counted during aerial surveys. these surveys are scheduled to occur after the majority of pups are born, but before pups begin to spend significant time in the water. some studies have reported dispersal of mother-pup pairs away from breeding beaches during the pupping season (july), which may influence survey results. using a multistate mark-recapture model with state uncertainty, we estimated the amount of dispersal during the pupping season based on observations of permanently marked sea lions. research was conducted at land-based observation sites on marmot island, alaska, between 2000 and 2013. both marked adult females with dependent pups and marked pups were observed at two rookery beaches from may to july. cumulative dispersal rates were minimal (< 1%) prior to the planned start of the aerial survey (23 june) and increased to 11.2% by the planned survey completion date (10 july). the increased cumulative dispersal rate during the remainder of the observation period (end of july) suggests potential bias in surveys that occur beyond 10 july, however surveys past this date are rare (< 10% between 1973 and 2016). as a result, movements of mother-pup pairs during the pupping season are not likely to influence aerial survey estimates."
response of pumas (puma concolor) to migration of their primary prey in patagonia,NA,PLOS ONE,GELIN ML;BRANCH LC;THORNTON DH;NOVARO AJ;GOULD MJ;CARAGIULO A,"large-scale ungulate migrations result in changes in prey availability for top predators and, as a consequence, can alter predator behavior. migration may include entire populations of prey species, but often prey populations exhibit partial migration with some individuals remaining resident and others migrating. interactions of migratory prey and predators have been documented in north america and some other parts of the world, but are poorly studied in south america. we examined the response of pumas (puma concolor) to seasonal migration of guanacos (lama guanicoe) in la payunia reserve in northern patagonia argentina, which is the site of the longest known ungulate migration in south america. more than 15,000 guanacos migrate seasonally in this landscape, and some guanacos also are resident year-round. we hypothesized that pumas would respond to the guanaco migration by consuming more alternative prey rather than migrating with guanacos because of the territoriality of pumas and availability of alternative prey throughout the year at this site. to determine whether pumas moved seasonally with the guanacos, we conducted camera trapping in the summer and winter range of guanacos across both seasons and estimated density of pumas with spatial mark-resight (smr) models. also, we analyzed puma scats to assess changes in prey consumption in response to guanaco migration. density estimates of pumas did not change significantly in the winter and summer range of guanacos when guanacos migrated to and from these areas, indicating that pumas do not follow the migration of guanacos. pumas also did not consume more alternative native prey or livestock when guanaco availability was lower, but rather fed primarily on guanacos and some alternative prey during all seasons. alternative prey were most common in the diet during summer when guanacos also were abundant on the summer range. the response of pumas to the migration of guanacos differs from sites in the western north america where entire prey populations migrate and pumas migrate with their prey or switch to more abundant prey when their primary prey migrates."
does forest extent affect salamander survival? evidence from a long-term demographic study of a tropical newt,core terrestrial habitat; mark-recapture; paramesotriton hongkongensis; robust design; salamandridae,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,LAU A;KARRAKER NE;DUDGEON D,"forest loss has been associated with reduced survival in many vertebrates, and previous research on amphibians has mostly focused on effects at early life stages. paramesotriton hongkongensis is a tropical newt that breeds in streams but spends up to 10months per year in terrestrial habitats. populations are threatened by habitat degradation and collection for the pet trade, but the cryptic terrestrial lifestyle of this newt has limited our understanding of its population ecology, which inhibits development of a species-specific conservation plan. we conducted an eight-year (2007-2014) mark-recapture study on four p. hongkongensis populations in hong kong and used these data to evaluate relationships between forest cover, body size, and rainfall on survival and to estimate population sizes. hong kong has been subjected to repeated historic territory-wide deforestation, and thus, we wanted to determine whether there was a link between forest extent as a proxy of habitat quality and newt demography. annual survival was positively associated with forest cover within core habitat of all populations and negatively related to body size. mean annual survival (similar to 60%) was similar to that of other stream-dwelling amphibians, but varied among years and declined substantially in 2012-2013, perhaps due to illegal collection. despite the link between forest extent and survival, population sizes declined at the most forested site by 40% and increased by 104% and 134% at two others. forest protection and consequential secondary succession during recent decades in hong kong may have been responsible for persistence of p. hongkongensis populations."
"quantifying long-term population growth rates of threatened bull trout: challenges, lessons learned, and opportunities",NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,BUDY PE;BOWERMAN T;AL CHOKHACHY R;CONNER M;SCHALLER H,"temporal symmetry models (tsm) represent advances in the analytical application of mark-recapture data to population status assessments. for a population of char, we employed 10 years of active and passive mark-recapture data to quantify population growth rates using different data sources and analytical approaches. estimates of adult population growth rate were 1.01 (95% confidence interval = 0.84-1.20) using a temporal symmetry model (lambda(tsm)), 0.96 (0.68-1.34) based on logistic regressions of annual snorkel data (lambda(a)), and 0.92 (0.77-1.11) from redd counts (lambda(r)). top-performing tsms included an increasing time trend in recruitment (f) and changes in capture probability (p). there was only a 1% chance the population decreased >= 50%, and a 10% chance it decreased >= 30% (lambda(mcmc); based on bayesian markov chain monte carlo procedure). size structure was stable; however, the adult population was dominated by small adults, and over the study period there was a decline in the contribution of large adults to total biomass. juvenile condition decreased with increasing adult densities. utilization of these different information sources provided a robust weight-of-evidence approach to identifying population status and potential mechanisms driving changes in population growth rates."
reliable effective number of breeders/adult census size ratios in seasonal-breeding species: opportunity for integrative demographic inferences based on capture-mark-recapture data and multilocus genotypes,amphibians; demography; mating system; polygamy; sample size; sibship size prior,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SANCHEZ MONTES G;WANG JL;ARINO AH;VIZMANOS JL;MARTINEZ SOLANO I,"the ratio of the effective number of breeders (n-b) to the adult census size (n-a), n-b/n-a, approximates the departure from the standard capacity of a population to maintain genetic diversity in one reproductive season. this information is relevant for assessing population status, understanding evolutionary processes operating at local scales, and unraveling how life-history traits affect these processes. however, our knowledge on n-b/n-a ratios in nature is limited because estimation of both parameters is challenging. the sibship frequency (sf) method is adequate for reliable n-b estimation because it is based on sibship and parentage reconstruction from genetic marker data, thereby providing demographic inferences that can be compared with field-based information. in addition, capture-mark-recapture (cmr) robust design methods are well suited for n-a estimation in seasonal-breeding species. we used tadpole genotypes of three pond-breeding amphibian species (epidalea calamita, hyla molleri, and pelophylax perezi, n=73-96 single-cohort tadpoles/species genotyped at 15-17 microsatellite loci) and candidate parental genotypes (n=94-300 adults/species) to estimate n-b by the sf method. to assess the reliability of n-b estimates, we compared sibship and parentage inferences with field-based information and checked for the convergence of results in replicated subsampled analyses. finally, we used cmr data from a 6-year monitoring program to estimate annual n-a in the three species and calculate the n-b/n-a ratio. reliable ratios were obtained for e.calamita (n-b/n-a=0.18-0.28) and p.perezi (0.5), but in h.molleri, n-a could not be estimated and genetic information proved insufficient for reliable n-b estimation. integrative demographic studies taking full advantage of sf and cmr methods can provide accurate estimates of the n-b/n-a ratio in seasonal-breeding species. importantly, the sf method provides results that can be readily evaluated for reliability. this represents a good opportunity for obtaining robust demographic inferences with wide applications for evolutionary and conservation research."
examining the occupancy-density relationship for a low-density carnivore,carnivore; density estimation; detection-non-detection data; fisher; hair snares; non-invasive sampling; occupancy; pekania pennanti; remote cameras; spatial capture-recapture,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,LINDEN DW;FULLER AK;ROYLE JA;HARE MP,"1. the challenges associated with monitoring low-density carnivores across large landscapes have limited the ability to implement and evaluate conservation and management strategies for such species. non-invasive sampling techniques and advanced statistical approaches havealleviated some of these challenges and can even allow for spatially explicit estimates of density, one of the most valuable wildlife monitoring tools. 2. for some species, individual identification comes at no cost when unique attributes (e.g. pelage patterns) can be discerned with remote cameras, while other species require viable genetic material and expensive laboratory processing for individual assignment. prohibitive costs may still force monitoring efforts to use species distribution or occupancy as a surrogate for density, which may not be appropriate under many conditions. 3. here, we used a large-scale monitoring study of fisher pekania pennanti to evaluate the effectiveness of occupancy as an approximation to density, particularly for informing harvest management decisions. we combined remote cameras with baited hair snares during 2013-2015 to sample across a 70096-km(2) region of western new york, usa. we fit occupancy and royle-nichols models to species detection-non-detection data collected by cameras, and spatial capture-recapture (scr) models to individual encounter data obtained by genotyped hair samples. variation in the state variables within 15-km(2) grid cells was modelled as a function of landscape attributes known to influence fisher distribution. 4. we found a close relationship between grid cell estimates of fisher state variables from the models using detection-non-detection data and those from the scr model, likely due to informative spatial covariates across a large landscape extent and a grid cell resolution that worked well with the movement ecology of the species. fisher occupancy and density were both positively associated with the proportion of coniferous-mixed forest and negatively associated with road density. as a result, spatially explicit management recommendations for fisher were similar across models, though relative variation was dampened for the detection-non-detection data. 5. synthesis and applications. our work provides empirical evidence that models using detection-non-detection data can make similar inferences regarding relative spatial variation of the focal population to models using more expensive individual encounters when the selected spatial grain approximates or is marginally smaller than home range size. when occupancy alone is chosen as a cost-effective state variable for monitoring, simulation and sensitivity analyses should be used to understand how inferences from detection-non-detection data will be affected by aspects of study design and species ecology."
are removal-based abundance models robust to fish behavior?,depletion estimate; removal estimate; bias; mark recapture; abundance; fish behavior,FISHERIES RESEARCH,VAN POORTEN BT;BARRETT B;WALTERS CJ;AHRENS RNM,"removal methods are some of the most common statistical tools for estimating fish abundance in streams and lakes, yet they are prone to produce biased estimates when the assumption of constant capture probability is violated. in response, numerous authors have modified the classic removal models to control for non-constant capture probability. a variety of fish behaviors can cause capture, probability to vary across individuals or over time, such as dominance hierarchies, escaping capture or persistent individual differences in capture probability due to activity or aggression; yet knowing exactly which behaviors may affect capture probability is generally unknown. we assessed the robustness of five removal models (i.e., the leslie model, three behavior-dependent models and a density dependent capture probability model) and their ability to provide consistently accurate and precise abundance estimates irrespective of the exhibited behavior. we fitted each model to catch data generated from five behavioral models that mimicked a range of animal behaviors in a closed population. additionally, we evaluated the improvements that can be gained by including marked fish in the removal process and in that case, compared estimation models with a peterson mark-recapture estimation. results indicate that no single removal model is robust to non-constant capture probability, however, the density-dependent capture probability model performed moderately better than other models when only removal data were used. we found that the addition of marked fish results in a substantial improvement in accuracy and precision across all removal models when mark-recapture assumptions are met. however, these improvements diminished substantially when mark-recapture assumptions were violated. due to the difficulties in assessing assumptions, our findings suggest that including marked fish in the removal process may unknowingly reduce accuracy and precision of initial abundance estimate and that this type of experimental design should be avoided in many instances."
"vertical organization of the division of labor within nests of the florida harvester ant, pogonomyrmex badius",NA,PLOS ONE,TSCHINKEL WR;HANLEY N,"in the florida harvester ant, pogonomyrmex badius, foragers occur only in the top 15 cm of the nest, whereas brood and brood-care workers reside mostly in the deepest regions, yet the food and seeds foragers collect must be transported downward 30 to 80 cm to seed chambers and up to 2 m to brood chambers. using mark-recapture techniques with fluorescent printer's ink, we identified a class of workers that ranges widely within the vertical structure of the nest, rapidly moving materials dropped by foragers in the upper regions downward, and excavated soil from deeper upward. within the nest, only 5% of foragers were recovered below 20 cm depth, but about 30% of transfer workers and 82% of unmarked workers were found there. below 70 cm depth, 90% of workers were unmarked, and were probably involved mostly in brood care. during the summer, the transfer workers comprise about a quarter of the nest population, while foragers make up about 40%. workers marked as transfer workers later appear as foragers, while those marked as foragers die and disappear from the foraging population, suggesting that transfer workers are younger, and age into foraging. the importance of these findings for laboratory studies of division of labor are discussed. the efficient allocation of labor is a key component of superorganismal fitness."
"genetic health and population monitoring of two small black bear (ursus americanus) populations in alabama, with a regional perspective of genetic diversity and exchange",NA,PLOS ONE,DRAPER JP;WAITS LP;ADAMS JR;SEALS CL;STEURY TD,"one of the major concerns in conservation today is the loss of genetic diversity which is a frequent consequence of population isolation and small population sizes. fragmentation of populations and persecution of carnivores has posed a substantial threat to the persistence of free ranging carnivores in north america since the arrival of european settlers. black bears have seen significant reductions in range size from their historic extent, which is most pronounced in the southeastern united states and even more starkly in alabama where until recently bears were reduced to a single geographically isolated population in the mobile river basin. recently a second population has naturally re-established itself in northeastern alabama. we sought to determine size, genetic diversity and genetic connectivity for these two populations in relation to other regional populations. both populations of black bears in alabama had small population sizes and had moderate to low genetic diversity, but showed different levels of connectivity to surrounding populations of bears. the mobile river basin population had a small population size at only 86 individuals (76-124, 95% c.i.), the lowest genetic diversity of compared populations (richness = 2.33, ho and he = 0.33), and showed near complete genetic isolation from surrounding populations across multiple tests. the newly recolonizing population in northeastern alabama had a small but growing population doubling in 3 years (34 individuals 26-43, 95% c.i.), relatively moderate genetic diversity compared to surrounding populations (richness = 3.32, ho = 0.53, he = 0.65), and showed a high level of genetic connectivity with surrounding populations."
using data from respondent-driven sampling studies to estimate the number of people who inject drugs: application to the kohtla-jarve region of estonia,NA,PLOS ONE,WU JC;CRAWFORD FW;RAAG M;HEIMER R;UUSKULA A,"estimating the size of key risk populations is essential for determining the resources needed to implement effective public health intervention programs. several standard methods for population size estimation exist, but the statistical and practical assumptions required for their use may not be met when applied to hiv risk groups. we apply three approaches to estimate the number of people who inject drugs (pwid) in the kohtla-jarve region of estonia using data from a respondent-driven sampling (rds) study: the standard ""multiplier"" estimate gives 654 people (95% ci 509-804), the ""successive sampling"" method gives estimates between 600 and 2500 people, and a network-based estimate that uses the rds recruitment chain gives between 700 and 2800 people. we critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of these statistical approaches for estimating the size of hidden or hard-to-reach hiv risk groups."
using multiple data types and integrated population models to improve our knowledge of apex predator population dynamics,bayesian; brown bear; hierarchical modeling; integrated population model; kodiak island; ursus arctos,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BLED F;BELANT JL;VAN DAELE LJ;SVOBODA N;GUSTINE D;HILDERBRAND G;BARNES VG,"current management of large carnivores is informed using a variety of parameters, methods, and metrics; however, these data are typically considered independently. sharing information among data types based on the underlying ecological, and recognizing observation biases, can improve estimation of individual and global parameters. we present a general integrated population model (ipm), specifically designed for brown bears (ursus arctos), using three common data types for bear (u. spp.) populations: repeated counts, capture-mark-recapture, and litter size. we considered factors affecting ecological and observation processes for these data. we assessed the practicality of this approach on a simulated population and compared estimates from our model to values used for simulation and results from count data only. we then present a practical application of this general approach adapted to the constraints of a case study using historical data available for brown bears on kodiak island, alaska, usa. the ipm provided more accurate and precise estimates than models accounting for repeated count data only, with credible intervals including the true population 94% and 5% of the time, respectively. for the kodiak population, we estimated annual average litter size (within one year after birth) to vary between 0.45 [95% credible interval: 0.43; 0.55] and 1.59 [1.55; 1.82]. we detected a positive relationship between salmon availability and adult survival, with survival probabilities greater for females than males. survival probabilities increased from cubs to yearlings to dependent young 2years old and decreased with litter size. linking multiple information sources based on ecological and observation mechanisms can provide more accurate and precise estimates, to better inform management. ipms can also reduce data collection efforts by sharing information among agencies and management units. our approach responds to an increasing need in bear populations' management and can be readily adapted to other large carnivores."
using bayesian mark-recapture modelling to quantify the strength and duration of post-release effects in reintroduced populations,reintroduction; translocation; survival; mark-recapture; bayesian; openbugs,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ARMSTRONG DP;LE COEUR C;THORNE JM;PANFYLOVA J;LOVEGROVE TG;FROST PGH;EWEN JG,"translocated animals often suffer elevated mortality during some acclimation period after release. such post release effects must be accounted for when estimating normal survival rates and therefore predicting population persistence. the standard approach for doing this is to nominate a fixed acclimation period, and either i) exclude survival data over that period, or ii) use model selection criteria to test whether survival differs over that period. we present a more flexible approach where the acclimation period is treated as unknown and is estimated simultaneously with the pre- and post-acclimation survival probabilities. we illustrate this approach using survival data for six reintroduced populations involving three new zealand forest bird species. analyses of the complete data sets (22-73 surveys conducted over 4-14 years) indicated that significant post-release effects occurred in at least one sex in five of the six populations, with 30-84% mortality attributable to post-release effects over acclimation periods ranging from 1 to 9 months. when we applied the approach to just the first year of data for each population, the estimated normal survival rates were consistent with those obtained from the complete data sets, and always at least as accurate as our previous approach of excluding data up to the next breeding season after translocation. the flexible approach therefore appears to be effective for accounting for post-release effects in survival estimation, and is beneficial in quantifying both the strength and duration of those effects so that pre- and post-release management strategies are better informed."
space oddity: the mission for spatial integration,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,BERGER AM;GOETHEL DR;LYNCH PD;QUINN T;MORMEDE S;MCKENZIE J;DUNN A,"fishery management decisions are commonly guided by stock assessment models that aggregate outputs across the spatial domain of the species. with refined understanding of spatial population structures, scientists have begun to address how spatiotemporal mismatches among the scale of ecological processes, data collection programs, and stock assessment methods (or assumptions) influence the reliability and, ultimately, appropriateness of regional fishery management (e.g., assigning regional quotas). development and evaluation of spatial modeling techniques to improve fisheries assessment and management have increased rapidly in recent years. we overview the historical context of spatial models in fisheries science, highlight recent advances in spatial modeling, and discuss how spatial models have been incorporated into the management process. despite limited examples where spatial assessment models are used as the basis for management advice, continued investment in fine-scale data collection and associated spatial analyses will improve integration of spatial dynamics and ecosystem-level interactions in stock assessment. in the near future, spatiotemporal fisheries management advice will increasingly rely on fine-scale outputs from spatial analyses."
the robustness of brownie tag return models to complex spatiotemporal dynamics evaluated through simulation analysis,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,LAURETTA MV;GOETHEL DR,"the development of a reliable tagging program requires simulation testing the experimental design. however, the potential for model misspecification, particularly in the underlying spatiotemporal dynamics, is often ignored. a continuous time, spatially explicit, age-structured, capture-recapture operating model was developed to better emulate real-world population dynamics typically overlooked in spatially aggregated or discrete time tagging models. various spatiotemporal model parametrizations, including case studies with atlantic bluefin tuna (thunnus thynnus) and yellowfin tuna (thunnus albacares), were explored to evaluate the bias associated with brownie tag return estimation models. simulations demonstrated that accounting for connectivity was essential for obtaining unbiased parameter estimates and that migration rates could be reliably estimated without the correlation associated with other parameters (e.g., between tag reporting and mortality). mortality parameter estimates were particularly sensitive to the temporal dynamics of the tagging and fishing seasons, but accounting for the seasonality in tag releases and fishery recaptures allowed for relatively unbiased estimation. our results indicate that parameter bias and uncertainty can be severely underestimated when discrete time or spatially aggregated operating models are used to determine optimal experimental design of tagging studies."
"simulation testing the robustness of a multiregion, tag-integrated assessment model that exhibits natal homing and estimates natural mortality and reporting rate",NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,VINCENT MT;BRENDEN TO;BENCE JR,"the influence of model complexity on integrated tagging and catch-at-age analysis (itcaan) parameter estimation is poorly understood for populations exhibiting natal homing. we investigated itcaan performance under varying levels of movement, degree of similarity in population productivities, data quality, spatial complexity in parameterization, and whether natural mortality and (or) reporting rates were fixed at actual values, estimated, or misspecified. dynamics of four populations with natal homing that intermixed during periods of harvest were simulated based on lake erie walleye (sander vitreus). our results suggest, when high-quality tagging data are available, itcaan models are able to simultaneously estimate movement rates, natural mortality, and tag reporting rates, though accuracy and precision of model estimates will decrease with greater model complexity and fewer tags released. additionally, itcaan models may have difficulty estimating individual population abundances under certain movement rates when population productivities are vastly different. itcaan models that estimate natural mortality and reporting rates may perform best with similar sized populations and when data are available to assist the estimation of reporting rates."
from gestation to weaning: combining robust design and multi-event models unveils cost of lactation in a large herbivore,cmr; individual heterogeneity; juvenile survival; pyrenean chamois rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica; reproductive success; trade-offs; ungulates,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,RICHARD Q;TOIGO C;APPOLINAIRE J;LOISON A;GAREL M,"the cost of current reproduction on survival or future reproduction is one of the most studied trade-offs governing resource distribution between fitness components. results have often been clouded, however, by the existence of individual heterogeneity, with high-quality individuals able to allocate energy to several functions simultaneously, at no apparent cost. surprisingly, it has also rarely been assessed within a breeding season by breaking down the various reproductive efforts of females from gestation to weaning, even though resource availability and energy requirements vary greatly. we filled this gap by using an intensively monitored population of pyrenean chamois and by expanding a new methodological approach integrating robust design in a multi-event framework. we distinguished females that gave birth or not, and among reproducing females whether they lost their kid or successfully raised it until weaning. we estimated spring and summer juvenile survival, investigated whether gestation, lactation or weaning incurred costs on the next reproductive occasion, and assessed how individual heterogeneity influenced the detection of such costs. contrary to expectations if trade-offs occur, we found a positive relationship between gestation and adult survival suggesting that non-breeding females are in poor condition. costs of reproduction were expressed through negative relationships between lactation and both subsequent breeding probability and spring juvenile survival. such costs could be detected only once individual heterogeneity (assessed as two groups contrasting good vs. poor breeders) and time variations in juvenile survival were accounted for. early lactation decreased the probability of future reproduction, providing quantitative evidence of the fitness cost of this period recognized as the most energetically demanding in female mammals and critical for neonatal survival. the new approach employed made it possible to estimate two components of kid survival that are often considered practically unavailable in free-ranging populations, and also revealed that reproductive costs appeared only when contrasting the different stages of reproductive effort. from an evolutionary perspective, our findings stressed the importance of the temporal resolution at which reproductive cost is studied, and also provided insights on the reproductive period during which internal and external factors would be expected to have the greatest fitness impact."
state-space mark-recapture estimates reveal a recent decline in abundance of north atlantic right whales,bayesian mark-recapture; eubalaena glacialis; open population abundance; recovery; survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,PACE RM;CORKERON PJ;KRAUS SD,"north atlantic right whales (eubalaena glacialis muller 1776) present an interesting problem for abundance and trend estimation in marine wildlife conservation. they are long lived, individually identifiable, highly mobile, and one of the rarest of cetaceans. individuals are annually resighted at different rates, primarily due to varying stay durations among several principal habitats within a large geographic range. to date, characterizations of abundance have been produced that use simple accounting procedures with differing assumptions about mortality. to better characterize changing abundance of north atlantic right whales between 1990 and 2015, we adapted a state-space formulation with jolly-seber assumptions about population entry (birth and immigration) to individual resighting histories and fit it using empirical bayes methodology. this hierarchical model included accommodation for the effect of the substantial individual capture heterogeneity. estimates from this approach were only slightly higher than published accounting procedures, except for the most recent years (when recapture rates had declined substantially). north atlantic right whales' abundance increased at about 2.8% per annum from median point estimates of 270 individuals in 1990 to 483 in 2010, and then declined to 2015, when the final estimate was 458 individuals (95% credible intervals 444-471). the probability that the population's trajectory post-2010 was a decline was estimated at 99.99%. of special concern was the finding that reduced survival rates of adult females relative to adult males have produced diverging abundance trends between sexes. despite constraints in recent years, both biological (whales' distribution changing) and logistical (fewer resources available to collect individual photo-identifications), it is still possible to detect this relatively recent, small change in the population's trajectory. this is thanks to the massive dataset of individual north atlantic right whale identifications accrued over the past three decades. photo-identification data provide biological information that allows more informed inference on the status of this species."

density-dependent signaling: an alternative hypothesis on the function of chemical signaling in a non-territorial solitary carnivore,NA,PLOS ONE,LAMB CT;MOWAT G;GILBERT SL;MCLELLAN BN;NIELSEN SE;BOUTIN S,"brown bears are known to use rubbing behavior as a means of chemical communication, but the function of this signaling is unclear. one hypothesis that has gained support is that male bears rub to communicate dominance to other males. we tested the communication of dominance hypothesis in a low-density brown bear population in southeast british columbia. we contrasted rubbing rates for male and female bears during and after the breeding season using ten years of dna-mark-recapture data for 643 individuals. here we demonstrate that male brown bears rub 60% more during the breeding than the non-breeding season, while female rubbing had no seasonal trends. per capita rub rates by males were, on average, 2.7 times higher than females. our results suggest that the function of rubbing in the rocky mountains may not only be to communicate dominance, but also to self-advertise for mate attraction. we propose that the role of chemical communication in this species may be density-dependent, where the need to self-advertise for mating is inversely related to population density and communicating for dominance increases with population density. we suggest that future endeavors to elucidate the function of rubbing should sample the behavior across a range of population densities using camera trap and genotypic data."
mismeasured mortality: correcting estimates of wolf poaching in the united states,carnivore; endangered species; illegal; lethal control; mark-recapture; regulated take,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,TREVES A;ARTELLE KA;DARIMONT CT;PARSONS DR,"measuring rates and causes of mortalities is important in animal ecology and management. observing the fates of known individuals is a common method of estimating life history variables, including mortality patterns. it has long been assumed that data lost when known animals disappear were unbiased. we test and reject this assumption under conditions common to most, if not all, studies using marked animals. we illustrate the bias for 4 endangered wolf populations in the united states by reanalyzing data and assumptions about the known and unknown fates of marked wolves to calculate the degree to which risks of different causes of death were mismeasured. we find that, when using traditional methods, the relative risk of mortality from legal killing measured as a proportion of all known fates was overestimated by 0.05-0.16 and the relative risk of poaching was underestimated by 0.17-0.44. we show that published government estimates are affected by these biases and, importantly, are underestimating the risk of poaching. the underestimates have obscured the magnitude of poaching as the major threat to endangered wolf populations. we offer methods to correct estimates of mortality risk for marked animals of any taxon and describe the conditions under which traditional methods produce more or less bias. we also show how correcting past and future estimates of mortality parameters can address uncertainty about wildlife populations and increase the predictability and sustainability of wildlife management interventions."
ecological and phenotypic effects on survival and habitat transitions of white-footed mice,fitness; habitat type; mark-recapture; multi-state model; peromyscus leucopus; space familiarity,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,HANNEBAUM SL;BROWN CR;BOOTH W,"animals often confine their movements to familiar areas and preferred habitats, resulting in increased fitness through enhanced survival and reproduction. however, the link between preferential habitat use and fitness is rarely tested, especially when individual phenotype is considered. through multi-state modeling of mark-recapture data, we assessed the influence of habitat type, sex, and body size on the daily survival and habitat-transition probabilities of white-footed mice (peromyscus leucopus). habitat states tested were forest edge versus forest interior, and grassy versus shrubby habitat. females were more likely to survive than males, and mass had a positive effect, whereas foot length a negative effect on survival. females were more likely to exhibit habitat-type fidelity between edge and interior states than males. body mass negatively affected daily transition between edge and interior, whereas foot length had a positive effect. individuals were most likely to remain within the shrubby habitat and leave the grassy habitat. mass had a negative effect on daily transition probability between grassy and shrubby habitats, foot length had a positive effect, and sex had no effect. individuals with the greatest probability of moving between habitat types had the lowest probability of survival, likely a result of occupying unfamiliar space. our results show that white-footed mice in general seem to select habitat types where fitness expectations are likely to be greatest, but that transitions between habitats often depend on phenotypic characteristics of individuals."
"populations and activity patterns of clouded leopards and marbled cats in dampa tiger reserve, india",activity patterns; clouded leopard; conservation; ecology; felids; lushai hills; marbled cat; population,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,SINGH P;MACDONALD DW,"the rapidly declining tropical forests of asia support a diversity of felid species, many of which are rare and little known. we used camera traps in dampa tiger reserve (tr), mizoram, northeastern india, to estimate population density and describe activity patterns of 2 rare felids, the clouded leopard (neofelis nebulosa) and marbled cat (pardofelis marmorata). with a survey effort of 4,962 trap nights, we obtained 84 photo-captures of clouded leopards and 36 of marbled cats. we used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to estimate population densities of both species. using the bayesian approach implemented in spacecap, we derived estimates of 5.14 (+/- 1.80 sd)/100 km(2) for clouded leopards and 5.03 (+/- 2.07 sd)/100 km(2) for marbled cats. using camera-trap images, we compared diel activity patterns and activity overlaps for these 2 rare felids, together with 3 other sympatric carnivores, by estimating a coefficient of overlap between species. among felids, clouded leopards and golden cats (catopuma temminckii) displayed the highest overlap in activity, whereas marbled cats and leopard cats (prionailurus bengalensis) showed the lowest, with marbled cats being primarily diurnal and leopard cats nocturnal. our study provides the first density estimates from continental southeast asia for marbled cats and one of the highest recorded densities for clouded leopards. these results are of special significance since dampa sustains an ecosystem that has in recent times undergone near extirpation of large predators."
data integration for inference about spatial processes: a model-based approach to test and account for data inconsistency,NA,PLOS ONE,TENAN S;PEDRINI P;BRAGALANTI N;GROFF C;SUTHERLAND C,"recently-developed methods that integrate multiple data sources arising from the same ecological processes have typically utilized structured data from well-defined sampling protocols (e.g., capture-recapture and telemetry). despite this new methodological focus, the value of opportunistic data for improving inference about spatial ecological processes is unclear and, perhaps more importantly, no procedures are available to formally test whether parameter estimates are consistent across data sources and whether they are suitable for integration. using data collected on the reintroduced brown bear population in the italian alps, a population of conservation importance, we combined data from three sources: traditional spatial capture-recapture data, telemetry data, and opportunistic data. we developed a fully integrated spatial capture-recapture (scr) model that included a model-based test for data consistency to first compare model estimates using different combinations of data, and then, by acknowledging data-type differences, evaluate parameter consistency. we demonstrate that opportunistic data lend itself naturally to integration within the scr framework and highlight the value of opportunistic data for improving inference about space use and population size. this is particularly relevant in studies of rare or elusive species, where the number of spatial encounters is usually small and where additional observations are of high value. in addition, our results highlight the importance of testing and accounting for inconsistencies in spatial information from structured and unstructured data so as to avoid the risk of spurious or averaged estimates of space use and consequently, of population size. our work supports the use of a single modeling framework to combine spatially-referenced data while also accounting for parameter consistency."
larval assemblages of large saproxylic cerambycids in iberian oak forests: wood quality and host preference shape resource partitioning,cerambyx; ecological succession; niche differentiation; oak decline; prinobius; sympatry,POPULATION ECOLOGY,TORRES VILA LM;ZUGASTI MARTINEZ C;MENDIOLA DIAZ FJ;DE JUAN MURILLO JM;SANCHEZ GONZALEZ A;CONEJO RODRIGUEZ Y;PONCE ESCUDERO F;FERNANDEZ MORENO F,"oak open woodlands are widespread in southwestern iberia and present outstanding ecological, biodiversity and socio-economic values. evergreen species (holm and cork oaks) are prevalent but deciduous oaks may be also locally important. three large xylophagous cerambycids are associated to these oaks, cerambyx welensii (cw), c. cerdo (cc) and prinobius myardi (pm). like other saproxylic insects, these cerambycids are essential to the nutrient cycle, wood degradation and tree hollow formation, significantly contributing to biodiversity in oak forests. these cerambycids may also potentially colonise healthy living trees and become harmful or pest species. factors driving their larval ecology are almost unknown, especially in oak forests harbouring mixed populations living in sympatry. wood samples (n = 500 bolts) from 348 colonised trees were examined during 2011-2016 across the extremadura region (41,634 km(2)). bolts were measured, scored into five wood quality classes, dissected, and all target cerambycids were collected, measured, reared and taxonomically identified. we then determined species-specific prevalence, niche breadth, niche overlap, age structure and population density depending on wood quality, host preference, tree part, wood size, altitude and sun exposure. wood quality and host preference were major factors segregating interspecific resource partitioning. cw was prevalent on cork oak decayed wood, and pm on holm oak degraded wood. host tree part was involved in cerambyx larval niche segregation, with cw prevalent in the fork/branches and cc in the trunk/base. pm was never found inhabiting deciduous oaks. our results may be useful to improve sustainable forest management practices in iberian oak open woodlands."
controlling invasive predators enhances the long-term survival of endangered new zealand long-tailed bats (chalinolobus tuberculatus): implications for conservation of bats on oceanic islands,mammals; rats; mustelids; predator control; climate change; population models,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,O DONNELL CFJ;PRYDE MA;VAN DAM BATES P;ELLIOTT GP,"invasive mammalian predators pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity globally, particularly on oceanic islands. however, little is known about the impacts of these invasive predators on bats (chiroptera), one of the most specious mammal groups, and one of the most widespread groups of mammals threatened on oceanic islands (> 200 spp.). nearly 50% of the world's threatened bats are island endemics and because they are often the only native mammals on islands, they fulfil important ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal. long-tailed bats (chalinolobus tuberculatus) are critically endangered because of predation by exotic mammals, particularly ship rats (rattus ratios), introduced by humans to the island archipelago of new zealand. we monitored the survival of bats in three colonies in temperate rainforest in fiordland over 22 years. since 2009, we controlled predators during irruption phases and compared survival of bats in previously untreated areas with survival in forest blocks treated using rodenticides deployed in bait stations. survival was estimated using multi-state mark-recapture models in program mark 7.0 with > 15,000 bats tagged. survival was primarily dependent on year and age of bats, although seedfall intensity of the dominant canopy tree and predator management was also influential. survival in long-tailed bats was as high as, or higher, than figures for bats generally in years with low predator numbers or predator control. survival was markedly higher in treatment years when predators were managed (0.82 compared to 0.55). population modelling indicated managed colonies will increase (lambda > 1.05) whereas unmanaged colonies will decline (lambda = 0.89 - 0.98) under scenarios that reflect increased frequency of beech mast and predator irruptions. thus, effective predator control is essential for recovering long-tailed bat populations. warming temperatures indicate that predator irruptions are becoming more frequent, which would require more predator control in the future than at present if declines in bat populations are to be reversed. these results are relevant to the conservation of threatened bats on oceanic islands, given the abundance of exotic mammalian predators, particularly ship rats, on them."
designing cost-effective capture-recapture surveys for improving the monitoring of survival in bird populations,"survey design; optimisation; statistical power; cost efficiency, stage-structured population",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,LIEURY N;DEVILLARD S;BESNARD A;GIMENEZ O;HAMEAU O;PONCHON C;MILLON A,"population monitoring traditionally relies on population counts, accounting or not for the issue of detectability. however, this approach does not permit to go into details on demographic processes. therefore, capture-recapture (cr) surveys have become popular tools for scientists and practitioners willing to measure survival response to environmental change or conservation actions. however, cr surveys are expensive and their design is often driven by the available resources, without estimation about the level of precision they provide for detecting changes in survival, despite optimising resource allocation in wildlife monitoring is increasingly important. investigating how cr surveys could be optimised by manipulating resource allocation among different design components is therefore critically needed. we have conducted a simulation experiment exploring the statistical power of a wide range of cr survey designs to detect changes in the survival rate of birds. cr surveys differ in terms of number of breeding pairs monitored, number of offspring and adults marked, resighting effort and survey duration. we compared open-nest (on) and nest-box (nb) monitoring types, using medium- and long-lived model species. increasing survey duration and number of pairs monitored increased statistical power. long survey duration can provide accurate estimations for long-lived birds even for small population size (15 pairs). a cost-benefit analysis revealed that for long-lived on species, ringing as many chicks as possible appears as the most effective survey component, unless a technique for capturing breeding birds at low cost is available to compensate for reduced local recruitment. for medium-lived nb species, focusing the nb rounds at a period that maximises the chance to capture breeding females inside nest-boxes is more rewarding than ringing all chicks. we show that integrating economic costs is crucial when designing cr surveys and discuss ways to improve efficiency by reducing duration to a time scale compatible with management and conservation issues."
understanding inter-reach variation in brown trout (salmo trutta) mortality rates using a hierarchical bayesian state-space model,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,BRET V;CAPRA H;GOURAUD V;LAMOUROUX N;PIFFADY J;TISSOT L;RIVOT E,"successful management and protection of wild animal populations relies on good understanding of their life cycles. because population dynamics depends on intricate interactions of biological and ecological processes at various scales, new approaches are needed that account for the variability of demographic processes and associated parameters in a hierarchy of spatial scales. a hierarchical bayesian model for the resident brown trout (salmo trutta) life cycle was built to assess the relative influence of local and general determinants of mortality. the model was fitted to an extensive data set collected in 40 river reaches, combining abundance and environmental data (hydraulics, water temperature). density-dependent mortality of juveniles increased at low water temperatures and decreased with shelter availability. high water temperature increased densitydependent mortality in adults. the model could help to predict monthly juvenile and adult mortality under scenarios of global warming and changes in shelter availability due to habitat degradation or restoration."
variation in fine-scale genetic structure and local dispersal patterns between peripheral populations of a south american passerine bird,breeding dispersal; capture-mark-recapture; fine-scale genetic structure; intraspecific variation; natal dispersal; thorn-tailed rayadito,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BOTERO DELGADILLO E;QUIRICI V;POBLETE Y;CUEVAS E;KUHN S;GIRG A;TELTSCHER K;POULIN E;KEMPENAERS B;VASQUEZ RA,"the distribution of suitable habitat influences natal and breeding dispersal at small spatial scales, resulting in strong microgeographic genetic structure. although environmental variation can promote interpopulation differences in dispersal behavior and local spatial patterns, the effects of distinct ecological conditions on within-species variation in dispersal strategies and in fine-scale genetic structure remain poorly understood. we studied local dispersal and fine-scale genetic structure in the thorn-tailed rayadito (aphrastura spinicauda), a south american bird that breeds along a wide latitudinal gradient. we combine capture-mark-recapture data from eight breeding seasons and molecular genetics to compare two peripheral populations with contrasting environments in chile: navarino island, a continuous and low density habitat, and fray jorge national park, a fragmented, densely populated and more stressful environment. natal dispersal showed no sex bias in navarino but was female-biased in the more dense population in fray jorge. in the latter, male movements were restricted, and some birds seemed to skip breeding in their first year, suggesting habitat saturation. breeding dispersal was limited in both populations, with males being more philopatric than females. spatial genetic autocorrelation analyzes using 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci confirmed the observed dispersal patterns: a fine-scale genetic structure was only detectable for males in fray jorge for distances up to 450m. furthermore, two-dimensional autocorrelation analyzes and estimates of genetic relatedness indicated that related males tended to be spatially clustered in this population. our study shows evidence for context-dependent variation in natal dispersal and corresponding local genetic structure in peripheral populations of this bird. it seems likely that the costs of dispersal are higher in the fragmented and higher density environment in fray jorge, particularly for males. the observed differences in microgeographic genetic structure for rayaditos might reflect the genetic consequences of population-specific responses to contrasting environmental pressures near the range limits of its distribution."

chronic plasmodium brasilianum infections in wild peruvian tamarins,NA,PLOS ONE,ERKENSWICK GA;WATSA M;PACHECO MA;ESCALANTE AA;PARKER PG,"there is an increased interest in potential zoonotic malarias. to date, plasmodium malariae that infects humans remains indistinguishable from plasmodium brasilianum, which is widespread among new world primates. distributed throughout tropical central and south america, the callitrichidae are small arboreal primates in which detection of natural plasmodium infection has been extremely rare. most prior screening efforts have been limited to small samples, the use of low-probability detection methods, or both. rarely have screening efforts implemented a longitudinal sampling design. through an annual mark-recapture program of two sympatric callitrichids, the emperor (saguinus imperator) and saddleback (saguinus fuscicollis) tamarins, whole blood samples were screened for plasmodium by microscopy and nested pcr of the cytochrome b gene across four consecutive years (2012-2015). following the first field season, approximately 50% of the samples collected each subsequent year were from recaptured individuals. in particular, out of 245 samples from 129 individuals, 11 samples from 6 individuals were positive for plasmodium, and all but one of these infections was found in s. imperator. importantly, the cytochrome b sequences were 100% identical to former isolates of p. malariae from humans and p. brasilianum from saimiri sp. chronic infections were detected as evidenced by repeated infections (7) from two individuals across the 4-year study period. furthermore, 4 of the 5 infected emperor tamarins were part of a single group spanning the entire study period. overall, the low prevalence reported here is consistent with previous findings. this study identifies two new natural hosts for p. brasilianum and provides evidence in support of chronic infections in wildlife populations. given that callitrichids are often found in mixed-species associations with other primates and can be resilient to human-disturbed environments, they could contribute to the maintenance of p. malariae populations if future work provides entomological and epidemiological evidence indicating human zoonotic infections."

accounting for imperfect detection of groups and individuals when estimating abundance,abundance; aerial surveys; distance sampling; double observer; grouped animals; mark-recapture-distance-sampling; n-mixture models,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CLEMENT MJ;CONVERSE SJ;ROYLE JA,"if animals are independently detected during surveys, many methods exist for estimating animal abundance despite detection probabilities <1. common estimators include double-observer models, distance sampling models and combined double-observer and distance sampling models (known as mark-recapture-distance-sampling models; mrds). when animals reside in groups, however, the assumption of independent detection is violated. in this case, the standard approach is to account for imperfect detection of groups, while assuming that individuals within groups are detected perfectly. however, this assumption is often unsupported. we introduce an abundance estimator for grouped animals when detection of groups is imperfect and group size may be under-counted, but not over-counted. the estimator combines an mrds model with an n-mixture model to account for imperfect detection of individuals. the new mrds-nmix model requires the same data as an mrds model (independent detection histories, an estimate of distance to transect, and an estimate of group size), plus a second estimate of group size provided by the second observer. we extend the model to situations in which detection of individuals within groups declines with distance. we simulated 12 data sets and used bayesian methods to compare the performance of the new mrds-nmix model to an mrds model. abundance estimates generated by the mrds-nmix model exhibited minimal bias and nominal coverage levels. in contrast, mrds abundance estimates were biased low and exhibited poor coverage. many species of conservation interest reside in groups and could benefit from an estimator that better accounts for imperfect detection. furthermore, the ability to relax the assumption of perfect detection of individuals within detected groups may allow surveyors to re-allocate resources toward detection of new groups instead of extensive surveys of known groups. we believe the proposed estimator is feasible because the only additional field data required are a second estimate of group size."

assessment of individual and conspecific reproductive success as determinants of breeding dispersal of female tree swallows: a capture-recapture approach,capture-recapture data; dispersal; multievent model; reproductive success; social information; tree swallow,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,LAGRANGE P;GIMENEZ O;DOLIGEZ B;PRADEL R;GARANT D;PELLETIER F;BELISLE M,"breeding dispersal is a key process of population structure and dynamics and is often triggered by an individual's breeding failure. in both colonial and territorial birds, reproductive success of conspecifics (rsc) can also lead individuals to change breeding sites after a failure on a site. yet, few studies have simultaneously investigated the independent contribution of individual reproductive success (rsi) and of rsc on dispersal decision. here, we develop a modeling framework to disentangle the effects of rsi and rsc on demographic parameters, while accounting for imperfect individual detection and other confounding factors such as age or dispersal behavior in the previous year. using a 10-year capture-recapture dataset composed of 1,595 banded tree swallows, we assessed the effects of nonmanipulated rsi and rsc on female breeding dispersal in this semicolonial passerine. dispersal was strongly driven by rsi, but not by rsc. unsuccessful females were 9.5-2.5 times more likely to disperse than successful ones, depending if they had dispersed or not in the previous year, respectively. unsuccessful females were also three times less likely to be detected than successful ones. contrary to theoretical and empirical studies, rsc did not drive the decision to disperse but influenced the selection of the following breeding site once dispersal had been initiated. because detection of individuals was driven by rsi, which was positively correlated to rsc, assuming a perfect detection as in previous studies may have lead us to conclude that rsc affected dispersal patterns, yet our approach corrected for this bias. overall, our results suggest that the value and use of rsc as public information to guide dispersal decisions are likely dictated by multiple ecological determinants, such as landscape structure and extent, if this cue is indeed used."
"an age-dependent fitness cost of migration? old trans-saharan migrating spoonbills breed later than those staying in europe, and late breeders have lower recruitment",breeding success; carry-over effect; evolution; life history; migration; post-fledging survival; recruitment; timing of breeding; wintering site,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,LOK T;VELDHOEN L;OVERDIJK O;TINBERGEN JM;PIERSMA T,"1. migration is a widespread phenomenon in the animal kingdom. on the basis of the considerable variation that exists between and within species, and even within populations, we may be able to infer the (age- and sex-specific) ecological trade- offs- and constraints moulding migration systems from assessments of fitness associated with migration and wintering in different areas. 2. during three consecutive breeding seasons, we compared the reproductive performance (timing of breeding, breeding success, chick body condition and post-fledging survival) of eurasian spoonbills platalea leucorodia that breed at a single breeding site in the netherlands, but migrate different distances (c. 4,500 vs. 2,000 km, - either or not crossing the sahara) to and from wintering areas in southern europe and west africa. using mark-recapture analysis, we further investigated whether survival until adulthood (recruitment probability) of chicks hatched between 2006 and 2010 was related to their hatch date and body condition. 3. long-distance migrants bred later, particularly the males, and raised chicks of poorer body condition than short-distance migrants. hatch dates strongly advanced with increasing age in short-distance migrants, but hardly advanced in long-distance migrants, causing the difference in timing of breeding between long- and short-distance migrants to be more pronounced among older birds. 4. breeding success and chick body condition decreased over the season, and chicks that fledged late in the season or in poor condition were less likely to survive until adulthood. as a result, long- distance migrants-particularly the males and older birds-likely recruit fewer offspring into the breeding population than short-distance migrants. this inference is important for predicting the population-level consequences of changes in winter habitat suitability throughout the wintering range. 5. assuming that the long- distance migrants-being the birds that occupy the traditional wintering areas-are not the poorer quality birds, and that the observed age-dependent patterns in timing of breeding are driven by within-individual effects and not by selective disappearance, our results suggest that the strategy of long- distance migration, involving the crossing of the sahara to winter in west africa, incurred a cost by reducing reproductive output, albeit a cost paid only later in life."
declining survival of black brant from subarctic and arctic breeding areas,band recovery rates; branta bernicla nigricans; brownie models; joint live and dead mark-recapture; population dynamics; seber reporting rate,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,LEACH AG;WARD DH;SEDINGER JS;LINDBERG MS;BOYD WS;HUPP JW;RITCHIE RJ,"since the mid 1990s, the number of black brant (branta bernicla nigricans; brant) nests on the yukon-kuskokwim delta (ykd), alaska, usa, the historically predominant breeding area of brant, has declined steadily. this has caused researchers and managers to question if arctic breeding populations can compensate for the reduction in brant nests on the ykd. an important component of the assessment of brant population dynamics is having current estimates of first-year and adult survival. we banded brant at 4 locations in arctic alaska and western canada, and at 1 location in the subarctic, the tutakoke river (tr) colony on the ykd, 1990-2015. we used joint live and dead mark-recapture models to estimate first-year and adult (1 yr old) survival of brant. we also used band recovery rates from a brownie model to assess temporal trends in band recovery rates of adult brant. first-year survival of brant hatched at tr declined from approximately 0.60 to <0.20 and, although first-year survival generally was higher for goslings marked in the arctic, their survival declined from approximately 0.70 in the early 1990s to 0.45 in the 2010s. annual survival of adult females decreased from an average of 0.881 (95% ci=0.877-0.885) to 0.822 (95% ci=0.815-0.829) at tr and from 0.851 (95% ci=0.843-0.860) to 0.821 (95% ci=0.805-0.836) in the arctic, from 1990 to 2014. band recovery rates of adults generally were <1.25% until the last several years of study, when they reached 3.5%. although the current harvest rates may be partially additive to natural mortality, we do not believe that harvest is the main influence on the declines in survival. the general decline in survival rates of brant breeding across a large geographic area may be influenced by a reduction in the quality of migration and wintering ground habitats. we suggest an analysis of seasonal survival of brant to test the hypothesis that declining habitat quality on wintering or spring migration areas is reducing survival. our results suggest that the number of breeding pairs at tr will continue to decline and also brings into question the ability of arctic breeding populations to grow at a rate necessary to offset the declines on the ykd. researchers should continue to closely monitor survival and harvest rates of brant, and assess methods currently used to monitor their abundance. (c) 2017 the wildlife society. we found that survival of gosling and adult black brant from subarctic and arctic breeding areas in alaska and western arctic canada has declined since 1990. numbers of brant nests on major colonies, fall age-ratios, and survival rates have all declined; however, estimates of abundance from mid-winter surveys have increased in recent years, indicating further work is needed to resolve conflicting abundance and demographic data for brant."
integrated population models reveal local weather conditions are the key drivers of population dynamics in an aerial insectivore,capture-mark-recapture; climate change; demography; horvitz-thompson estimator; long-distance migrant bird,OECOLOGIA,WEEGMAN MD;ARNOLD TW;DAWSON RD;WINKLER DW;CLARK RG,"changes to weather patterns under a warming climate are complex: while warmer temperatures are expected virtually worldwide, decreased mean precipitation is expected at mid-latitudes. migratory birds depend on broad-scale weather patterns to inform timing of movements, but may be more susceptible to local weather patterns during sedentary periods. we constructed bayesian integrated population models (ipms) to assess whether continental or local weather effects best explained population dynamics in an environmentally sensitive aerial insectivorous bird, the tree swallow (tachycineta bicolor), along a transcontinental gradient from british columbia to saskatchewan to new york, and tested whether population dynamics were synchronous among sites. little consistency existed among sites in the demographic rates most affecting population growth rate or in correlations among rates. juvenile apparent survival at all sites was stable over time and greatest in new york, whereas adult apparent survival was more variable among years and sites, and greatest in british columbia and saskatchewan. fledging success was greatest in saskatchewan. local weather conditions explained significant variation in adult survival in saskatchewan and fledging success in new york, corroborating the hypothesis that local more than continental weather drives the population dynamics of this species and, therefore, demographic synchrony measured at three sites was limited. nonetheless, multi-population ipms can be a powerful tool for identifying correlated population trajectories caused by synchronous demographic rates, and can pinpoint the scale at which environmental drivers are responsible for changes. we caution against applying uniform conservation actions for populations where synchrony does not occur or is not fully understood."

which temporal resolution to consider when investigating the impact of climatic data on population dynamics? the case of the lesser horseshoe bat (rhinolophus hipposideros),rhinolophus hipposideros; temporal resolution; model averaging; climatic variables; population demography,OECOLOGIA,JAN PL;FARCY O;BOIREAU J;LE TEXIER E;BAUDOIN A;LE GOUAR P;PUECHMAILLE SJ;PETIT EJ,"climatic variables are often considered when studying environmental impacts on population dynamics of terrestrial species. however, the temporal resolution considered varies depending on studies, even among studies of the same taxa. most studies interested in climatic impacts on populations tend to average climatic data across timeframes covering life cycle periods of the organism in question or longer, even though most climatic databases provide at least a monthly resolution. we explored the impact of climatic variables on lesser horseshoe bat (rhinolophus hipposideros) demography based on count data collected at 94 maternity colonies from 2000 to 2014 in britanny, france. meteorological data were considered using different time resolutions (month, life cycle period and year) to investigate their adequacy. model averaging was used to detect significant predictors for each temporal resolution. our results show that the finest temporal resolution, e.g. month, was more informative than coarser ones. precipitation predictors were particularly decisive, with a negative impact on colony sizes when rainfall occurred in october, and a positive impact for june precipitations. fecundity was influenced by april weather. this highlights the strong impact of climatic conditions during crucial but short time periods on the population dynamics of bats. we demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate time resolution and suggest that analogous studies should consider fine-scale temporal resolution (e.g. month) to better grasp the relationship between population dynamics and climatic conditions."

annual survival and seasonal hunting mortality of midcontinent snow geese,arctic; harvest; hunting; mark-recapture; mortality; population management; seasonal; snow geese; survival,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,CALVERT AM;ALISAUSKAS RT;WHITE GC,"annual banding programs have allowed the estimation of key demographic parameters for many populations of harvested wildlife, yet they often provide little insight into vital rate variation among seasonally occupied habitats or among regions with differing hunting regulations. for lesser snow geese (chen caerulescens caerulescens) in the midcontinent of north america, rapid growth in abundance and the consequent implementation of special conservation measures present a scenario where seasonal mortality estimates would be highly valuable. we evaluated variation in hunting mortality of adult and young geese among 3 seasons (autumn, winter, and spring) based on annual banding data from breeding colonies north and south of 608nlatitude, and seasonal hunting recoveries from the united states and canada. using band-recovery models and data covering 1999 through 2015, we first estimated annual survival for geese of both age classes and breeding locations, and then subsequently used seasonal hunting recoveries to derive estimates of seasonal hunting mortality and annual non-hunting mortality. simulation models validated the accuracy of this approach. hunting mortality in winter generally exceeded that during spring and autumn, but our estimates suggested that hunting mortality represented a small fraction of annual mortality for adult and young birds. consistent with recent studies, our estimates pointed to a greater harvest effect for the smaller subarctic population breeding near southern hudson bay, canada, than for the large arctic population breeding farther north. although mean kill rates were higher for young than adult geese, natural mortality for young was high and temporally variable, implying that some hunting mortality experienced by young geese during their first year could be compensated by natural causes of death. natural (non-hunting) mortality and annual survival showed greater temporal variation than seasonal kill rates in adults and young geese, highlighting the importance of non-harvest factors (e.g., climate, habitat, population density) to the dynamics of these populations. these novel estimates of seasonal kill rates and non-hunting mortality contribute further support to the notion that internal dynamics of the lesser snow goose midcontinent population, including natural mortality and recruitment, currently influence population trajectory more than ongoing interventions through harvest management.

high and variable mortality of leatherback turtles reveal possible anthropogenic impacts,bycatch; declining population; enso; long-lived; mei; sea turtle,ECOLOGY,TOMILLO PS;ROBINSON NJ;SANZ AGUILAR A;SPOTILA JR;PALADINO FV;TAVECCHIA G,"the number of nesting leatherback turtles (dermochelys coriacea) in the eastern pacific ocean has declined dramatically since the late 1980s. this decline has been attributed to egg poaching and interactions with fisheries. however, it is not clear how much of the decline should also be ascribed to variability in the physical characteristics of the ocean. we used data on individually marked turtles that nest at playa grande, costa rica, to address whether climatic variability affects survival and inter-breeding interval. because some turtles might nest undetected, we used capture-recapture models to model survival probability accounting for a detection failure. in addition, as the probability of reproduction is constrained by past nesting events, we formulated a new parameterization to estimate inter-breeding intervals and contrast hypotheses on the role of climatic covariates on reproductive frequency. average annual survival for the period 1993-2011 was low (0.78) and varied over time ranging from 0.49 to 0.99 with a negative temporal trend mainly due to the high mortality values registered after 2004. survival probability was not associated with the multivariate enso index of the south pacific ocean (mei) but this index explained 24% of the temporal variability in the reproductive frequency. the probability of a turtle to permanently leave after the first encounter was 26%. this high proportion of transients might be associated with a high mortality cost of the first reproduction or with a long-distance nesting dispersal after the first nesting season. although current data do not allow separating these two hypotheses, low encounter rate at other locations and high investment in reproduction, supports the first hypothesis. the low and variable annual survival probability has largely contributed to the decline of this leatherback population. the lack of correlation between survival probability and the most important climatic driver of oceanic processes in the pacific discards a climate-related decline and point to anthropogenic sources of mortality as the main causes responsible for the observed population decline."
adult demography of an isolated population of the threatened butterfly scarce heath coenonympha hero and its conservation implications,flight period; life span; mark-recapture; protandry; sex ratio; temporal fragmentation,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,SIELEZNIEW M;NOWICKI P,"scarce heath coenonympha hero is considered to be one of the most seriously threatened european butterflies, especially declining in western and central europe. it usually occurs in small, discrete colonies forming metapopulation systems, but the exchange of individuals between habitat patches is considered limited. therefore the persistence of the species in fragmented systems is likely to depend largely on the demography of local populations. we investigated a highly isolated population of the species in poland with mark-release-recapture (mrr). the seasonal population size was assessed at 168 adults, with a well balanced sex ratio. the slightly higher capture probability of females that we recorded is quite atypical for butterflies and may be related to the vegetation structure at the site. the flight period was relatively short (22 days), and the adult life span was estimated at 6.59 days, i.e., twice as long when compared with adult longevity in two other threatened coenonympha species. consequently, the temporal fragmentation index (i.e., the ratio of flight period length to adult life span) was calculated at 3.3, which is the lowest value recorded among all congeneric species, suggesting that temporal fragmentation is not a major problem in the investigated population. nevertheless, the population may be at risk of extinction due to its small size and isolation. moreover, the area of c. hero habitat has decreased considerably over the last decade due to afforestation. our findings indicate the need for immediate conservation actions, in particular for the removal of tree seedlings that encroach on the butterfly habitat."
"consequences of severe habitat fragmentation on density, genetics, and spatial capture-recapture analysis of a small bear population",NA,PLOS ONE,MURPHY SM;AUGUSTINE B;ULREY WA;GUTHRIE JM;SCHEICK BK;MCCOWN JW;COX JJ,"loss and fragmentation of natural habitats caused by human land uses have subdivided several formerly contiguous large carnivore populations into multiple small and often isolated subpopulations, which can reduce genetic variation and lead to precipitous population declines. substantial habitat loss and fragmentation from urban development and agriculture expansion relegated the highlands-glades subpopulation (hgs) of florida, usa, black bears (ursus americanus floridanus) to prolonged isolation; increasing human land development is projected to cause >= 50% loss of remaining natural habitats occupied by the hgs in coming decades. we conducted a noninvasive genetic spatial capture-recapture study to quantitatively describe the degree of contemporary habitat fragmentation and investigate the consequences of habitat fragmentation on population density and genetics of the hgs. remaining natural habitats sustaining the hgs were significantly more fragmented and patchier than those supporting florida's largest black bear subpopulation. genetic diversity was low (a(r) = 3.57; h-e = 0.49) and effective population size was small (n-e = 25 bears), both of which remained unchanged over a period spanning one bear generation despite evidence of some immigration. subpopulation density (0.054 bear/km(2)) was among the lowest reported for black bears, was significantly female-biased, and corresponded to a subpopulation size of 98 bears in available habitat. conserving remaining natural habitats in the area occupied by the small, genetically depauperate hgs, possibly through conservation easements and government land acquisition, is likely the most important immediate step to ensuring continued persistence of bears in this area. our study also provides evidence that preferentially placing detectors (e.g., hair traps or cameras) primarily in quality habitat across fragmented landscapes poses a challenge to estimating density-habitat covariate relationships using spatial capture-recapture models. because habitat fragmentation and loss are likely to increase in severity globally, further investigation of the influence of habitat fragmentation and detector placement on estimation of this relationship is warranted."
description of an establishment event by the invasive asian longhorned beetle (anoplophora glabripennis) in a suburban landscape in the northeastern united states,NA,PLOS ONE,HULL SANDERS H;PEPPER E;DAVIS K;TROTTER RT,"the establishment of non-native species is commonly described as occurring in three phases: arrival, establishment, and dispersal. both arrival and dispersal by the asian longhorned beetle (anoplophora glabripennis motschulsky), a xylophagous cerambycid native to china and the korean peninsula, has been documented for multiple locations in both north america and europe, however the transitional phase, establishment, is not well understood for this species due to the need to rapidly remove populations to prevent dispersal and assist eradication, and the evident variation in the behavior of populations. here we describe the dynamics of an establishment event for the asian longhorned beetle in a small, isolated population within the regulated quarantine zone near worcester, massachusetts, usa. these data were collected during an opportunity afforded by logistical limits on the cooperative asian longhorned beetle eradication program administered by state, federal, and local government partners. seventy-one infested red maple (acer rubrum) trees and 456 interspersed un-infested trees were surveyed in an isolated, recently established population within a similar to 0.29 ha stand in a suburban wetland conservation area in which nearly 90% of the trees were host species, and nearly 80% were acer rubrum. tree-ring analyses show that within this establishing population, asian longhorned beetles initially infested one or two a. rubrum, before moving through the stand to infest additional a. rubrum based not on distance or direction, but on tree size, with infestation biased towards trees with larger trunk diameters. survey data from the larger landscape suggest this population may have generated long-distance dispersers (similar to 1400 m), and that these dispersal events occurred before the originally infested host trees were fully exploited by the beetle. the distribution and intensity of damage documented in this population suggest dispersal here may have been spatially more rapid and diffuse than in other documented infestations. dispersal at these larger spatial scales also implies that when beetles move beyond the closed canopy of the stand, the direction of dispersal may be linked to prevailing winds."
disentangling the effects of predation and oceanographic fluctuations in the mortality of two allopatric seabird populations,capture-recapture; climate; multievent; storm petrel; survival,POPULATION ECOLOGY,MATOVIC N;CADIOU B;ORO D;SANZ AGUILAR A,"life-history traits of migratory seabirds are influenced by changing conditions at breeding and wintering grounds. climatic conditions and predation are known to impact populations' survival rates, but few studies examine their effect simultaneously. we used multievent capture-recapture models to assess mortality due to environmental conditions and predation in breeding european storm petrels (hydrobates pelagicus) in two allopatric colonies (mediterranean and atlantic). predatory mortality at the colonies showed annual variation, being around 0.05 in certain years. mortality at sea differed between the two oceanic basins, and was lower in the mediterranean colony [0.11, 95% ci (0.09, 0.14)] when compared to the atlantic colony [0.18, 95% ci (0.15, 0.22)]. the western mediterranean oscillation index (wemoi) explained 57% of the temporal variability in mortality of mediterranean breeders. in comparison, 43% of the temporal variability in mortality of atlantic breeders was explained by the winter st helena index (whix) and el nino-southern oscillation index (wenso). our results suggest that mediterranean breeders remain in this basin for wintering where they may face lower migratory costs and more favourable environmental conditions. in contrast, atlantic breeders' mortality may be due to higher cost of migration, changing upwelling conditions in the benguela current and heavy storms over their migratory route during la nina events. this study underlines the importance of modelling separately different causes of mortality when testing the effects of climatic covariates."

genotype-based estimates of local abundance and effective population size for hector's dolphins,abundance; effective population size; genotype mark-recapture; photo-identification; hector's dolphin; conservation genetics,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,HAMNER RM;CONSTANTINE R;MATTLIN R;WAPLES R;BAKER CS,"conservation and management decisions for wild populations are often based on demographic estimates of abundance ((n) over cap), and less frequently, on genetic estimates of effective population size ((n) over cap (e)). we used genotype based methods to estimate both parameters from the same set of biopsy samples, while also providing information on the geographic closure of a local population of hector's dolphins in cloudy bay, new zealand. the assumption of closure in cloudy bay was supported by the lack of genetic differentiation between the two survey years and the absence of any genetically detectable migrants. using recapture analysis based on genotype identifications, we estimated the abundance of individuals age 1(+) ((n) over cap (1+)) to be 269 (95% cl = 233 - 319, cv = 0.12). this was similar to, but more precise than, (n) over cap = 230 (95% cl = 130 - 407, cv = 0.30) from the more traditional analysis using contemporaneously collected photo-identifications. the (n) over cap (e) of the parental generation was 191 (95% cl = 23 - 362), and the resulting ($) over cap (e)/($) over cap (1+) of 0.71 was in reasonable agreement with species of similar life history characteristics. although (n) over cap (e) was below the recommended threshold (500, recently increased to >= 1000) thought to be necessary to preserve long-term evolutionary potential in perpetuity, genetic connectivity with neighboring populations on a generational time scale is likely to mitigate the negative effects of low local n-e. our work demonstrates the breadth of management-relevant information (e.g., n, n-e, sex ratio, genetic diversity, and connectivity to neighboring populations) that can be obtained from a genotype-based analysis, and how conservation implications can change when demographic and genetic population size are considered along with connectivity."
improving inference for aerial surveys of bears: the importance of assumptions and the cost of unnecessary complexity,apparent bias; availability bias; brown bear; detection probability; distance sampling; informative prior; mark-recapture distance sampling; open n-mixture model; perception bias; precision; ursus arctos,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SCHMIDT JH;WILSON TL;THOMPSON WL;REYNOLDS JH,"obtaining useful estimates of wildlife abundance or density requires thoughtful attention to potential sources of bias and precision, and it is widely understood that addressing incomplete detection is critical to appropriate inference. when the underlying assumptions of sampling approaches are violated, both increased bias and reduced precision of the population estimator may result. bear (ursus spp.) populations can be difficult to sample and are often monitored using mark-recapture distance sampling (mrds) methods, although obtaining adequate sample sizes can be cost prohibitive. with the goal of improving inference, we examined the underlying methodological assumptions and estimator efficiency of three datasets collected under an mrds protocol designed specifically for bears. we analyzed these data using mrds, conventional distance sampling (cds), and open-distance sampling approaches to evaluate the apparent bias-precision tradeoff relative to the assumptions inherent under each approach. we also evaluated the incorporation of informative priors on detection parameters within a bayesian context. we found that the cds estimator had low apparent bias and was more efficient than the more complex mrds estimator. when combined with informative priors on the detection process, precision was increased by > 50% compared to the mrds approach with little apparent bias. in addition, open-distance sampling models revealed a serious violation of the assumption that all bears were available to be sampled. inference is directly related to the underlying assumptions of the survey design and the analytical tools employed. we show that for aerial surveys of bears, avoidance of unnecessary model complexity, use of prior information, and the application of open population models can be used to greatly improve estimator performance and simplify field protocols. although we focused on distance sampling-based aerial surveys for bears, the general concepts we addressed apply to a variety of wildlife survey contexts."
"ski areas affect pacific marten movement, habitat use, and density",density; marten; martes caurina; movement; occupancy; recreation; ski area; spatially explicit capture recapture,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,SLAUSON KM;ZIELINSKI WJ;SCHWARTZ MK,"alpine ski recreation is one of the most popular outdoor winter sports globally but often involves habitat modification and dense human activity, both of which can harm wildlife. we investigated the effects of ski area development and winter recreation activities on movement, occupancy, and density of pacific martens (martes caurina) in the lake tahoe region of california and nevada, usa by comparing 3 ski and 3 control study areas. we systematically surveyed martens using live traps and hair snares during spring-summer and winter seasons from 2009 through 2011 to identify how martens responded to the year-round effects of habitat fragmentation from ski area development and the seasonal effects of winter recreation activities. martens selectively moved between remnant forest patches with the shortest crossing distances across open, non-forested ski runs in both seasons, with the effect more pronounced in females. overall, habitat connectivity was reduced by 41% in ski areas compared to habitat not fragmented by ski runs. during spring-summer, occupancy rates were not different between habitat within or outside of ski operations areas. during winter, however, occupancy was significantly lower inside (52%) ski area boundaries than outside (88%) them. reduced detection probability in ski areas indicated martens also reduced the frequency of use of operations areas in winter. using spatially explicit capture-recapture models, we found that marten density did not differ between ski areas and controls during spring, but during winter female density declined at ski areas by 63% compared to spring-summer and was < 50% of female density compared to controls. this suggests that females seasonally avoid habitat in ski areas by shifting their habitat use to areas outside ski operations boundaries during winter. although male marten density did not differ, the lack of resident males > 3 years old coupled with higher annual turnover rates suggests male densities at ski areas may be reliant on annual male immigration. in winter, martens avoided using habitat in ski operations areas when recreation activity was greatest. winter ski recreation may not be incompatible with marten use of habitat in ski areas, but habitat fragmentation from ski areas affects marten movement and recreation activities affect seasonal habitat occupancy and female density. maintaining functional habitat connectivity, via networks of short ski run crossings that link habitat in and out of ski areas, will be important for maintaining or improving marten use of remnant habitat in developed ski areas.

"identifying key demographic parameters of a small island-associated population of indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins (reunion, indian ocean)",NA,PLOS ONE,DULAU V;ESTRADE V;FAYAN J,"photo-identification surveys of indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins were conducted from 2009 to 2014 off reunion island (55 degrees e33'/21 degrees s07'), in the indian ocean. robust design models were applied to produce the most reliable estimate of population abundance and survival rate, while accounting for temporary emigration from the survey area (west coast). the sampling scheme consisted of a five-month (june-october) sampling period in each year of the study. the overall population size at reunion was estimated to be 72 individuals (se = 6.17, 95% ci = 61-85), based on a random temporary emigration (gamma"") of 0.096 and a proportion of 0.70 (se = 0.03) distinct individuals. the annual survival rate was 0.93 (+/- 0.018 se, 95% ci = 0.886-0.958) and was constant over time and between sexes. models considering gender groups indicated different movement patterns between males and females. males showed null or quasi-null temporary emigration (gamma"" = gamma' < 0.01), while females showed a random temporary emigration (gamma"") of 0.10, suggesting that a small proportion of females was outside the survey area during each primary sampling period. sex-specific temporary migration patterns were consistent with movement and residency patterns observed in other areas. the robust design approach provided an appropriate sampling scheme for deriving island-associated population parameters, while allowing to restrict survey effort both spatially (i.e. west coast only) and temporally (five months per year). although abundance and survival were stable over the six years, the small population size of fewer than 100 individuals suggested that this population is highly vulnerable. priority should be given to reducing any potential impact of human activity on the population and its habitat."
importance of demographic surveys and public lands for the conservation of eastern hellbenders cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis in southeast usa,NA,PLOS ONE,FREAKE MJ;DEPERNO CS,"comparisons of recent and historic population demographic studies of eastern hellbenders cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis have identified significant population declines and extirpations associated with habitat degradation, poor water quality and disease, leading to nomination as a candidate for listing under the endangered species act. however, populations in the southern appalachian region of the range have received less attention despite relatively high levels of watershed protection due to the establishment of federally protected national forest and national park public lands. these watersheds likely represent some of the best remaining available habitat, yet the lack of published studies make assessment of population stability and viability very difficult. our objectives were to (1) conduct a capture-mark-recapture (cmr) demographic study and a point transect survey on the hiwassee river in tennessee which is designated a national scenic river, and is largely contained within the cherokee national forest, (2) quantify the size structure of the population, (3) compare abundance, survival and recruitment with historic and contemporary hellbender populations across the range, (4) assess the importance of this population and the significance of national forest and national park lands in the context of hellbender population conservation in the southeastern united states. we detected all age classes present, with larval hellbenders comprising 21.5% of captures. using a combination of static life table and cmr methods, we determined that survival rates during the first year were low ( similar to 10%), but were high (68-94%) for taggable sized hellbenders. density of hellbenders at the study site was very high (84 taggable sized hellbenders per 100m of river) compared to recent demographic studies conducted in other regions of the range. we detected hellbenders over similar to 28 km of river, with a mean density of 23 taggable sized hellbenders per 100m of river, and a total population estimate of 6440 taggable hellbenders. national forest and national park lands are likely to continue to play a particularly important role in providing suitable habitat for hellbenders in the southern appalachians. in fact, only six of 21 known hellbender locations in tennessee appear to show consistent larval recruitment, all of which are located within or adjacent to national forest or national park land."
natal and breeding philopatry of female steller sea lions in southeastern alaska,NA,PLOS ONE,HASTINGS KK;JEMISON LA;PENDLETON GW;RAUM SURYAN KL;PITCHER KW,"information on drivers of dispersal is critical for wildlife conservation but is rare for long-lived marine mammal species with large geographic ranges. we fit multi-state mark-recapture models to resighting data of 369 known-aged steller sea lion (eumetopias jubatus) females marked as pups on their natal rookeries in southeastern alaska from 1994-2005 and monitored from 2001-15. we estimated probabilities of females being first observed parous at their natal site (natal philopatry), and of not moving breeding sites among years (breeding philopatry) at large (> 400 km, all five rookeries in southeastern alaska) and small (< 4 km, all islands within the largest rookery, forrester island complex, f) spatial scales. at the rookery scale, natal philopatry was moderately high (0.776-0.859) for most rookeries and breeding philopatry was nearly 1, with < 3% of females switching breeding rookeries between years. at more populous islands at f, natal philopatry was 0.500-0.684 versus 0.295-0.437 at less populous islands, and breeding philopatry was 0.919-0.926 versus 0.604-0.858. at both spatial scales, the probability of pupping at a non-natal site increased with population size of, and declined with distance from, the destination site. natal philopatry of < 1 would increase gene flow, improve population resilience, and promote population recovery after decline in a heterogeneous environment. very high breeding philopatry suggests that familiarity with neighboring females and knowledge of the breeding site (the topography of pupping sites and nearby foraging locations) may be a critical component to reproductive strategies of sea lions."
"low population viability in small endangered orchid populations: genetic variation, seedling recruitment and stochasticity",epipactis atrorubens; genetic diversity; mark-recapture model; population growth rate; population viability; transition matrix,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,HENS H;PAKANEN VM;JAKALANIEMI A;TUOMI J;KVIST L,"there are only few studies that use both demographic and genetic data to assess population viability of plant species. we combined genetic and demographic data from 11 endangered perennial orchid populations of varying size in order to reveal determinants of viability. small populations had substantially lower viability compared to large populations. seedling recruitment rates were remarkably lower in small populations; this was not due to pollination limitation or inbreeding depression because the fruit set and heterozygosity were not correlated with population size, suggesting that there may be differences in successful germination. low recruitment resulted in significantly lower predicted population growth rates in small populations. the impact of stochasticity on viability varied among populations and stochastic simulations indicated that only one large population was viable, whereas all the other large populations were predicted to go extinct within decades. while there was a positive correlation between the deterministic population growth rate and allelic richness, we did not find any other correlations between genetic variation and fitness or population size. the study populations are likely remnant populations of a once large meta-population that decreased in size due to unfavourable environmental conditions. management should focus on the maintenance of large population size, which is needed to avoid negative consequences of stochasticity and to enhance seedling recruitment rates."
long-term monitoring of phengaris (lepidoptera: lycaenidae) butterflies in the pa (tm) elou surroundings (czech republic): is the waterway construction a serious threat?,extinction risk; phengaris teleius; phengaris nausithous; population size; natura 2000; threat assessment; waterway construction,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,VRABEC V;KULMA M;BUBOVA T;NOWICKI P,"the monitoring of sympatrically occurring phengaris teleius and p. nausithous metapopulations in the surroundings of pa (tm) elou, czech republic, was launched over a decade ago in connection with the planned waterway construction on the elbe river. the mark-recapture surveys were initially restricted to 10 habitat patches on the right river bank, but in 2010 three new patches were discovered on the opposite bank. we use the monitoring results for 2011-2015 to assess how the discovery of additional populations alters the impact evaluation of the prospective construction. the overall abundance of p. teleius in the recently discovered populations was about twice as high as on the right bank (ca. 2,800 vs. 1,400 adults on average), while the numbers of p. nausithous on both banks proved to be balanced (at ca. 600 adults on average). furthermore, we confirmed a substantial exchange of butterflies between population representing both banks, which indicates a well-integrated metapopulation in both species. since the waterway would partly destroy the two largest populations on the right bank, the potential loss due to its construction is estimated at 40.1-64.3% p. teleius individuals and 20.2-47.4% p. nausithous individuals occurring there. nevertheless, concerning the entire metapopulation, the predicted decline is considerably smaller, reaching 13.9-25.7% in p. teleius and 8.5-20.0% in p. nausithous. consequently, a long-term survival of the species is likely even in the case of the waterway construction, as long as appropriate management is applied on the unaffected habitat patches."

food availability as a major driver in the evolution of life-history strategies of sibling species,age at first reproduction; bats; demography; life-history trade-off; multistate capture-recapture model; survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ARLETTAZ R;CHRISTE P;SCHAUB M,"life-history theory predicts trade-offs between reproductive and survival traits such that different strategies or environmental constraints may yield comparable lifetime reproductive success among conspecifics. food availability is one of the most important environmental factors shaping developmental processes. it notably affects key life-history components such as reproduction and survival prospect. we investigated whether food resource availability could also operate as an ultimate driver of life-history strategy variation between species. during 13 years, we marked and recaptured young and adult sibling mouse-eared bats (myotis myotis and myotis blythii) at sympatric colonial sites. we tested whether distinct, species-specific trophic niches and food availability patterns may drive interspecific differences in key life-history components such as age at first reproduction and survival. we took advantage of a quasi-experimental setting in which prey availability for the two species varies between years (pulse vs. nonpulse resource years), modeling mark-recapture data for demographic comparisons. prey availability dictated both adult survival and age at first reproduction. the bat species facing a more abundant and predictable food supply early in the season started its reproductive life earlier and showed a lower adult survival probability than the species subjected to more limited and less predictable food supply, while lifetime reproductive success was comparable in both species. the observed life-history trade-off indicates that temporal patterns in food availability can drive evolutionary divergence in life-history strategies among sympatric sibling species."
surviving at high elevations: an inter- and intra-specific analysis in a mountain bird community,adult survival; elevation; inter-specific variation; capture-recapture analyses; passerines,OECOLOGIA,BASTIANELLI G;TAVECCHIA G;MELENDEZ L;SEOANE J;OBESO JR;LAIOLO P,"elevation represents an important selection agent on self-maintenance traits and correlated life histories in birds, but no study has analysed whether life-history variation along this environmental cline is consistent among and within species. in a sympatric community of passerines, we analysed how the average adult survival of 25 open-habitat species varied with their elevational distribution and how adult survival varied with elevation at the intra-specific level. for such purpose, we estimated intra-specific variation in adult survival in two mountainous species, the water pipit (anthus spinoletta) and the northern wheatear (oenanthe oenanthe) in nw spain, by means of capture-recapture analyses. at the inter-specific level, high-elevation species showed higher survival values than low elevation ones, likely because a greater allocation to self-maintenance permits species to persist in alpine environments. at the intra-specific level, the magnitude of survival variation was lower by far. nevertheless, water pipit survival slightly decreased at high elevations, while the proportion of transient birds increased. in contrast, no such relationships were found in the northern wheatear. intra-specific analyses suggest that living at high elevation may be costly, such as for the water pipit in our case study. therefore, it seems that a species can persist with viable populations in uplands, where extrinsic mortality is high, by increasing the investment in self-maintenance and prospecting behaviours."
"estimating tadpole-detection rates using visual field surveys: effects of survey time, tadpole species and tadpole density",amphibian; babina subaspera; detection probability; elastomer; mark-recapture; occupancy model; odorrana splendida; stream,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,IWAI N,"context. when understanding species occupancy, estimation of detection probability for the target species is often required, provided by repeated surveys. however, if the actual detection probability of the species is determined experimentally, such estimates are not required, and the reliability of the occupancy data obtained by a particular survey effort can be determined. aims. the aim of this study was to determine the detection rate of tadpoles using visual field surveys, as well as to explore the effects of survey time, species and tadpole density on the tadpole-detection rate. the suitability of visual surveys for detecting tadpole occupancy was also assessed. methods. batch-identified tadpoles were released into several pools and repeatedly counted over successive days to calculate detection rates using visual observation. in experiment 1, the effects of tag colour, survey time (morning vs night) and species on the detection rates of two species of tadpoles (babina subaspera and odorrana splendida) were examined. in experiment 2, the effects of tadpole density on o. splendida were examined. key results. detection rates varied by survey time, species and tadpole density; mean rates ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 for b. subaspera and 0.4 to 0.8 for o. splendida, with higher rates at night. there was a negative relationship between detection rate and tadpole density. based on these detection rates, it was calculated that single visual surveys of o. splendida tadpoles can achieve detection probabilities near 1.0 when more than four individuals occur in a patch. conclusions. variations in detection probability should be considered in field surveys. if the factors that cause variations in detection rates are controlled, visual surveys of tadpoles should, at least in some species, provide detection probabilities near 1.0. implications. when repeated surveys to estimate species occupancy are not practicable, determination of the actual detection probability of the target species using real detection rates provides a robust alternative approach."
population dynamics of the critically endangered toad atelopus cruciger and the fungal disease chytridiomycosis,NA,PLOS ONE,LAMPO M;SENARIS C;GARCIA CZ,"harlequin toads (atelopus) are among the most severely impacted amphibians by the emergence of chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease caused by the pathogen batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd). many species disappeared while others suffered drastic contractions of their geographic distribution to lower altitudes. a diminished virulence of bd in warm habitats was proposed to explain the survival of lowland populations of harlequin toads (i.e. thermal refuge hypothesis). to understand the mechanisms that allow some populations to reach an endemic equilibrium with this pathogen, we estimated demographic and epidemiological parameters at one remnant population of atelopus cruciger in venezuela using mark-recapture data from 2007-2013. we demonstrated that bd is highly virulent for a. cruciger, increasing the odds of dying of infected adults four times in relation to uninfected ones and reducing the life expectancy of reproductive toads to a few weeks. despite an estimated annual loss of 18% of the reproductive population due to bd-induced mortality, this population has persisted in an endemic equilibrium for the last decade through the large recruitment of healthy adults every year. given the high vulnerability of harlequin toads to bd in lowland populations, thermal refuges need to be redefined as habitats of reduced transmission rather than attenuated virulence."
examining disease prevalence for species of conservation concern using non-invasive spatial capture-recapture techniques,disease prevalence; giraffa camelopardalis; giraffe skin disease; non-invasive surveys; population modelling; ruaha national park; spatial capture-recapture; species of conservation concern; tanzania,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MUNEZA AB;LINDEN DW;MONTGOMERY RA;DICKMAN AJ;ROLOFF GJ;MACDONALD DW;FENNESSY JT,"1. non-invasive techniques have long been used to estimate wildlife population abundance and density. however, recent technological breakthroughs have facilitated non-invasive estimation of the proportion of animal populations with certain diseases. giraffes giraffa camelopardalis are increasingly becoming recognized as a species of conservation concern with decreasing population trajectories across their range in africa. 2. diseases may be an important component impacting giraffe population declines, and the emerging 'giraffe skin disease' (gsd), characterized by the appearance of wrinkled skin and alopecic lesions on the limbs, neck and chest of infected giraffe, may hinder movement causing increased susceptibility to predation. 3. we examined the prevalence of gsd in tanzania's ruaha national park over a 4-month period in 2015, using photographic capture-recapture surveys via road-based transects. we divided the study area into five circuitous survey units, each approximately 100 km in length ((x) over bar = 99.22 km, sd = 3.72), and surveyed for giraffes for 4 months. from these surveys, we developed a data base of spatially explicit giraffe photographs. 4. we processed these photographs for individual identification and fitted spatial capture-recapture models to predict the spatial configuration of giraffe abundance and gsd prevalence within the study area. 5. our results indicated that > 86% of the giraffe population showed signs of gsd and that the disease was more prevalent in the northern and north-eastern portion of ruaha national park. 6. synthesis and applications. our research shows that data from non-invasive surveys can be used in spatial capture-recapture (scr) models to estimate the proportion of a population affected by a visible disease. researchers and conservationists can use scr models to better examine the variation in parameters associated with these populations such as sex, age class, movement, and encounter rate, which may be linked to the prevalence of the disease, while incorporating broad spatial and temporal dimensions of the population in such areas. we discuss the implications of this research for conservation of threatened species with an emphasis on disease ecology and vulnerability to predations, and more broadly, for wildlife conservation."
counting chirps: acoustic monitoring of cryptic frogs,acoustic array; acoustic spatially explicit capture-recapture; anurans; call density; non-invasive sampling; population monitoring; sensor networks; signal strength; time of arrival; triangulation,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MEASEY GJ;STEVENSON BC;SCOTT T;ALTWEGG R;BORCHERS DL,"1. global amphibian declines have resulted in a vital need for monitoring programmes that follow population trends. monitoring using advertisement calls is ideal as choruses are undisturbed during data collection. however, methods currently employed by managers frequently rely on trained observers and/or do not provide density data on which to base trends. 2. this study explores the utility of monitoring using acoustic spatially explicit capture-recapture (ascr) with time of arrival (toa) and signal strength (ss) as a quantitative monitoring technique to measure call density of a threatened but visually cryptic anuran, the cape peninsula moss frog arthroleptella lightfooti. 3. the relationships between temporal and climatic variables (date, rainfall, temperature) and a. lightfooti call density at three study sites on the cape peninsula, south africa, were examined. acoustic data, collected from an array of six microphones over 4 months during the winter breeding season, provided a time series of call density estimates. 4. model selection indicated that call density was primarily associated with seasonality fitted as a quadratic function. call density peaked mid-breeding season. at the main study site, the lowest recorded mean call density (0.160 calls m(-2) min(-1)) occurred in may and reached its peak mid-july (1.259 calls m(-2) min(-1)). the sites differed in call density, but also the effective sampling area. 5. synthesis and applications. the monitoring technique, acoustic spatially explicit capture-recapture (ascr), quantitatively estimates call density of calling animals without disturbing them or their environment. in addition, time of arrival (toa) and signal strength (ss) data significantly add to the accuracy of call localization, which in turn increases precision of call density estimates without the need for specialist field staff. this technique appears ideally suited to aid the monitoring of visually cryptic, acoustically active species."

adult mortality in a low-density tree population using high-resolution remote sensing,bayesian state-space; capture-recapture; hierarchical bayes; population dynamics; remote sensing,ECOLOGY,KELLNER JR;HUBBELL SP,"we developed a statistical framework to quantify mortality rates in canopy trees observed using time series from high-resolution remote sensing. by timing the acquisition of remote sensing data with synchronous annual flowering in the canopy tree species handroanthus guayacan, we made 2,596 unique detections of 1,006 individual adult trees within 18,883 observation attempts on barro colorado island, panama (bci) during an 11-yr period. there were 1,057 observation attempts that resulted in missing data due to cloud cover or incomplete spatial coverage. using the fraction of 123 individuals from an independent field sample that were detected by satellite data (109 individuals, 88.6%), we estimate that the adult population for this species on bci was 1,135 individuals. we used a bayesian state-space model that explicitly accounted for the probability of tree detection and missing observations to compute an annual adult mortality rate of 0.2%.yr(-1) (se = 0.1, 95% ci = 0.06-0.45). an independent estimate of the adult mortality rate from 260 field-checked trees closely matched the landscape-scale estimate (0.33%.yr(-1), se = 0.16, 95% ci = 0.12-0.74). our proof-of-concept study shows that one can remotely estimate adult mortality rates for canopy tree species precisely in the presence of variable detection and missing observations."

conservation implications of source-sink dynamics within populations of endangered maculinea butterflies,mark-recapture; population survey; resource availability; source-sink system; species conservation,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,TIMUS N;CZEKES Z;RAKOSY L;NOWICKI P,"conservation programmes are often based on snapshot information on animal abundance. however, land fragments with high numbers of individuals do not necessarily represent their natal areas, which are crucial for species persistence. a classic example of the above principle are source-sink systems, in which excess individuals emigrate from source areas during their lifetime and gather in sink areas. we demonstrated the existence of source-sink dynamics in two species of endangered maculinea (=phengaris) butterflies. sympatrically occurring m. nausithous and m. teleius were investigated with mark-recapture sampling during the entire flight period. in the first half of the season a great majority of butterflies were captured within the relatively small central part of the site, while later their numbers became similar between the site centre and its peripheries. the analysis of movements indicated that most individuals captured in the peripheral zone eclosed in the central zone. moreover, the timing of the sharp increase in movements from the site centre to its peripheries corresponded well with the period when the number of eggs laid in the former area reached carrying capacity, defined by the number of the sanguisorba officinalis foodplant flowerheads available for oviposition. within the peripheral zone the foodplant availability greatly exceeded the egg load, but in contrast the abundance of host ants (i.e. the other essential resource) was low, which presumably results in low maculinea larval survival there. our findings imply that setting conservation priorities over different land fragments should take into account dispersion of individuals among them."

a hierarchical model for estimating the spatial distribution and abundance of animals detected by continuous-time recorders,NA,PLOS ONE,DORAZIO RM;KARANTH KU,"motivation several spatial capture-recapture (scr) models have been developed to estimate animal abundance by analyzing the detections of individuals in a spatial array of traps. most of these models do not use the actual dates and times of detection, even though this information is readily available when using continuous-time recorders, such as microphones or motion-activated cameras. instead most scr models either partition the period of trap operation into a set of subjectively chosen discrete intervals and ignore multiple detections of the same individual within each interval, or they simply use the frequency of detections during the period of trap operation and ignore the observed times of detection. both practices make inefficient use of potentially important information in the data. model and data analysis we developed a hierarchical scr model to estimate the spatial distribution and abundance of animals detected with continuous-time recorders. our model includes two kinds of point processes: a spatial process to specify the distribution of latent activity centers of individuals within the region of sampling and a temporal process to specify temporal patterns in the detections of individuals. we illustrated this scr model by analyzing spatial and temporal patterns evident in the camera-trap detections of tigers living in and around the nagarahole tiger reserve in india. we also conducted a simulation study to examine the performance of our model when analyzing data sets of greater complexity than the tiger data. benefits our approach provides three important benefits: first, it exploits all of the information in scr data obtained using continuous-time recorders. second, it is sufficiently versatile to allow the effects of both space use and behavior of animals to be specified as functions of covariates that vary over space and time. third, it allows both the spatial distribution and abundance of individuals to be estimated, effectively providing a species distribution model, even in cases where spatial covariates of abundance are unknown or unavailable. we illustrated these benefits in the analysis of our data, which allowed us to quantify differences between nocturnal and diurnal activities of tigers and to estimate their spatial distribution and abundance across the study area. our continuous-time scr model allows an analyst to specify many of the ecological processes thought to be involved in the distribution, movement, and behavior of animals detected in a spatial trapping array of continuous-time recorders. we plan to extend this model to estimate the population dynamics of animals detected during multiple years of scr surveys."

noninvasive genetic spatial capture-recapture for estimating deer population abundance,abundance; california; density; habitat modeling; mule deer; noninvasive; odocoileus hemionus; spatially explicit capture-recapture,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BRAZEAL JL;WEIST T;SACKS BN,"informed management of wildlife populations requires the accurate estimation of abundance, sex ratio, and other population parameters. for deer (odocoileus spp.), the use of closed-population, capture-recapture (cr) methods, in conjunction with noninvasive dna sampling, has become increasingly practical, but, up to now, these methods have been used in a non-spatial modeling framework, which has limited their utility for population-level inferences. in particular, extrapolation of plot-level cr abundance estimates to the population required the use of multipliers of unknown reliability and potential bias. spatially explicit capture-recapture (scr) models provide an integrated framework for directly estimating density as a function of spatial and habitat variables at landscape scales. we used fecal dna samples in conjunction with scr to estimate density, sex ratio, and habitat correlates to density for a mule deer (o. hemionus) population across a large (approximate to 500km(2)) area in the central sierra nevada range, california, usa during 2013 and 2014. we surveyed 24 random transects within 4 30-km(2) sites representative of the study area. based on 411 samples genotyped at a sex marker and 8-10 microsatellite loci, the sex-ratio for the study area was 62 (95% ci=41-93) males/100 females in 2013 and 65 (95% ci=45-94) males/100 females in 2014. using scr, we estimated density at 5.0 (95% ci=2.3-7.8) deer/km(2) in 2013 and 5.1 (95% ci=3.1-7.2) deer/km(2) in 2014. in comparison, non-spatial cr analysis produced density estimates on average 60% higher, likely reflecting bias resulting from use of the commonly employed mean maximum recapture distance (mmrd) to estimate effective sampling area. the scr models indicated that density was effectively homogeneous throughout the study area, with no strong relationship to habitat correlates. altogether, these results demonstrate the utility of noninvasive fecal dna methods in a scr framework for estimation of abundance and density in deer populations at landscape scales. (c) 2017 the wildlife society through an application in a mule deer population in california, usa, we demonstrated the utility of spatially explicit capture recapture (scr) analysis of fecal dna samples to obtain precise estimates of abundance and density of mule deer at the population level. this method can provide a particularly useful way for wildlife managers to monitor deer abundance in forested areas where visibility limits feasibility of aerial surveys. the scr models additionally allow for integration of environmental variables as predictors of density and estimation of survival and recruitment in longer term studies."

effects of environmental covariates and density on the catchability of fish populations and interpretation of catch per unit effort trends,capture probability; catchability; stock assessment; mark-recapture; fishery-independent surveys,FISHERIES RESEARCH,KORMAN J;YARD MD,"quantifying temporal and spatial trends in abundance or relative abundance is required to evaluate effects of harvest and changes in habitat for exploited and endangered fish populations. in many cases, the proportion of the population or stock that is captured (catchability or capture probability) is unknown but is often assumed to be constant over space and time. we used data from a large-scale mark-recapture study to evaluate the extent of spatial and temporal variation, and the effects of fish density, fish size, and environmental covariates, on the capture probability of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in the colorado river, az. estimates of capture probability for boat electrofishing varied 5-fold across five reaches, 2.8-fold across the range of fish densities that were encountered, 2.1-fold over 19 trips, and 1.6-fold over five fish size classes. shoreline angle and turbidity were the best covariates explaining variation in capture probability across reaches and trips. patterns in capture probability were driven by changes in gear efficiency and spatial aggregation, but the latter was more important. failure to account for effects of fish density on capture probability when translating a historical catch per unit effort time series into a time series of abundance, led to 2.5-fold underestimation of the maximum extent of variation in abundance over the period of record, and resulted in unreliable estimates of relative change in critical years. catch per unit effort surveys have utility for monitoring long-term trends in relative abundance, but are too imprecise and potentially biased to evaluate population response to habitat changes or to modest changes in fishing effort.

the influence of climatic variation and density on the survival of an insular passerine zosterops lateralis,NA,PLOS ONE,SANDVIG EM;COULSON T;KIKKAWA J;CLEGG SM,"understanding the influence of environmental factors on population dynamics is fundamental to many areas in biology. survival is a key factor of population biology, as it is thought to be the predominant driver of growth in long-lived passerines, which can be influenced by both biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. we used mark-recapture methods and generalized linear mixed models to test the influence of density and climatic variation, measured at a regional and local scale (southern oscillation index [soi] and rainfall, respectively), on seasonal variation in survival rates of an insular population of silvereyes (zosterops lateralis chlorocephalus), during a 15-year study period, off the east coast of australia. we found overall high survival rates for adults and juveniles (81% and 59%, respectively). local scale climate (i.e. rainfall) and density were the principal environmental factors influencing their survival, both with a negative relationship. a significant interactive effect of density and rainfall influenced survival as they both increased. however, survival remained low when density was at it highest, independent of the amount of rainfall. nestling survival was negatively influenced by rainfall and density, positively by soi, and chicks that hatched later in the breeding season had higher survival rates. the regional scale climate variable (i.e. soi) did not explain survival rates as strongly as rainfall in any age class. our results contribute to the understanding of insular avian population dynamics and the differential effects of environmental factors across age classes. climatic predictions expect el nino events to increase, meaning dryer conditions in eastern australia, potentially increasing silvereye survival across age classes. however, the long-term effect of lower rainfall on food availability is unknown; consequently, the outcome of lower rainfall on silvereye survival rates is uncertain."
quantifying dispersal of a non-aggressive saprophytic bark beetle,NA,PLOS ONE,MEURISSE N;PAWSON S,"long distance dispersal to locate suitable breeding sites is recognized as a key trait influencing the population dynamics and distribution of bark beetles and other saprophytic insects. while dispersal behavior has been studied for a range of aggressive 'tree killing' bark beetles, few have considered the dispersal behaviour of non-aggressive saprophytic bark beetles that utilize kairomones (host volatiles). we present the results of a mark-recapture experiment that examined adult dispersal patterns of the saprophytic bark beetle hylurgus ligniperda. releases took place in summer and autumn 2014, in a clearcut pine forest in the central north island, new zealand. both flight-experienced and flight-naive adults were marked and released in the center of a circular trap grid that extended to 960 m with 170 or 200 panel traps baited with a kairomone blend of alpha-pinene and ethanol. of the 18,464 released h. ligniperda, 9,209 (49.9%) of the beetles flew, and 96 (1.04%) of the beetles that flew were recaptured. individuals were recaptured at all distances. the recapture of flightexperienced beetles declined with dispersal distance, and a diffusion model showed heterogeneous dispersal tendencies within the population. our best model estimated that 46% of flight-experienced beetles disperse > 1 km, and 1.6% > 5 km. conversely, no declining pattern was shown in the recapture of flight-naive beetles, suggesting that emerging h. ligniperda may require a period of flight to initiate chemotropic orientation behavior and subsequent attraction to traps. we discuss the implications of these findings for the management of phytosanitary risks. for instance, combining landscape knowledge of source populations with dispersal processes facilitates estimation of pest pressure at economically sensitive areas such as harvest and timber storage sites. quantitative dispersal estimates also inform pest risk assessments by predicting spread rates for h. ligniperda that has proven establishment capabilities in other countries."

role of breeding and natal movements in lifetime dispersal of a forest-dwelling rodent,bequeathal; gene flow; movement ecology; population spread,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SELONEN V;WISTBACKA R,"the lifetime movements of an individual determine the gene flow and invasion potential of the species. however, sex dependence of dispersal and selective pressures driving dispersal have gained much more attention than dispersal at different life and age stages. natal dispersal is more common than dispersal between breeding attempts, but breeding dispersal may be promoted by resource availability and competition. here, we utilize mark-recapture data on the nest-box population of siberian flying squirrels to analyze lifetime dispersal patterns. natal dispersal means the distance between the natal nest and the nest used the following year, whereas breeding movements refer to the nest site changes between breeding attempts. the movement distances observed here were comparable to distances reported earlier from radio-telemetry studies. breeding movements did not contribute to lifetime dispersal distance and were not related to variation in food abundance or habitat patch size. breeding movements of males were negatively, albeit not strongly, related to male population size. in females, breeding movement activity was low and was not related to previous breeding success or to competition between females for territories. natal philopatry was linked to apparent death of a mother; that is, we did not find evidence for mothers bequeathing territories for offspring, like observed in some other rodent species. our results give an example of a species in which breeding movements are not driven by environmental variability or nest site quality. different evolutionary forces often operate in natal and breeding movements, and our study supports the view that juveniles are responsible for redistributing individuals within and between populations. this emphasizes the importance of knowledge on natal dispersal, if we want to understand consequences of movement ecology of the species at the population level."

"effects of social organization, trap arrangement and density, sampling scale, and population density on bias in population size estimation using some common mark-recapture estimators",NA,PLOS ONE,GUPTA M;JOSHI A;VIDYA TNC,"mark-recapture estimators are commonly used for population size estimation, and typically yield unbiased estimates for most solitary species with low to moderate home range sizes. however, these methods assume independence of captures among individuals, an assumption that is clearly violated in social species that show fission-fusion dynamics, such as the asian elephant. in the specific case of asian elephants, doubts have been raised about the accuracy of population size estimates. more importantly, the potential problem for the use of mark-recapture methods posed by social organization in general has not been systematically addressed. we developed an individual-based simulation framework to systematically examine the potential effects of type of social organization, as well as other factors such as trap density and arrangement, spatial scale of sampling, and population density, on bias in population sizes estimated by popan, robust design, and robust design with detection heterogeneity. in the present study, we ran simulations with biological, demographic and ecological parameters relevant to asian elephant populations, but the simulation framework is easily extended to address questions relevant to other social species. we collected capture history data from the simulations, and used those data to test for bias in population size estimation. social organization significantly affected bias in most analyses, but the effect sizes were variable, depending on other factors. social organization tended to introduce large bias when trap arrangement was uniform and sampling effort was low. popan clearly outperformed the two robust design models we tested, yielding close to zero bias if traps were arranged at random in the study area, and when population density and trap density were not too low. social organization did not have a major effect on bias for these parameter combinations at which popan gave more or less unbiased population size estimates. therefore, the effect of social organization on bias in population estimation could be removed by using popan with specific parameter combinations, to obtain population size estimates in a social species."

immigration ensures population survival in the siberian flying squirrel,dispersal; gliding mammal; integrated population model; mark-recapture; population growth,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BROMMER JE;WISTBACKA R;SELONEN V,"linking dispersal to population growth remains a challenging task and is a major knowledge gap, for example, for conservation management. we studied relative roles of different demographic rates behind population growth in siberian flying squirrels in two nest-box breeding populations in western finland. adults and offspring were captured and individually identifiable. we constructed an integrated population model, which estimated all relevant annual demographic rates (birth, local [apparent] survival, and immigration) as well as population growth rates. one population (studied 2002-2014) fluctuated around a steady-state equilibrium, whereas the other (studied 1995-2014) showed a numerical decline. immigration was the demographic rate which showed clear correlations to annual population growth rates in both populations. population growth rate was density dependent in both populations. none of the demographic rates nor the population growth rate correlated across the two study populations, despite their proximity suggesting that factors regulating the dynamics are determined locally. we conclude that flying squirrels may persist in a network of uncoupled subpopulations, where movement between subpopulations is of critical importance. our study supports the view that dispersal has the key role in population survival of a small forest rodent."

when perception reflects reality: non-native grass invasion alters small mammal risk landscapes and survival,habitat homogenization; habitat selection; human-induced habitat change; invasion biology; invasive species; optimal foraging; predation risk,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CERADINI JP;CHALFOUN AD,"modification of habitat structure due to invasive plants can alter the risk landscape for wildlife by, for example, changing the quality or availability of refuge habitat. whether perceived risk corresponds with actual fitness outcomes, however, remains an important open question. we simultaneously measured how habitat changes due to a common invasive grass (cheatgrass, bromus tectorum) affected the perceived risk, habitat selection, and apparent survival of a small mammal, enabling us to assess how well perceived risk influenced important behaviors and reflected actual risk. we measured perceived risk by nocturnal rodents using a giving-up density foraging experiment with paired shrub (safe) and open (risky) foraging trays in cheatgrass and native habitats. we also evaluated microhabitat selection across a cheatgrass gradient as an additional assay of perceived risk and behavioral responses for deer mice (peromyscus maniculatus) at two spatial scales of habitat availability. finally, we used mark-recapture analysis to quantify deer mouse apparent survival across a cheatgrass gradient while accounting for detection probability and other habitat features. in the foraging experiment, shrubs were more important as protective cover in cheatgrass-dominated habitats, suggesting that cheatgrass increased perceived predation risk. additionally, deer mice avoided cheatgrass and selected shrubs, and marginally avoided native grass, at two spatial scales. deer mouse apparent survival varied with a cheatgrass-shrub interaction, corresponding with our foraging experiment results, and providing a rare example of a native plant mediating the effects of an invasive plant on wildlife. by synthesizing the results of three individual lines of evidence (foraging behavior, habitat selection, and apparent survival), we provide a rare example of linkage between behavioral responses of animals indicative of perceived predation risk and actual fitness outcomes. moreover, our results suggest that exotic grass invasions can influence wildlife populations by altering risk landscapes and survival."

climatic conditions produce contrasting influences on demographic traits in a long-distance arctic migrant,annual routine; canadian arctic; capture-mark-recapture; climate change; population demography,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,CLEASBY IR;BODEY TW;VIGFUSDOTTIR F;MCDONALD JL;MCELWAINE G;MACKIE K;COLHOUN K;BEARHOP S,"1. the manner in which patterns of variation and interactions among demographic rates contribute to population growth rate (lambda) is key to understanding how animal populations will respond to changing climatic conditions. 2. migratory species are likely to be particularly sensitive to climatic conditions as they experience a range of different environments throughout their annual cycle. however, few studies have provided fully integrated demographic analyses of migratory populations in response to changing climatic conditions. 3. here, we employed integrated population models to demonstrate that the environmental conditions experienced during a short but critical period play a central role in the demography of a long-distance migrant, the light-bellied brent goose (branta bernicla hrota). 4. female survival was positively associated with june north atlantic oscillation (nao) values, whereas male survival was not. in contrast, breeding productivity was negatively associated with june nao, suggesting a trade-off between female survival and reproductive success. both adult female and adult male survival showed low temporal variation, whereas there was high temporal variation in recruitment and breeding productivity. in addition, while annual population growth was positively correlated with annual breeding productivity, a sensitivity analysis revealed that population growth was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. 5. our results demonstrate that the environmental conditions experienced during a relatively short-time window at the start of the breeding season play a critical role in shaping the demography of a long-distant arctic migrant. crucially, different demographic rates responded in opposing directions to climatic variation, emphasising the need for integrated analysis of multiple demographic traits when understanding population dynamics."
hard choices in assessing survival past dams - a comparison of single- and paired-release strategies,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,ZYDLEWSKI J;STICH D;SIGOURNEY D,"mark-recapture models are widely used to estimate survival of salmon smolts migrating past dams. paired releases have been used to improve estimate accuracy by removing components of mortality not attributable to the dam. this method is accompanied by reduced precision because (i) sample size is reduced relative to a single, large release; and (ii) variance calculations inflate error. we modeled an idealized system with a single dam to assess trade-offs between accuracy and precision and compared methods using root mean squared error (rmse). simulations were run under predefined conditions (dam mortality, background mortality, detection probability, and sample size) to determine scenarios when the paired release was preferable to a single release. we demonstrate that a paired-release design provides a theoretical advantage over a single-release design only at large sample sizes and high probabilities of detection. at release numbers typical of many survival studies, paired release can result in overestimation of dam survival. failures to meet model assumptions of a paired release may result in further overestimation of dam-related survival. under most conditions, a single-release strategy was preferable."

(c) 2016 the wildlife society. we evaluated the performance of several genetic capture-recapture estimators of population size in a chimpanzee group whose size was independently known. precision and accuracy were superior when calculated on samples collected over 3 years versus 3 months, showing that the positive effect of increased sample size outweighed the potentially negative effect of violating population closure in this slow life-history species."
population abundance estimation with heterogeneous encounter probabilities using numerical integration,abundance estimation; capture-mark-reencounter; huggins estimator; individual heterogeneity; m-h; numerical integration; program mark,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,WHITE GC;COOCH EG,"estimation of population abundance is a common problem in wildlife ecology and management. capture-mark-reencounter (cmr) methods using marked animals are a standard approach, particularly in recent history with the development of innovative methods of marking using camera traps or dna samples. however, estimates of abundance from multiple encounters of marked individuals are biased low when individual heterogeneity of encounter probabilities is not accounted for in the estimator. we evaluated the operating characteristics of the huggins logit-normal estimator through computer simulations, using gaussian-hermite quadrature to model individual encounter heterogeneity. we simulated individual encounter data following a factorial design with 2 levels of sampling occasions (t=5, 10), 3 levels of abundance (n=100, 500, 1,000), 4 levels of median detection probabilities (p=0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) for each sampling occasion (on the probability scale), and 4 levels of individual heterogeneity (sigma(p)=0, 0.5, 1, 2; on the logit normal scale), resulting in a design space consisting of 96 simulation scenarios (2x3x4x4). for each scenario, we performed 1,000 simulations using the huggins estimators m-t, m-0, m-tre, and m-0re, where the re subscript corresponds to the random effects model. as expected, the m-t and m-0 estimators were biased when individual heterogeneity was present but unbiased for sigma(p)=0 data. the estimators for m-tre and m-0re were biased high for n=100 and median p0.2 but showed little bias elsewhere. the bias is attributed to the occasional sets of data that result in a low overall detection probability and a resulting highly skewed sampling distribution of this result is confirmed in that the median of the sampling distributions was only slightly biased high. the random effects estimators performed poorly for sigma(p)=0 data, mainly because a log link function forces the estimate of sigma(p)>0. however, the fletcher statistic provided useful evidence to evaluate sigma(p)>0, as did likelihood ratio tests of the null hypothesis sigma(p)=0. generally, confidence interval coverage of n appears close to the nominal 95% expected when the estimator is not biased. (c) 2017 the wildlife society. estimates of population abundance from multiple encounters of marked individuals are biased low when individual heterogeneity of encounter probabilities is not accounted for in the estimator. through computer simulations, we found that the huggins logit-normal estimator with gaussian-hermite quadrature to integrate out individual random effects eliminates major bias of the abundance estimates with an adequate number of sampling occasions and reasonable detection probabilities."
decline in territory size and fecundity as a response to carrying capacity in an endangered songbird,carrying capacity; cowbird parasitism; density-dependence; integrated population model; population regulation,OECOLOGIA,HARTMANN SA;OPPEL S;SEGELBACHER G;JUINA ME;SCHAEFER HM,"density-dependent processes are fundamental mechanisms for the regulation of populations. ecological theories differ in their predictions on whether increasing population density leads to individual adjustments of survival and reproductive output or to dominance and monopolization of resources. here, we use a natural experiment to examine which factors limit population growth in the only remaining population of the endangered pale-headed brush finch (atlapetes pallidiceps). for three distinct phases (a phase of population suppression, 2001-2002; expansion due to conservation management, 2003-2008; and equilibrium phase, 2009-2014), we estimated demographic parameters with an integrated population model using population size, the proportion of successfully breeding pairs and their productivity, territory size, and mark-recapture data of adult birds. a low proportion of successful breeders due to brood parasitism (0.42, 95% credible interval 0.26-0.59) limited population growth before 2003; subsequent culling of the brood parasite resulted in a two-fold increase of the proportion of successful breeders during the 'expansion phase'. when the population approached the carrying capacity of its habitat, territory size declined by more than 50% and fecundity declined from 1.9 (1.54-2.27) to 1.3 (1.12-1.53) chicks per breeding pair, but the proportion of successful breeders remained constant (expansion phase: 0.85; 0.76-0.93; equilibrium phase: 0.86; 0.79-0.92). this study demonstrates that limiting resources can lead to individual adjustments instead of despotic behavior, and the individual reduction of reproductive output at high population densities is consistent with the slow life-history of many tropical species."
population responses of a native bird species to rat control,abundance estimation; conservation monitoring; forest fragments; mark-recapture; predator control; private land; species recovery; state-space cormack-jolly-seber model,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,ARMSTRONG DP,"invasive-predator control can be beneficial to native species, but it is important to quantify those benefits to ensure they justify the costs. in a previous study (2005-2011), a modified before-after-control-impact (baci) design was used to estimate the effect of rat control in farmland forest fragments on vital rates of north island robins (petroica longipes), a new zealand native bird species often targeted in private restoration initiatives. based on the results, continuous rat control was implemented in 5 fragments predicted to have a high probability of subpopulation growth. here, i report subsequent abundance estimates; the number of robins in those fragments increased from 57 to 134, from 2011-2014, closely matching the prediction of 131 based on the previous vital rate estimates. in comparison, numbers declined or stayed relatively stable over this period in 8 non-controlled fragments, except for 1 fragment that was adjacent to 1 of the controlled fragments and therefore would have received juveniles dispersing from it. therefore, the results illustrate that where there is uncertainty about where to conduct control operations, short-term data on survival and reproduction can be used to predict longer-term effects, allowing predator-control efforts to be done strategically. (c) 2016 the wildlife society. controlling exotic black rats in forest fragments through monthly deployment of toxic cereal baits was highly effective for recovering subpopulations of north island robins, an endemic new zealand passerine. the observed increases in abundance over 3 years were consistent with previous predictions made from survival and reproduction data, indicating that predictions made from such data can be used to strategically adjust predator-control programs."

multinomial n-mixture models improve the applicability of electrofishing for developing population estimates of stream-dwelling smallmouth bass,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,MOLLENHAUER R;BREWER SK,"failure to account for variable detection across survey conditions constrains progressive streamecology and can lead to erroneous stream fish management and conservation decisions. in addition to variable detection's confounding long-term stream fish population trends, reliable abundance estimates across a wide range of survey conditions are fundamental to establishing species-environment relationships. despite major advancements in accounting for variable detection when surveying animal populations, these approaches remain largely ignored by stream fish scientists, and cpue remains the most common metric used by researchers and managers. one notable advancement for addressing the challenges of variable detection is the multinomial n-mixture model. multinomial n-mixture models use a flexible hierarchical framework to model the detection process across sites as a function of covariates; they also accommodate common fisheries survey methods, such as removal and capture-recapture. effective monitoring of stream-dwelling smallmouth bassmicropterus dolomieu populations has long been challenging; therefore, our objective was to examine the use of multinomial n-mixture models to improve the applicability of electrofishing for estimating absolute abundance. we sampled smallmouth bass populations by using tow-barge electrofishing across a range of environmental conditions in streams of the ozark highlands ecoregion. using an information-theoretic approach, we identified effort, water clarity, wetted channel width, and water depth as covariates that were related to variable smallmouth bass electrofishing detection. smallmouth bass abundance estimates derived from our top model consistently agreed with baseline estimates obtained via snorkel surveys. additionally, confidence intervals from the multinomial n-mixture models were consistently more precise than those of unbiased petersen capture-recapture estimates due to the dependency among data sets in the hierarchical framework. we demonstrate the application of this contemporary population estimation method to address a longstanding stream fish management issue. we also detail the advantages and trade-offs of hierarchical population estimation methods relative to cpue and estimation methods that model each site separately."
"effects of passive integrated transponder tag size and implantation site on age-0 walleye and muskellunge tag retention, growth, and survival",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,WEBER MJ;FLAMMANG M,"fisheries management requires an understanding of the processes regulating populations, including recruitment, growth, mortality, emigration, and immigration. tagging provides one of the best methods for addressing these questions, and pit tags represent one of the newest technologies. passive integrated transponder tags generally have high retention rates and minimal effects on fish growth and survival. multiple pit tag sizes are available, but little is known regarding the effects of tag size on tag retention, growth, or survival in fish. thus, our objectives were to evaluate the effects of three pit tag sizes (12, 23, and 32 mm) and two implantation sites (dorsal muscle and body cavity) on tag retention, growth, and survival of age-0 walleyes sander vitreus and muskellunge esox masquinongy. fish (210 individuals per species per year) were randomly assigned to one of six treatments or a control during 2014 and 2015 and were held for 112 d. walleye survival was lower in 2014 (87%) than in 2015 (>99%) but did not vary between implantation sites or among tag sizes; muskellunge survival was 100% during both years. tag retention over 112 d was nearly 100% in walleyes regardless of tagging site or tag size. in muskellunge, tag retention was lower during 2014 (65%) than during 2015 (93%) and was lower when implanted in the body cavity (63%) than in the dorsal muscle (87%); however, tag retention was similar among tag sizes. walleyes and muskellunge grew little over the winter, and growth was generally similar among fish with different implantation sites and tag sizes. collectively, our results indicate that pit tags larger than 12 mm can be successfully used in walleyes and muskellunge and will likely increase the tag detection rates for these species, particularly in studies that use stationary pit tag antennas."
"trends in rainbow trout recruitment, abundance, survival, and growth during a boom-and-bust cycle in a tailwater fishery",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,KORMAN J;YARD MD;KENNEDY TA,"data from a large-scale mark-recapture study were used in an open-population model to determine the cause for long-term trends in growth and abundance of a rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss population in the tailwater of glen canyon dam, arizona. reduced growth affected multiple life stages and processes, causing negative feedbacks that regulated the abundance of the population, including higher mortality of larger fish; lower rates of recruitment (young of the year) during years when growth was reduced; and lower rates of sexual maturation in the following year. high and steady flows during spring and summer 2011 resulted in a very large recruitment event. the population had declined tenfold by 2016 due to a combination of lower recruitment and reduced survival of larger trout. survival rates for 225-mm and larger rainbow trout in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 11, 21, and 22% lower, respectively, than average survival rates between 2012 and 2013. abundance at the end of the study would have been threefold to fivefold higher if survival rates for larger individuals had remained at the elevated levels estimated for 2012 and 2013. growth declined between 2012 and 2014 owing to reduced prey availability, which led to very poor fish condition (similar to 0.90-0.95) by fall 2014. poor condition in turn resulted in low survival rates of larger fish during fall 2014 and winter 2015, which contributed to the population collapse. in glen canyon, large recruitment events driven by high flows can lead to population increases that cannot be sustained due to limitations in prey supply. when the ability to regulate prey supply is lacking, flows that reduce the probability of large recruitment events can be used to avoid boom-and-bust population cycles. our study demonstrates that mark-recapture is a very informative approach for understanding the dynamics of tailwater trout populations."
assessment of early migration dynamics of river-specific hatchery atlantic salmon smolts,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HAWKES JP;SHEEHAN TF;STICH DS,"many atlantic salmon salmo salar populations within the southern extent of the species' range are at critically low abundances, while others have been extirpated. the focus of many ongoing recovery efforts is on maximizing the number of smolts that reach the ocean, where marine survival is low, primarily through hatchery supplementation and improvement of in-river hydropower system management. however, estuaries also are known to be sites of high mortality, although in many cases the correlates of this mortality are poorly characterized. we acoustically tagged hatchery smolts (n = 666) during 2001-2005 to evaluate migration performance through freshwater, estuarine, and bay reaches of the small but tidally dynamic dennys river, maine, usa, to investigate potential drivers contributing to low returns within the system. migration behaviors (e.g., migration timing and tidal use) were typical for atlantic salmon smolts, but reversals during migration were observed upon entry into the estuary environment more frequently in this system than in regional rivers. we used cormack-jolly-seber mark-recapture models to estimate apparent survival within the study environment during this period. we found two distinct periods of survival, with much lower survival in 2003-2005 than in 2001 and 2002 (more than a 40% decrease). among the variables considered, temperature and migratory behavior had the largest effects on survival. we found that survival increased by about 28% across the range of temperatures observed during these years; additionally, survival increased by about 15% for fish that reversed direction during migration compared to fish that did not. these results indicate that extreme environmental changes during the transition through this coastal system constitute a significant obstacle to atlantic salmon restoration stocking efforts."
an assessment of the geographic closure assumption in mark-recapture abundance estimates of anadromous steelhead populations,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,WATHEN G;WEBER N;BENNETT S;BOUWES N;JORDAN CE,"closed population models are commonly used to estimate stream salmonid abundances using mark-recapture information collected during electrofishing surveys. to meet the model assumption of geographic closure, block nets are often used to prevent emigration and immigration of fish during the survey. increased sampling and tagging efforts in an open site may be an appealing trade-off given the time it takes to properly deploy block nets, but it also increases an abundance estimate's vulnerability to bias. we assessed the extent of geographic closure violation from emigration in open sites between mark and recapture passes utilizing pit antennas as virtual block nets. this allowed us to quantify emigration rates of juvenile steelhead oncorhynchus mykiss from 60 fish surveys across multiple seasons and watersheds. our goals were to determine how season and site length influence emigration, examine how the life history of an anadromous salmonid may induce bias on mark-recapture abundance estimates, and provide recommendations on minimizing the bias associated with violating the geographic closure assumption. average emigration rate was low across all surveys and watersheds (5.1%), with higher emigration rates correlating with larger fish, shorter site length, and the season in which the site was sampled. we concluded that the bias associated with violating the geographic closure assumption in an open site can be minimized by avoiding times of migration and by sampling sites up to 650 m long depending on fish density and capture efficiency. our findings provide useful information for planning mark-recapture studies that have multiple sampling objectives."

tributary use by imperiled flannelmouth and bluehead suckers in the upper colorado river basin,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,FRASER GS;WINKELMAN DL;BESTGEN KR;THOMPSON KG,"habitat alterations and establishment of nonnative fishes have reduced the distributions of flannelmouth sucker catostomus latipinnis and bluehead sucker c. discobolus to less than 50% of their historical ranges in the colorado river basin. tributaries are sometimes less altered than main-stem habitat in the basin and may be important to support various life history processes, but their role in the maintenance of flannelmouth sucker and bluehead sucker populations is poorly understood. using mark-recapture techniques, we show tributaries are important habitat for native suckers in the upper colorado river basin and report three main findings. first, both flannelmouth and bluehead suckers likely respond to a thermal cue that initiates spawning movement patterns. suckers moved into coal creek from the white river beginning in mid-may of 2012 and 2013 to spawn. the majority of sucker spawning movements occurred when water temperatures in white river exceeded 11-14 degrees c and those in coal creek were 2.5-4 degrees c warmer, while flows varied between years. second, based on pit tag detection arrays, 13-45% of suckers showed spawning site fidelity. sampling only with fyke nets would have resulted in the conclusion that site fidelity by native suckers was only 1-17%, because nets were less efficient at detecting marked fish. third, most suckers of both species emigrated from coal creek within 48 h after being captured while suckers that were detected only via arrays remained resident for 10-12 d. the posthandling flight response we observed was not anticipated and to our knowledge has not been previously reported for these species. remote pit tag antenna arrays allowed for a stronger inference regarding movement and tributary use by these species than what could be achieved using just fyke nets. tributaries are an important part of flannelmouth sucker and bluehead sucker life history and thus important to conservation strategies for these species."
investigating brushtail possum (trichosurus vulpecula) home-range size determinants in a new zealand native forest,age; density; population structure; possum management; sex,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,RICHARDSON KS;ROUCO C;JEWELL C;FRENCH NP;BUDDLE BM;TOMPKINS DM,"context. the australian brushtail possums (trichosurus vulpecula) introduction to new zealand has exacted a heavy toll on native biodiversity and presented the country with its greatest wildlife reservoir host for bovine tuberculosis (tb). management efforts to control both possums and tb have been ongoing for decades, and the biology of possums has been studied extensively in australia and new zealand over the past 50 years; however, we still do not have a clear understanding of its home-range dynamics. aims. to investigate determinants of home range size by using a uniquely large dataset in the orongorongo valley, a highly monitored research area in new zealand and compare our findings with those of other studies. methods. possum density was estimated, for subpopulations on four 13-ha cage-trap grids, by the spatially explicit capture-mark-recapture analysis of trapping data from 10 consecutive months. home ranges were estimated from trap locations using a 100% minimum convex polygon (mcp) method for 348 individuals and analysed with respect to grid, age and sex. key results. mean (standard error) possum density, estimated as 4.87 (0.19), 6.92 (0.29), 4.08 (0.21) and 4.20 (0.19) ha(-1) for the four grids, was significantly negatively correlated with mean mcp home-range size. grid, age, and the interaction of age and sex were significantly related to home-range size. older possums had larger home ranges than did younger possums. when 'juvenile cohort' and 'adult cohort' data were analysed separately, to investigate the significant interaction, males in the 'adult cohort' had significantly larger home ranges than did females, with the grid effect still being apparent, whereas neither sex nor grid effects were significant for the 'juvenile cohort'. conclusions. our findings indicate that, in addition to density, age and sex are likely to be consistent determinants of possum home-range size, but their influences may be masked in some studies by the complexity of wild-population dynamics. implications. our findings have strong implications regarding both disease transmission among possums and possum management. the fact that adult males occupy larger home ranges and the understanding that possum home range increases as population density decreases are an indication that males may be the primary drivers of disease transmission in possum populations. the understanding that possum home range increases as population density decreases could be a direct reflection of the ability of tb to persist in the wild that counteracts current management procedures. if individuals, and particularly males, infected with tb can withstand control measures, their ensuing home-range expansion will result in possible bacteria spread in both the expanded area of habitation and new individuals becoming subjected to infection (both immigrant possums and other control survivors). therefore, managers should consider potential approaches for luring possum males in control operations."
demographic evaluation of translocating the threatened northern quoll to two australian islands,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,GRIFFITHS AD;RANKMORE B;BRENNAN K;WOINARSKI JCZ,"context translocation is widely used to help avoid extinction of species from threatening processes. a fundamental objective of translocation is to establish self-sustaining populations; estimating demographic parameters is critical to assessing success of these programs and can also be used to support future management actions. aims we estimated demographic parameters to evaluate the success of translocating the northern quoll dasyurus hallucatus to two islands (astell and pobassoo), in response to the threat posed by the introduced cane toad rhinella marina on the australian mainland. methods we used capture-mark-recapture methods to monitor both populations at regular intervals from initial release in 2003 until 2009 and a one-off survey in 2014. key results relative abundance (trap success) increased exponentially in the first 4 years, declined, and then stabilised in subsequent years. the population of female northern quolls on astell island peaked in 2006 with an estimate of 3640 (95% ci 3022-4257), and on pobassoo island the peak was 2007 with 617 (95% ci 531-703) females. in 2014 the population had decreased to 2193 (95% ci 1920-2467) on astell and 451 (95% ci 359-543) on pobassoo. apparent survival and body condition decreased significantly following the population peak, possibly related to density dependence. conclusion both populations of northern quolls reached their regulation phase after going through establishment and growth phases, which included exceeding carrying capacity. the pattern was similar between the populations. implications increased survival and recruitment at threat-free translocation sites contributes to successful establishment of self-sustaining populations."
annual movements of acoustic-tagged white sturgeon in the lower reaches of the fraser river and its tributaries,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,ROBICHAUD D;ENGLISH KK;NELSON TC,"details of the spatial ecology of white sturgeon acipenser transmontanus in the lower fraser river, british columbia, are needed for habitat conservation, assessments of impacts from spatially delimited threats, and refinement of abundance estimation methods. the abundance of threatened lower fraser river white sturgeon is assessed annually using a bayesian, closed-population, mark-recapture model. if individuals make prolonged departures from the lower fraser river, either into marine waters or a tributary, the validity of the model's assumed closed population is questionable. there is also concern that fish might move far enough to be exposed to harvest in puget sound, washington. from 2008 to 2012, white sturgeon of various sizes were acoustically tagged in the pitt river (n = 58) and in the lower reaches of the fraser river (near douglas island, n = 52) to determine the timing, rate, and spatial extent of movements. movements were monitored using acoustic receivers at 17 locations in the lowermost 92 km of the main-stem fraser river, three in the first 21 km of the pitt river (a tributary to the lower fraser river), and nine in the coastal waters of british columbia and washington state. travel speeds showed a strong skew toward slower movements (74% were < 1 km/h) and did not differ significantly between upstream and downstream directions. on average, 33.2% of the sample was mobile (displacing similar to 13.4 km/month) and 66.8% was sedentary (displacing similar to 1.87 km/month). in general, white sturgeon were significantly more sedentary during winter months and more mobile during spring and fall. annual or seasonal migratory movements and patterns were observed for 73% of fish tracked. repeated use of specific locations within the lower pitt river during midwinter suggested white sturgeon have a high fidelity for specific overwintering sites. several of the tagged fish showed annual movements to the lowest reaches of the fraser river for 1-3 months between may and september, although there was no direct evidence that they left the fraser river and entered the strait of georgia. by contrast, there was strong evidence for extended and repeated movement into the lower pitt river. given that the lower pitt river is outside the mark-recapture assessment area, our results suggest either that the area's boundaries need expansion, or alternative models should be considered for abundance estimations of lower fraser river white sturgeon."
"spatial heterogeneity, variable rewards, tag loss, and tagging mortality affect the performance of mark-recapture designs to estimate exploitation: an example using red snapper in the northern gulf of mexico",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,SACKETT DK;CATALANO M,"accurate estimates of exploitation rate are essential to the management of exploited fisheries. tagging studies are often used to estimate exploitation rates, but the performance of these approaches depends strongly on study design characteristics and the magnitude of assumption violations. we simulated a suite of candidate study designs for 1-year high-reward and variable-reward tagging studies, exploring a range of sample sizes (number of tagged fish), exploitation rates, tagging mortality rates, tag loss rates, proportions of double-tagged fish, and spatial variation in fish density, tag releases, and fishing effort. we calculated the uncertainty, biases, and reward costs of these candidate study designs to determine the most cost-effective approach to accurately estimate exploitation rate for red snapper lutjanus campechanus in alabama waters of the gulf of mexico. we also investigated how incorrectly assuming a 100% reporting rate would affect these study results. our simulations demonstrated that using all high-reward tags provided more accurate and precise exploitation rate estimates than the variable-reward approach but only if 100% reporting could be safely assumed. further, distributing tags uniformly over the study area when the true spatial distribution of the population and fishing pressure varied over that area drastically biased exploitation rate estimates, suggesting that prior knowledge of the population's true spatial distribution over the study area is needed to ensure accurate estimates of exploitation rate. the most cost-effective study design involved tagging between 400 and 1,600 fish with high-reward tags, with 40% of the fish double-tagged, and the tags spatially distributed in the same proportion as the population. however, violation of the 100% reporting rate assumption resulted in a proportional downward bias in the estimated exploitation rate. simulation studies such as this are critical to ensure that cost-effective study designs produce accurate and precise estimates of exploitation rate, particularly for high-value species such as red snapper."
assessing reservoir largemouth bass standardized boat electrofishing: effect of catchability on density and size structure indices,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,TYSZKO SM;HANGSLEBEN MA;ZWEIFEL RD;PRITT JJ;CONROY JD,"understanding catchability-the fraction of a stock caught by a defined unit of effort-is crucial to using fisheries assessment data to index abundance. we conducted mark-recapture experiments to estimate catchability and evaluate standard boat electrofishing methods for assessing populations of largemouth bass micropterus salmoides. we then used a resampling analysis to test for differences in bass cpue (fish/h and fish/km) between two high-density reservoirs and one low-density reservoir and among surveys within each reservoir. we compared scenarios using surveys conducted only during (1) the standard time period (mid-april to mid-may) and (2) the entire assessment period (early april to mid-june). we considered the percentage of significant differences in cpue between the high-density and low-density reservoirs to represent statistical power (i.e., the ability to detect a difference in cpue when a difference actually exists) and the percentage of significant differences in cpue between surveys in the same reservoir to represent the false-positive rate (i.e., the detection of a difference in cpue when no difference in density exists). catchability and cpue were greatest and least variable during recapture events conducted during the standard period. the mean catchability of sub-stock length largemouth bass (150-200 mm) and memorable-length bass (>= 510 mm) was significantly less than those for other length categories. statistical power exceeded 80%, and the false-positive rate was generally less than 10% for sampling during the standard period at as few as six electrofishing sites. when including samples from outside the standard period, power was lower and the false-positive rate was as high as 60%. power and false-positive rate were similar whether effort was measured in time or distance. our results emphasize that standardized springtime boat electrofishing assessments validly index largemouth bass density and size structure."

isotopic structure of lake whitefish in lake huron: evidence for regional and local populations based on resource use,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,EBERTS RL;WISSEL B;SIMPSON GL;CRAWFORD SS;STOTT W;HANNER RH;MANZON RG;WILSON JY;BOREHAM DR;SOMERS CM,"lake whitefish coregonus clupeaformis is the most commercially valuable species in lake huron. the fishery for this species has historically been managed based on 25 management units (17 in canada, 8 in the usa). however, congruence between the contemporary population structure of lakewhitefish and management units is poorly understood. we used stable isotopes of carbon (delta c-13) and nitrogen (delta n-15), food web markers that reflect patterns in resource use (i.e., prey, location, habitat), to assess the population structure of spawning-phase lake whitefish collected from 32 sites (1,474 fish) across lake huron. we found large isotopic variation among fish from different sites (ranges: delta c-13 = 10.2 parts per thousand, delta n-15 = 5.5 parts per thousand) and variable niche size and levels of overlap (standard ellipse area = 1.0-4.3 parts per thousand(2)). lake huron contained spawning-phase fish from four major isotopic clusters largely defined by extensive variation in delta c-13, and the isotopic composition of fish sampled was spatially structured both within and between lake basins. based on cluster compositions, we identified six putative regional groups, some of which represented sites of high diversity (three to four clusters) and others with less (one to two clusters). analysis of isotopic values from lake whitefish collected from summer feeding locations and baseline prey items showed similar isotopic variation and established spatial linkage between spawning-phase and summer fish. our results show that summer feeding location contributes strongly to the isotopic structure we observed in spawning-phase fish. one of the regional groups we identified in northern georgian bay is highly distinct based on isotopic composition and possibly ecologically unique within lake huron. our findings are congruent with several previous studies using different markers (genetics, mark-recapture), and we conclude that current management units are generally too small and numerous to reflect the population structure of lake whitefish in lake huron."
causes of mortality in depleted populations of atlantic cod estimated from multi-event modelling of mark-recapture and recovery data,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,FERNANDEZ CHACON A;MOLAND E;ESPELAND SH;KLEIVEN AR;OLSEN EM,"knowledge on mortality causes is key for an effective management of animal populations and can help to restore depleted fish stocks. here we investigated the mortality dynamics of coastal atlantic cod (gadus morhua) in skagerrak, southern norway, by analyzing local mark-recapture and recovery data collected from 2005 to 2013 (n = 9360 fish, mean length = 41 cm, range = 16-93 cm). by applying multi-event models to the data, we could link field observations to multiple ""dead states"" and estimate the proportion of deaths associated with different fishing gears while controlling for unobserved mortality and detection errors. deaths due to hand lines and fixed gear types were dominant compared with other causes, especially in legal-sized cod (>= 40 cm). gear-specific mortality changed over time and between size classes, but annual survival remained low and stable (similar to 0.3). assuming fully additive mortality, we predicted annual survival of cod to be above 0.5 if only one or both of the dominant gear types were removed, providing insights on the relative impact of diverse harvesting practices on local population dynamics."
behavioral connectivity among bighorn sheep suggests potential for disease spread,behavioral connectivity; bighorn sheep; disease; idaho; multi-state mark-recapture; ovis canadensis; salmon river; social groups,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BORG NJ;MITCHELL MS;LUKACS PM;MACK CM;WAITS LP;KRAUSMAN PR,"connectivity is important for population persistence and can reduce the potential for inbreeding depression. connectivity between populations can also facilitate disease transmission; respiratory diseases are one of the most important factors affecting populations of bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis). the mechanisms of connectivity in populations of bighorn sheep likely have implications for spread of disease, but the behaviors leading to connectivity between bighorn sheep groups are not well understood. from 2007-2012, we radio-collared and monitored 56 bighorn sheep in the salmon river canyon in central idaho. we used cluster analysis to define social groups of bighorn sheep and then estimated connectivity between these groups using a multi-state mark-recapture model. social groups of bighorn sheep were spatially segregated and linearly distributed along the salmon river canyon. monthly probabilities of movement between adjacent male and female groups ranged from 0.08 (0.004 se) to 0.76 (+/- 0.068) for males and 0.05 (+/- 0.132) to 0.24 (+/- 0.034) for females. movements of males were extensive and probabilities of movement were considerably higher during the rut. probabilities of movement for females were typically smaller than those of males and did not change seasonally. whereas adjacent groups of bighorn sheep along the salmon river canyon were well connected, connectivity between groups north and south of the salmon river was limited. the novel application of a multi-state model to a population of bighorn sheep allowed us to estimate the probability of movement between adjacent social groups and approximate the level of connectivity across the population. our results suggest high movement rates of males during the rut are the most likely to result in transmission of pathogens among both male and female groups. potential for disease spread among female groups was smaller but non-trivial. land managers can plan grazing of domestic sheep for spring and summer months when males are relatively inactive. removal or quarantine of social groups may reduce probability of disease transmission in populations of bighorn sheep consisting of linearly distributed social groups.

measuring the growth rate in three populations of larval lampreys with mark-recapture techniques,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,EVANS TM,"the growth rate of larval lampreys (ammocoetes) is of critical importance for scientists and managers seeking to better understand, control, and protect lamprey populations. to date, measurements of ammocoete growth have often relied upon indirect methods (e.g., length frequency), but direct measurements of growth rate in wild populations are rare. lamprey ammocoetes in three streams were individually marked with visible implant elastomer and were subsequently recaptured. ammocoete growth was variable among sites and among sample events (from -0.035 to 0.18 mm/d; from -0.0022 to 0.012 g/d), and maturation to the juvenile or adult stage was estimated to take 4-10 years, with some animals possibly requiring more time. american brook lampreys lethenteron appendix grew 0.13 mm/d or 0.0055 g/d on average, whereas the growth of sea lampreys petromyzon marinus was variable, with ammocoetes experiencing significantly higher mean growth at one site (0.12 mm/d; 0.0025 g/d) than at the other site (0.032 mm/d; 0.00039 g/d). these estimates provide support for the generally long growth periods of ammocoetes but also suggest that variability plays a wider role even within populations. the variability in growth rate may provide ammocoetes with a highly flexible life history, allowing them to exploit habitats under a variety of conditions potentially encountered during development."

negative effects of density on space use of small mammals differ with the phase of the masting-induced population cycle,density dependence; home range; mast seeding; population cycles; space use; spatially explicit capture recapture,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BOGDZIEWICZ M;ZWOLAK R;REDOSH L;RYCHLIK L;CRONE EE,"home range size generally decreases with increasing population density, but testing how this relationship is influenced by other factors (e.g., food availability, kin structure) is a difficult task. we used spatially explicit capture-recapture models to examine how home range size varies with population density in the yellow-necked mouse (apodemus flavicollis). the relationship between population density and home range size was studied at two distinct phases of population fluctuations induced by beech (fagus sylvatica) masting: post-mast peak in abundance (first summer after mast, n = 2) and subsequent crash (second summer after mast, n = 2). we live-trapped mice from june to september to avoid the confounding effects of autumn seedfall on home range size. in accordance with general predictions, we found that home range size was negatively associated with population density. however, after controlling for the effect of density, home ranges of mice were larger in post-mast years than during the crash phase. this indicates a higher spatial overlap among neighbors in post-mast years. we suggest that the increased spatial overlap is caused by negative density-dependent dispersal that leads to high relatedness of individuals within population in the peak phase of the cycle."

the value of terrestrial ecotones as refuges for winter damselflies (odonata: lestidae),dragonflies; habitat selection; habitat loss; cryptic behavior; disturbance,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,HARABIS F,"habitat requirements of many species may vary significantly throughout the lifecycle. species are often forced to exchange their habitats to meet requirements of different life stages. due to the effect of human activities, however, there is a loss of habitat complexity and a consequent disappearance of species associated with multiple habitat types. this also applies to freshwater invertebrates occurring in temporary habitats. however, it appears that many species are able to meet their habitat requirements even in a human-altered landscape. the aim of this study was to analyze the habitat preferences of the damselfly sympecma fusca in an area significantly influenced by human interventions. according to the results of a capture-mark-recapture study and generalized additive models, i found that, during a pre-reproductive period (in the autumn), imagoes utilize predominantly insolated ecotones, which constitute only a small fraction of the available terrestrial habitat. during the reproductive period (in spring), however, imagoes completely change their priorities in favor of reproductive success. at this time, males use ecotones only in adverse weather conditions. ecotones allow the species to survive a long pre-reproductive period. however, suitable habitat conditions may be lost because of inappropriate interventions (e.g., mowing). these small-scale interventions often resemble natural disturbances and may not necessarily lead to the extinction of an entire population. imagoes are able to move on to different habitat patches, but only if they have alternative habitats. this outcome indicates that maintaining a high heterogeneity of keystone structures is crucial for maintaining high levels of biodiversity."

sex-specific spatial patterns in the threatened damselfly coenagrion ornatum: implications for the species' conservation and monitoring,dispersal; habitat quality assessment; natura 2000; odonate sampling; spatial ecology,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,TICHANEK F;TROPEK R,"the damselfly coenagrion ornatum is a threatened species, specialized for lowland headwater streams. as the species is declining and protected across europe, it represents a species of particular conservation interest. this work aims to provide the first evaluation of fine-scale spatial ecology in this species, especially to assess its general mobility and distribution of adults in relation to larval habitats, and to suggest implications for conservation and efficient monitoring of this species. adults were captured-recaptured along four distinct streams (5.2 km together) in the radovesicka spoil heap, czech republic. immature adults and breeding individuals were recorded simultaneously. larvae were sampled in 64 sections of 27 m, evenly distributed across the studied streams. in total, 1152 adult individuals were marked; from these, 240 individuals were recaptured at least once. larvae were detected in 21 sites with a total number of 61 individuals. the adults were highly sedentary, with a median lifetime dispersal of 11 m. only one male was reported to move between two distinct streams. model comparisons revealed that female and breeding pair abundances are a significantly more reliable indicator of larval abundance than male and total adult abundances, especially when used along with records of the immature adults. moreover, the weighted least square models showed that the female abundances are spatially more specific (i.e., less autocorrelated) than male abundances. these results imply that surveying the adult females, along with the breeding and immature adults, offers the best method for local habitat quality assessment for this natura 2000 species."
environmental dna from residual saliva for efficient noninvasive genetic monitoring of brown bears (ursus arctos),NA,PLOS ONE,WHEAT RE;ALLEN JM;MILLER SDL;WILMERS CC;LEVI T,"noninvasive genetic sampling is an important tool in wildlife ecology and management, typically relying on hair snaring or scat sampling techniques, but hair snaring is labor and cost intensive, and scats yield relatively low quality dna. new approaches utilizing environmental dna (edna) may provide supplementary, cost-effective tools for noninvasive genetic sampling. we tested whether edna from residual saliva on partially-consumed pacific salmon (oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses might yield suitable dna quality for noninvasive monitoring of brown bears (ursus arctos). we compared the efficiency of monitoring brown bear populations using both fecal dna and salivary edna collected from partially-consumed salmon carcasses in southeast alaska. we swabbed a range of tissue types from 156 partially-consumed salmon carcasses from a midseason run of lakeshore-spawning sockeye (o. nerka) and a late season run of stream-spawning chum (o. keta) salmon in 2014. we also swabbed a total of 272 scats from the same locations. saliva swabs collected from the braincases of salmon had the best amplification rate, followed by swabs taken from individual bite holes. saliva collected from salmon carcasses identified unique individuals more quickly and required much less labor to locate than scat samples. salmon carcass swabbing is a promising method to aid in efficient and affordable monitoring of bear populations, and suggests that the swabbing of food remains or consumed baits from other animals may be an additional cost-effective and valuable tool in the study of the ecology and population biology of many elusive and/or wide-ranging species."
"predators, prey and habitat structure: can key conservation areas and early signs of population collapse be detected in neotropical forests?",NA,PLOS ONE,DE THOISY B;FAYAD I;CLEMENT L;BARRIOZ S;POIRIER E;GOND V,"tropical forests with a low human population and absence of large-scale deforestation provide unique opportunities to study successful conservation strategies, which should be based on adequate monitoring tools. this study explored the conservation status of a large predator, the jaguar, considered an indicator of the maintenance of how well ecological processes are maintained. we implemented an original integrative approach, exploring successive ecosystem status proxies, from habitats and responses to threats of predators and their prey, to canopy structure and forest biomass. niche modeling allowed identification of more suitable habitats, significantly related to canopy height and forest biomass. capture/recapture methods showed that jaguar density was higher in habitats identified as more suitable by the niche model. surveys of ungulates, large rodents and birds also showed higher density where jaguars were more abundant. although jaguar density does not allow early detection of overall vertebrate community collapse, a decrease in the abundance of large terrestrial birds was noted as good first evidence of disturbance. the most promising tool comes from easily acquired lidar data and radar images: a decrease in canopy roughness was closely associated with the disturbance of forests and associated decreasing vertebrate biomass. this mixed approach, focusing on an apex predator, ecological modeling and remote-sensing information, not only helps detect early population declines in large mammals, but is also useful to discuss the relevance of large predators as indicators and the efficiency of conservation measures. it can also be easily extrapolated and adapted in a timely manner, since important open-source data are increasingly available and relevant for large-scale and real-time monitoring of biodiversity."

top-down limitation of lemmings revealed by experimental reduction of predators,capture-mark-recapture; population cycle; population regulation; predator-prey interactions; seasonality; trophic interactions,ECOLOGY,FAUTEUX D;GAUTHIER G;BERTEAUX D,"it is generally recognized that delayed density-dependence is responsible for cyclic population dynamics. however, it is still uncertain whether a single factor can explain why some rodent populations fluctuate according to a 3-4yr periodicity. there is increasing evidence that predation may play a role in lemming population cycles, although this effect may vary seasonally. to address this issue, we conducted an experiment where we built a large exclosure (9ha) to protect brown lemmings (lemmus trimucronatus) from avian and terrestrial predators. we tested the hypothesis that predation is a limiting factor for lemmings by measuring the demographic consequences of a predator reduction during the growth and peak phases of the cycle. we assessed summer (capture-mark-recapture methods) and winter (winter nest sampling) lemming demography on two grids located on bylot island, nunavut, canada from 2008 to 2015. the predator exclosure became fully effective in july 2013, allowing us to compare demography between the control and experimental grids before and during the treatment. lemming abundance, survival and proportion of juveniles were similar between the two grids before the treatment. during the predator-reduction period, summer densities were on average 1.9x higher inside the experimental grid than the control and this effect was greatest for adult females and juveniles (densities 2.4x and 3.4x higher, respectively). summer survival was 1.6xhigher on the experimental grid than the control whereas body mass and proportion of juveniles were also slightly higher. winter nest densities remained high inside the predator reduction grid following high summer abundance, but declined on the control grid. these results confirm that predation limits lemming population growth during the summer due to its negative impact on survival. however, it is possible that in winter, predation may interact with other factors affecting reproduction and ultimately population cycles."
tradeoffs between physical captures and pit tag antenna array detections: a case study for the lower colorado river basin population of humpback chub (gila cypha),humpback chub; pit tag antenna array; hoop-net sampling; demographic parameter estimation; simulation analysis,FISHERIES RESEARCH,PEARSON KN;KENDALL WL;WINKELMAN DL;PERSONS WR,"a key component of many monitoring programs for special status species involves capture and handling of individuals as part of capture-recapture efforts for tracking population health and demography. minimizing negative impacts from sampling, such as through reduced handling, aids prevention of negative impacts on species from monitoring efforts. using simulation analyses, we found that long-term population monitoring techniques, requiring physical capture (i.e. hoop-net sampling), can be reduced and supplemented with passive detections (i.e. pit tag antenna array detections) without negatively affecting estimates of adult humpback chub (hbc; gila cypha) survival (s) and skipped spawning probabilities (gamma ''= spawner transitions to a skipped spawner, gamma' =skipped spawner remains a skipped spawner). based on our findings of the array's in situ detection efficiency (0.42), estimability of such demographic parameters would improve over hoop-netting alone. in addition, the array provides insight into hbc population dynamics and movement patterns outside of traditional sampling periods. however, given current timing of sampling efforts, spawner abundance estimates were negatively biased when hoop-netting was reduced, suggesting not all spawning hbc are present during the current sampling events. despite this, our findings demonstrate that pit tag antenna arrays, even with moderate potential detectability, may allow for reduced handling of special status species while also offering potentially more efficient monitoring strategies, especially if ideal timing of sampling can be determined.

grazed wet meadows are sink habitats for the southern dunlin (calidris alpina schinzii) due to nest trampling by cattle,conservation; dispersal; management; nest trampling; recruitment; restoration; shorebird,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,PAKANEN VM;AIKIO S;LUUKKONEN A;KOIVULA K,"the effect of habitat management is commonly evaluated by measuring population growth, which does not distinguish changes in reproductive success from changes in survival or the effects of immigration or emigration. management has rarely been evaluated considering complete life cycle of the target organisms, including also possible negative impacts from management. we evaluated the effectiveness of cattle grazing in the restoration of coastal meadows as a breeding habitat for small and medium-sized ground-nesting birds by examining the size and demography of a southern dunlin (calidris alpina schinzii) breeding population. using a stochastic renesting model that includes within-season variation in breeding parameters, we evaluated the effect of grazing time and stocking rates on reproduction. the census data indicated that the population was stable when nest trampling was prevented, but detailed demographic models showed that the population on managed meadows was a sink that persisted by attracting immigrants. even small reductions in reproductive success caused by trampling were detrimental to long-term viability. we suggest that the best management strategy is to postpone grazing to after the 19th of june, which is about three weeks later than what is optimal from the farmer's point of view. the differing results from the two evaluation approaches warn against planning and evaluating management only based on census population size and highlight the need to consider target-specific life history characteristics and demography. even though grazing management is crucial for creating and maintaining suitable habitats, we found that it was insufficient in maintaining a viable population without additional measures that increase nest success. in the presently studied case and in populations with similar breeding cycles, impacts from nest trampling can be avoided by starting grazing when about 70% of the breeding season has past."

investigating rates of hunting and survival in declining european lapwing populations,NA,PLOS ONE,SOUCHAY G;SCHAUB M,"understanding effects of harvest on population dynamics is of major interest, especially for declining species. european lapwing vanellus vanellus populations increased from the 1960s until the 1980s and declined strongly thereafter. about 400,000 lapwings are harvested annually and it is thus of high conservation relevance to assess whether hunting was a main cause for the observed changes in lapwing population trends. we developed a multi-event cause-specific mortality model which we applied to a long-term ring-recovery data set (1960-2010) of > 360,000 records to estimate survival and cause-specific mortalities. we found no temporal change in survival over the last 50 years for first-year (fy) and older birds (after first-year; afy) originating from different ringing areas. mean survival was high, around 0.60 and 0.80 for fy and afy individuals, respectively. the proportion of total mortality due to hunting was <0.10 over the study period and the estimated proportion of harvested individuals (kill rate) was <0.05 in each year. our result of constant survival indicates that demographic processes other than survival were responsible for the pronounced change in lapwing population trends in the 1980s. our findings lend support to the hypothesis that hunting was not a significant contributor to the large-scale decline of lapwing populations. to halt the ongoing decline of european lapwing populations management should focus on life history stages other than survival (e.g. productivity). further analyses are required to investigate the contribution of other demographic rates to the decline of lapwings and to identify the most efficient conservation actions."
grizzly bear noninvasive genetic tagging surveys: estimating the magnitude of missed detections,NA,PLOS ONE,FISHER JT;HEIM N;CODE S;PACZKOWSKI J,"sound wildlife conservation decisions require sound information, and scientists increasingly rely on remotely collected data over large spatial scales, such as noninvasive genetic tagging (ngt). grizzly bears (ursus arctos), for example, are difficult to study at population scales except with noninvasive data, and ngt via hair trapping informs management over much of grizzly bears' range. considerable statistical effort has gone into estimating sources of heterogeneity, but detection error-arising when a visiting bear fails to leave a hair sample-has not been independently estimated. we used camera traps to survey grizzly bear occurrence at fixed hair traps and multi-method hierarchical occupancy models to estimate the probability that a visiting bear actually leaves a hair sample with viable dna. we surveyed grizzly bears via hair trapping and camera trapping for 8 monthly surveys at 50 (2012) and 76 (2013) sites in the rocky mountains of alberta, canada. we used multimethod occupancy models to estimate site occupancy, probability of detection, and conditional occupancy at a hair trap. we tested the prediction that detection error in ngt studies could be induced by temporal variability within season, leading to underestimation of occupancy. ngt via hair trapping consistently underestimated grizzly bear occupancy at a site when compared to camera trapping. at best occupancy was underestimated by 50%; at worst, by 95%. probability of false absence was reduced through successive surveys, but this mainly accounts for error imparted by movement among repeated surveys, not necessarily missed detections by extant bears. the implications of missed detections and biased occupancy estimates for density estimation-which form the crux of management plans-require consideration. we suggest hair-trap ngt studies should estimate and correct detection error using independent survey methods such as cameras, to ensure the reliability of the data upon which species management and conservation actions are based."

capture-recapture estimators in epidemiology with applications to pertussis and pneumococcal invasive disease surveillance,NA,PLOS ONE,BRAEYE T;VERHEAGEN J;MIGNON A;FLIPSE W;PIERARD D;HUYGEN K;SCHIRVEL C;HENS N,"introduction surveillance networks are often not exhaustive nor completely complementary. in such situations, capture-recapture methods can be used for incidence estimation. the choice of estimator and their robustness with respect to the homogeneity and independence assumptions are however not well documented. methods we investigated the performance of five different capture-recapture estimators in a simulation study. eight different scenarios were used to detect and combine case-information. the scenarios increasingly violated assumptions of independence of samples and homogeneity of detection probabilities. belgian datasets on invasive pneumococcal disease (ipd) and pertussis provided motivating examples. results no estimator was unbiased in all scenarios. performance of the parametric estimators depended on how much of the dependency and heterogeneity were correctly modelled. model building was limited by parameter estimability, availability of additional information (e.g. covariates) and the possibilities inherent to the method. in the most complex scenario, methods that allowed for detection probabilities conditional on previous detections estimated the total population size within a 20-30% error-range. parametric estimators remained stable if individual data sources lost up to 50% of their data. the investigated nonparametric methods were more susceptible to data loss and their performance was linked to the dependence between samples; overestimating in scenarios with little dependence, underestimating in others. issues with parameter estimability made it impossible to model all suggested relations between samples for the ipd and pertussis datasets. for ipd, the estimates for the belgian incidence for cases aged 50 years and older ranged from 44 to 58/100,000 in 2010. the estimates for pertussis (all ages, belgium, 2014) ranged from 24.2 to30.8/100,000. conclusion we encourage the use of capture-recapture methods, but epidemiologists should preferably include datasets for which the underlying dependency structure is not too complex, a priori investigate this structure, compensate for it within the model and interpret the results with the remaining unmodelled heterogeneity in mind."

overwintering strategies of migratory birds: a novel approach for estimating seasonal movement patterns of residents and transients,migration; movement; multi-state model; neotropical; open robust design; probability of entry; site persistence; state uncertainty; survival,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,RUIZ GUTIERREZ V;KENDALL WL;SARACCO JF;WHITE GC,"our understanding of movement patterns in wildlife populations has played an important role in current ecological knowledge and can inform landscape conservation decisions. direct measures of movement can be obtained using marked individuals, but this requires tracking individuals across a landscape or multiple sites. we demonstrate how movements can be estimated indirectly using single-site, capture-mark-recapture (cmr) data with a multi-state open robust design with state uncertainty model (msord-su). we treat residence and transience as two phenotypic states of overwintering migrants and use time- and state-dependent probabilities of site entry and persistence as indirect measures of movement. we applied the msord-su to data on eight species of overwintering neotropical birds collected in 14 countries between 2002 and 2011. in addition to entry and persistence probabilities, we estimated the proportions of residents at a study site and mean residence times. we identified overwintering movement patterns and residence times that contrasted with prior categorizations of territoriality. most species showed an evidence of residents entering sites at multiple time intervals, with transients tending to enter between peak resident movement times. persistence and the proportion of residents varied by latitude, but were not always positively correlated for a given species.synthesis and applications. our results suggest that migratory songbirds commonly move among habitats during the overwintering period. substantial proportions of populations appear to be comprised of transient individuals, and residents tend to persist at specific sites for relatively short periods of time. this information on persistence and movement patterns should be explored for specific habitats to guide landscape management on the wintering grounds, such as determining which habitats are conserved or restored as part of certification programmes of tropical agroforestry crops. we suggest that research and conservation efforts on neotropical migrant songbirds focus on identifying landscape configurations and regional habitat networks that support these diverse overwintering strategies to secure full life cycle conservation."
demography of the critically endangered balearic shearwater: the impact of fisheries and time to extinction,bycatch; conservation; discards; environmental policies; extinction; marine predator; multievent capture-recapture; population models; survival,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,GENOVART M;ARCOS JM;ALVAREZ D;MCMINN M;MEIER R;WYNN RB;GUILFORD T;ORO D,"world-wide, many seabirds are affected by fisheries in opposing ways: as a source of mortality from bycatch, but also by providing discards as a predictable and abundant food resource. this applies to the balearic shearwater puffinus mauretanicus, the most endangered european seabird, whose time to extinction was estimated at only 40years a decade ago. since the previous assessment, new data and more sophisticated demographic modelling have become available, and new fishing policies from the european union (common fisheries policy, cfp) will apply, posing different scenarios for the viability of the species. thus, there is both an urgent need and an opportunity for a more reliable update of the conservation status of the species. demographic data were collected between 1985 and 2014 at one of the world's largest colonies. most demographic parameters were estimated using multievent capture-recapture modelling. some parameters, such as bycatch rate, immature individual survival and recruitment, were estimated for the first time. we incorporated estimates into stochastic population models to forecast time to extinction and assess the viability under different management scenarios, accounting for upcoming fishing policies. adult survival was much lower than expected (0809, se: 0013) and largely influenced by bycatch, which accounted for a minimum of 0455 (se: 0230) of total mortality. breeding success was positively correlated with discard availability. recruitment started at low rates in 3-year-old birds (0030, se: 00455), increasing in following age classes and was almost complete at 6years. under the present scenario, we predict a time to extinction of 61years (95% ci: 55-69).synthesis and applications. population projections suggest that the actual impact of fisheries on balearic shearwaters is unsustainable and the imminent discard ban under the new common fisheries policy may accelerate the declining trend. this study demonstrates that reducing the bycatch rates of fisheries is an unavoidable and urgent conservation measure for avoiding the extinction of the species. we also advise setting up demographic long-term studies, to allow researchers to diagnose, with reliability, the effectiveness of management actions. these actions will also benefit many other marine top-predator species affected by this anthropogenic impact."

differences in movement pattern and detectability between males and females influence how common sampling methods estimate sex ratio,NA,PLOS ONE,RODRIGUES JFM;COELHO MTP,"sampling the biodiversity is an essential step for conservation, and understanding the efficiency of sampling methods allows us to estimate the quality of our biodiversity data. sex ratio is an important population characteristic, but until now, no study has evaluated how efficient are the sampling methods commonly used in biodiversity surveys in estimating the sex ratio of populations. we used a virtual ecologist approach to investigate whether active and passive capture methods are able to accurately sample a population's sex ratio and whether differences in movement pattern and detectability between males and females produce biased estimates of sex-ratios when using these methods. our simulation allowed the recognition of individuals, similar to mark-recapture studies. we found that differences in both movement patterns and detectability between males and females produce biased estimates of sex ratios. however, increasing the sampling effort or the number of sampling days improves the ability of passive or active capture methods to properly sample sex ratio. thus, prior knowledge regarding movement patterns and detectability for species is important information to guide field studies aiming to understand sex ratio related patterns."
dead or gone? bayesian inference on mortality for the dispersing sex,african lion; age-specific mortality; dispersal; sex differences in mortality; siler model; true survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BARTHOLD JA;PACKER C;LOVERIDGE AJ;MACDONALD DW;COLCHERO F,"estimates of age-specific mortality are regularly used in ecology, evolution, and conservation research. however, estimating mortality of the dispersing sex, in species where one sex undergoes natal dispersal, is difficult. this is because it is often unclear whether members of the dispersing sex that disappear from monitored areas have died or dispersed. here, we develop an extension of a multievent model that imputes dispersal state (i.e., died or dispersed) for uncertain records of the dispersing sex as a latent state and estimates age-specific mortality and dispersal parameters in a bayesian hierarchical framework. to check the performance of our model, we first conduct a simulation study. we then apply our model to a long-term data set of african lions. using these data, we further study how well our model estimates mortality of the dispersing sex by incrementally reducing the level of uncertainty in the records of male lions. we achieve this by taking advantage of an expert's indication on the likely fate of each missing male (i.e., likely died or dispersed). we find that our model produces accurate mortality estimates for simulated data of varying sample sizes and proportions of uncertain male records. from the empirical study, we learned that our model provides similar mortality estimates for different levels of uncertainty in records. however, a sensitivity of the mortality estimates to varying uncertainty is, as can be expected, detectable. we conclude that our model provides a solution to the challenge of estimating mortality of the dispersing sex in species with data deficiency due to natal dispersal. given the utility of sex-specific mortality estimates in biological and conservation research, and the virtual ubiquity of sex-biased dispersal, our model will be useful to a wide variety of applications."
effects of human land-use on africa's only forest-dependent fetid: the african golden cat caracal aurata,bushmeat; camera trap; density; gabon; logging; spatial capture-recapture,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,BAHAA EL DIN L;SOLLMANN R;HUNTER LTB;SLOTOW R;MACDONALD DW;HENSCHEL P,"africa's equatorial forests are threatened by widespread deforestation and bushmeat hunting, with both threats spreading into formerly remote areas due to rapid human population growth and large-scale expansions of commercial resource extraction such as logging and mining, as well as forest clearing for agriculture. many globally threatened species are endemic to these forests, but the potential effects of these threats are not well understood. using the case of the forest-dependent african golden cat, we assess the potential effects of disturbance including logging and hunting on population density. we applied spatially-explicit capture-recapture models to camera trap data to estimate density across a human land-use gradient at five sites in central gabon. we found density was highest at a pristine, undisturbed site (16.23 [+/- 5.84 se] individuals per 100 km(2)) and lowest at a village site with moderate levels of mostly subsistence bushmeat hunting (3.8[+/- 2.23 se] individuals per 100 km(2)). logging concessions can support important densities of the species (10.18 [+/- 3.54 se] and 12.84 [+/- 4.25 se] individuals per 100 km(2)), with the higher estimate of the two for the concession certified by the forest stewardship council (fsc) versus the non-certified concession. while protected intact forests are the main strongholds for golden cats, well-managed logging concessions may also play an important role in the conservation of golden cats and other threatened species.

integrating population dynamics models and distance sampling data: a spatial hierarchical state-space approach,akaike information criterion; density dependence; distance sampling; fin whale (balaenoptera physalus); gaussian process; maximum likelihood estimation; model identifiability; nonlinear autoregressive model; ricker model; spatial modelling; state-space models,ECOLOGY,NADEEM K;MOORE JE;ZHANG Y;CHIPMAN H,"stochastic versions of gompertz, ricker, and various other dynamics models play a fundamental role in quantifying strength of density dependence and studying long-term dynamics of wildlife populations. these models are frequently estimated using time series of abundance estimates that are inevitably subject to observation error and missing data. this issue can be addressed with a state-space modeling framework that jointly estimates the observed data model and the underlying stochastic population dynamics (spd) model. in cases where abundance data are from multiple locations with a smaller spatial resolution (e.g., from mark-recapture and distance sampling studies), models are conventionally fitted to spatially pooled estimates of yearly abundances. here, we demonstrate that a spatial version of spd models can be directly estimated from short time series of spatially referenced distance sampling data in a unified hierarchical state-space modeling framework that also allows for spatial variance (covariance) in population growth. we also show that a full range of likelihood based inference, including estimability diagnostics and model-selection, is feasible in this class of models using a data cloning algorithm. we further show through simulation experiments that the hierarchical state--space framework introduced herein efficiently captures the underlying dynamical parameters and spatial abundance distribution. we apply our methodology by analyzing a time series of line-transect distance sampling data for fin whales (balaenoptera physalus) off the u.s. west coast. although there were only seven surveys conducted during the study time frame, 1991-2014, our analysis detected presence of strong density regulation and provided reliable estimates of fin whale densities. in summary, we show that the integrative framework developed herein allows ecologists to better infer key population characteristics such as presence of density regulation and spatial variability in a population's intrinsic growth potential."
variation in the age of first reproduction: different strategies or individual quality?,capture-mark-recapture; individual heterogeneity; life-history plasticity; reaction norm; trade-off; wandering albatross,ECOLOGY,FAY R;BARBRAUD C;DELORD K;WEIMERSKIRCH H,"although age at first reproduction is a key demographic parameter that is probably under high selective pressure, it is highly variable and the cause of this variability is not well understood. two non-exclusive hypotheses may explain such variability. it could be the expression of different individual strategies, i.e., different allocation strategies in fitness components, or the consequences of individual difference in intrinsic quality, i.e., some individuals always doing better than others in all fitness components. we tested these hypotheses in the wandering albatross investigating relationships between the age at first reproduction and subsequent adult demographic traits. using finite mixture capture recapture modeling, we demonstrate that the age at first reproduction is negatively related to both reproductive performances and adult survival, suggesting that individual quality was an important factor explaining variation in the age at first reproduction. our results suggest that age at first breeding is a good predictor of quality in this long-lived seabird species."

inter-annual and inter-individual variations in survival exhibit strong seasonality in a hibernating rodent,mark-recapture; tamias sibiricus; seasonal survival; hibernation; male-biased mortality,OECOLOGIA,LE COEUR C;CHANTEPIE S;PISANU B;CHAPUIS JL;ROBERT A,"most research on the demography of wild animal populations has focused on characterizing the variation in the mortality of organisms as a function of intrinsic and environmental characteristics. however, such variation in mortality is difficult to relate to functional life history components (e.g. reproduction, dispersal, hibernation) due to the difficulty in monitoring biological processes at a sufficiently fine timescale. in this study, we used a 10-year individual-based data set with an infra-annual timescale to investigate both intra- and inter-annual survival patterns according to intrinsic and environmental covariates in an introduced population of a small hibernating rodent, the siberian chipmunk. we compared three distinct periods related to particular life history events: spring reproduction, summer reproduction and hibernation. our results revealed strong interactions between intrinsic and temporal effects. first, survival of male chipmunks strongly decreases during the reproduction periods, while survival is high and equal between sexes during hibernation. second, the season of birth affects the survival of juveniles during their first hibernation, which does not have long-lasting consequences at the adult stage. third, at an inter-annual scale, we found that high food resource availability before hibernation and low chipmunk densities specifically favour subsequent winter survival. overall, our results confirm that the well-known patterns of yearly and inter-individual variation of mortality observed in animals are themselves strongly variable within a given year, suggesting that they are associated with various functional components of the animals' life history."
contrasting dispersal inference methods for the greater white-toothed shrew,female-biased dispersal; f-statistics; gene flow; genetic assignment; hierarchical structure; immigration; mark-recapture; parentage,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,DUSSEX N;BROQUET T;YEARSLEY JM,"a species' dispersal capability is difficult to quantify but important for a general understanding of a species' ecology and for applied conservation and management efforts. one approach is to use the information from individual genotypes to estimate recent dispersal rates. these genetic methods differ in the way they use the genotype data, their assumptions, and the information they give, but choosing one method over another is complicated by the lack of work that compares these methods on simulated or real data sets. we collected detailed, spatially resolved, individual data on the greater white-toothed shrew (crocidura russula) in western switzerland for which past studies have found an unusual female sex-biased dispersal. we analyzed the movement from 1 cohort of juvenile shrews with 7 published methods (i.e., mark-recapture, parentage analysis; genetic assignment; hierarchical f-statistics; and the programs bayesass, imig, and structure) and used a binomial test to make quantitative comparisons between the results of the methods. our study indicates that the methods are broadly consistent, but parentage analysis appears the most powerful method for analyzing fine-scale dispersal patterns. in a conservation context, where the evaluation of long-term translocation success is critical for species management, the species studied and spatial scale considered will dictate which is the best suited method to estimate dispersal.

management decision making for fisher populations informed by occupancy modeling,camera trap; decision making; fisher; harvest; martes; occupancy; pekania pennanti; trapping,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,FULLER AK;LINDEN DW;ROYLE JA,"harvest data are often used by wildlife managers when setting harvest regulations for species because the data are regularly collected and do not require implementation of logistically and financially challenging studies to obtain the data. however, when harvest data are not available because an area had not previously supported a harvest season, alternative approaches are required to help inform management decision making. when distribution or density data are required across large areas, occupancy modeling is a useful approach, and under certain conditions, can be used as a surrogate for density. we collaborated with the new york state department of environmental conservation (nysdec) to conduct a camera trapping study across a 70,096-km(2) region of southern new york in areas that were currently open to fisher (pekania [martes] pennanti) harvest and those that had been closed to harvest for approximately 65 years. we used detection-nondetection data at 826 sites to model occupancy as a function of site-level landscape characteristics while accounting for sampling variation. fisher occupancy was influenced positively by the proportion of conifer and mixed-wood forest within a 15-km(2) grid cell and negatively associated with road density and the proportion of agriculture. model-averaged predictions indicated high occupancy probabilities (>0.90) when road densities were low (<1 km/km(2)) and coniferous and mixed forest proportions were high (>0.50). predicted occupancy ranged 0.41-0.67 in wildlife management units (wmus) currently open to trapping, which could be used to guide a minimum occupancy threshold for opening new areas to trapping seasons. there were 5 wmus that had been closed to trapping but had an average predicted occupancy of 0.52 (0.07 se), and above the threshold of 0.41. these areas are currently under consideration by nysdec for opening a conservative harvest season. we demonstrate the use of occupancy modeling as an aid to management decision making when harvest-related data are unavailable and when budgetary constraints do not allow for capture-recapture studies to directly estimate density.

demographic shifts related to mycoheterotrophy and their fitness impacts in two cephalanthera species,cephalanthera; loss of photosynthesis; mixotrophy; mycoheterotrophy; orchidaceae,ECOLOGY,SHEFFERSON RP;ROY M;PUTTSEPP U;SELOSSE MA,"evolutionary losses of photosynthesis in terrestrial plants all originate in photosynthetic ancestors. the adaptive context under which this transition happens has remained elusive because of the rarity of plants in which both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic forms exist as a polymorphism. here, we report on demographic patterns in photosynthetic (""green"") and nonphotosynthetic (""albino"") individuals within populations of two such species, cephalanthera damasonium and c. longifolia, which also acquire nutrition from their mycorrhizal hosts (partial mycoheterotrophy). we hypothesized that demographic shifts in albinos relative to greens would include compensatory patterns with respect to fitness, such that maladaptive changes to survival or reproduction would be adaptively countered by changes to other parameters, such as growth probabilities. we tracked individuals in two populations of c. damasonium for 3 yr, and in one population of c. longifolia for 14 yr. we then analyzed vital rates for both phenotypes using general linear mixed models (glmms) and multi-state capture mark-recapture models (cmr), and used these models to develop size-classified, function-based population projection matrices. we estimated fitness as the deterministic population growth rate (.) for each phenotype, and explored the impact of shifts in demographic patterns to albinism via life table response experiments (ltres). mortality differed between greens and albinos, but not similarly across species. albinos generally sprouted less than greens, and flowered more when small but less at other times. albinos typically had a higher probability of fruiting, although their lower flower numbers yielded lower numbers of fruits overall. fitness did not differ significantly among phenotypes. thus, we did not find significant evidence that albinism is adaptive or maladaptive; however, if in fact it is the latter, then we did find evidence of incomplete compensation for declines in survival and reproduction from growth transitions, particularly to small flowering size classes in c. damasonium, and to large vegetative size classes in c. longifolia. these patterns indicate some support for the idea that albinism may lead to the speciation of mycoheterotrophic plants."

an efficient acoustic density estimation method with human detectors applied to gibbons in cambodia,NA,PLOS ONE,KIDNEY D;RAWSON BM;BORCHERS DL;STEVENSON BC;MARQUES TA;THOMAS L,"some animal species are hard to see but easy to hear. standard visual methods for estimating population density for such species are often ineffective or inefficient, but methods based on passive acoustics show more promise. we develop spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) methods for territorial vocalising species, in which humans act as an acoustic detector array. we use secr and estimated bearing data from a single-occasion acoustic survey of a gibbon population in northeastern cambodia to estimate the density of calling groups. the properties of the estimator are assessed using a simulation study, in which a variety of survey designs are also investigated. we then present a new form of the secr likelihood for multi-occasion data which accounts for the stochastic availability of animals. in the context of gibbon surveys this allows model-based estimation of the proportion of groups that produce territorial vocalisations on a given day, thereby enabling the density of groups, instead of the density of calling groups, to be estimated. we illustrate the performance of this new estimator by simulation. we show that it is possible to estimate density reliably from human acoustic detections of visually cryptic species using secr methods. for gibbon surveys we also show that incorporating observers' estimates of bearings to detected groups substantially improves estimator performance. using the new form of the secr likelihood we demonstrate that estimates of availability, in addition to population density and detection function parameters, can be obtained from multi-occasion data, and that the detection function parameters are not confounded with the availability parameter. this acoustic secr method provides a means of obtaining reliable density estimates for territorial vocalising species. it is also efficient in terms of data requirements since since it only requires routine survey data. we anticipate that the low-tech field requirements will make this method an attractive option in many situations where populations can be surveyed acoustically by humans."

jaguar densities across human-dominated landscapes in colombia: the contribution of unprotected areas to long term conservation,NA,PLOS ONE,BORON V;TZANOPOULOS J;GALLO J;BARRAGAN J;JAIMES RODRIGUEZ L;SCHALLER G;PAYAN E,"large carnivores such as jaguars (panthera onca) are species of conservation concern because they are suffering population declines and are keystone species in their ecosystems. their large area requirements imply that unprotected and ever-increasing agricultural regions can be important habitats as they allow connectivity and dispersal among core protected areas. yet information on jaguar densities across unprotected landscapes it is still scarce and crucially needed to assist management and range-wide conservation strategies. our study provides the first jaguar density estimates of colombia in agricultural regions which included cattle ranching, the main land use in the country, and oil palm cultivation, an increasing land use across the neotropics. we used camera trapping across two agricultural landscapes located in the magdalena river valley and in the colombian llanos (47-53 stations respectively; >2000 trap nights at both sites) and classic and spatially explicit capture-recapture models with the sex of individuals as a covariate. density estimates were 2.52 +/- 0.46-3.15 +/- 1.08 adults/100 km(2) in the magdalena valley, whereas 1.12 +/- 0.13-2.19 +/- 0.99 adults/100 km(2) in the colombian llanos, depending on analysis used. we suggest that jaguars are able to live across unprotected human-use areas and co-exist with agricultural landscapes including oil-palm plantations if natural areas and riparian habitats persist in the landscape and hunting of both jaguar and prey is limited. in the face of an expanding agriculture across the tropics we recommend land-use planning, adequate incentives, regulations, and good agricultural practices for range-wide jaguar connectivity and survival."
practical bias correction in aerial surveys of large mammals: validation of hybrid double-observer with sightability method against known abundance of feral horse (equus caballus) populations,NA,PLOS ONE,LUBOW BC;RANSOM JI,"reliably estimating wildlife abundance is fundamental to effective management. aerial surveys are one of the only spatially robust tools for estimating large mammal populations, but statistical sampling methods are required to address detection biases that affect accuracy and precision of the estimates. although various methods for correcting aerial survey bias are employed on large mammal species around the world, these have rarely been rigorously validated. several populations of feral horses (equus caballus) in the western united states have been intensively studied, resulting in identification of all unique individuals. this provided a rare opportunity to test aerial survey bias correction on populations of known abundance. we hypothesized that a hybrid method combining simultaneous double-observer and sightability bias correction techniques would accurately estimate abundance. we validated this integrated technique on populations of known size and also on a pair of surveys before and after a known number was removed. our analysis identified several covariates across the surveys that explained and corrected biases in the estimates. all six tests on known populations produced estimates with deviations from the known value ranging from -8.5% to +13.7% and <0.7 standard errors. precision varied widely, from 6.1% cv to 25.0% cv. in contrast, the pair of surveys conducted around a known management removal produced an estimated change in population between the surveys that was significantly larger than the known reduction. although the deviation between was only 9.1%, the precision estimate (cv = 1.6%) may have been artificially low. it was apparent that use of a helicopter in those surveys perturbed the horses, introducing detection error and heterogeneity in a manner that could not be corrected by our statistical models. our results validate the hybrid method, highlight its potentially broad applicability, identify some limitations, and provide insight and guidance for improving survey designs."
counting cats: spatially explicit population estimates of cheetah (acinonyx jubatus) using unstructured sampling data,NA,PLOS ONE,BROEKHUIS F;GOPALASWAMY AM,"many ecological theories and species conservation programmes rely on accurate estimates of population density. accurate density estimation, especially for species facing rapid declines, requires the application of rigorous field and analytical methods. however, obtaining accurate density estimates of carnivores can be challenging as carnivores naturally exist at relatively low densities and are often elusive and wide-ranging. in this study, we employ an unstructured spatial sampling field design along with a bayesian sex-specific spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) analysis, to provide the first rigorous population density estimates of cheetahs (acinonyx jubatus) in the maasai mara, kenya. we estimate adult cheetah density to be between 1.28 +/- 0.315 and 1.34 +/- 0.337 individuals/100km(2) across four candidate models specified in our analysis. our spatially explicit approach revealed 'hotspots' of cheetah density, highlighting that cheetah are distributed heterogeneously across the landscape. the secr models incorporated a movement range parameter which indicated that male cheetah moved four times as much as females, possibly because female movement was restricted by their reproductive status and/or the spatial distribution of prey. we show that secr can be used for spatially unstructured data to successfully characterise the spatial distribution of a low density species and also estimate population density when sample size is small. our sampling and modelling framework will help determine spatial and temporal variation in cheetah densities, providing a foundation for their conservation and management. based on our results we encourage other researchers to adopt a similar approach in estimating densities of individually recognisable species."

no effect of blood sampling or phytohaemagglutinin injection on postfledging survival in a wild songbird,capture-mark-recapture; house wren; recruitment; troglodytes aedon,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,BOWERS EK;SAKALUK SK;THOMPSON CF,"the injection of phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and sampling of blood are widely used in studies of wild vertebrates to assess components of immune and endocrine function and health state and to obtain genetic material. despite the pervasive use of these techniques in the life sciences, their potential effects on survival are rarely considered. for example, whether injection of the immunogen pha into body parts critical for locomotion (e.g., the prepatagium, or wing web, in birds) affects survival has not been tested. here, we test whether injection of pha into the wing web and blood sampling from nestling house wrens affects their subsequent recruitment and survival as breeding adults. capture-mark-recapture analysis on a large sample of young (n = 20,152 fledglings from 3959 broods) treated over 10 years revealed that neither pha injection nor blood sampling affected individual survival and detection probability. recruitment as a breeder varied among years, but this variation was not attributable to sampling effort, or the percent of all adults identified at the nest during a given year. variation in the percent of adults identified was primarily attributable to the effect of nest depredation on our ability to capture nesting pairs. our results indicating lack of an effect of blood sampling and immune stimulation on survival are encouraging, but we recommend further work to assess the potential negative effects of all commonly used techniques on the survival of study subjects in the wild, including the potential costs associated with mounting various immunological responses."

validation of back-calculated body lengths and timing of growth mark deposition in hawaiian green sea turtles,chelonia mydas; growth rate; line of arrested growth; mark-recapture; oxytetracycline; skeletochronology,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,GOSHE LR;SNOVER ML;HOHN AA;BALAZS GH,"somatic growth rate data for wild sea turtles can provide insight into life-stage durations, time to maturation, and total lifespan. when appropriately validated, the technique of skeletochronology allows prior growth rates of sea turtles to be calculated with considerably less time and labor than required by mark-recapture studies. we applied skeletochronology to 10 dead, stranded green turtles chelonia mydas that had previously been measured, tagged, and injected with otc (oxytetracycline) during mark-recapture studies in hawaii for validating skeletochronological analysis. we tested the validity of back-calculating carapace lengths (cls) from diameters of lags (lines of arrested growth), which mark the outer boundaries of individual skeletal growth increments. this validation was achieved by comparing cls estimated from measurements of the lag proposed to have been deposited closest to the time of tagging to actual cls measured at the time of tagging. measureable otc-mark diameters in five turtles also allowed us to investigate the time of year when lags are deposited. we found no significant difference between cls measured at tagging and those estimated through skeletochronology, which supports calculation of somatic growth rates by taking the difference between cls estimated from successive lag diameters in humerus bones for this species. back-calculated cls associated with the otc mark and growth mark deposited closest to tagging indicated that annual lags are deposited in the spring. the results of this validation study increase confidence in utilization of skeletochronology to rapidly obtain accurate age and growth data for green turtles."
movement and survival of an amphibian in relation to sediment and culvert design,barriers; culverts; dicamptodon; movement; sediment; spatial cormack-jolly-seber; stream amphibians,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,HONEYCUTT RK;LOWE WH;HOSSACK BR,"habitat disturbance from stream culverts can affect aquatic organisms by increasing sedimentation or forming barriers to movement. land managers are replacing many culverts to reduce these negative effects, primarily for stream fishes. however, these management actions are likely to have broad implications for many organisms, including amphibians in small streams. to assess the effects of culverts on movement and survival of the idaho giant salamander (dicamptodon aterrimus), we used capture-mark-recapture surveys and measured sediment in streams with 2 culvert types (i.e., unimproved culverts, improved culverts) and in streams without culverts (i.e., reference streams). we predicted culverts would increase stream sediment levels, limit movement, and reduce survival of idaho giant salamanders. we also determined the effect of sediment levels on survival of salamanders because although sediment is often associated with distribution and abundance of stream amphibians, links with vital rates remain unclear. to estimate survival, we used a spatial cormack-jolly-seber (cjs) model that explicitly incorporated information on movement, eliminating bias in apparent survival estimated from traditional (i.e., non-spatial) cjs models caused by permanent emigration beyond the study area. to demonstrate the importance of using spatial data in studies of wildlife populations, we compared estimates from the spatial cjs to estimates of apparent survival from a traditional cjs model. although high levels of sediment reduced survival of salamanders, culvert type was unrelated to sediment levels or true survival of salamanders. across all streams, we documented only 15 movement events between study reaches. all movement events were downstream, and they occurred disproportionately in 1 stream, which precluded measuring the effect of culvert design on movement. although movement was low overall, the variance among streams was high enough to bias estimates of apparent survival compared to true survival. our results suggest that where sedimentation occurs from roads and culverts, survival of the idaho giant salamander could be reduced. though culverts clearly do not completely block downstream movements of idaho giant salamanders, the degree to which culvert improvements affect movements under roads in comparison to unimproved culverts remains unclear, especially for rare, but potentially important, upstream movements.

scent lure effect on camera-trap based leopard density estimates,NA,PLOS ONE,BRACZKOWSKI AR;BALME GA;DICKMAN A;FATTEBERT J;JOHNSON P;DICKERSON T;MACDONALD DW;HUNTER L,"density estimates for large carnivores derived from camera surveys often have wide confidence intervals due to low detection rates. such estimates are of limited value to authorities, which require precise population estimates to inform conservation strategies. using lures can potentially increase detection, improving the precision of estimates. however, by altering the spatio-temporal patterning of individuals across the camera array, lures may violate closure, a fundamental assumption of capture-recapture. here, we test the effect of scent lures on the precision and veracity of density estimates derived from camera-trap surveys of a protected african leopard population. we undertook two surveys (a 'control' and 'treatment' survey) on phinda game reserve, south africa. survey design remained consistent except a scent lure was applied at camera-trap stations during the treatment survey. lures did not affect the maximum movement distances (p = 0.96) or temporal activity of female (p = 0.12) or male leopards (p = 0.79), and the assumption of geographic closure was met for both surveys (p >0.05). the numbers of photographic captures were also similar for control and treatment surveys (p = 0.90). accordingly, density estimates were comparable between surveys (although estimates derived using non-spatial methods (7.28-9.28 leopards/100km(2)) were considerably higher than estimates from spatially-explicit methods (3.40-3.65 leopards/100km(2)). the precision of estimates from the control and treatment surveys, were also comparable and this applied to both non-spatial and spatial methods of estimation. our findings suggest that at least in the context of leopard research in productive habitats, the use of lures is not warranted."

immigration enhances fast growth of a newly established source population,apparent survival; colonization; leslie matrix; local survival; metapopulation; new colony; population dynamics,ECOLOGY,SANTORO S;GREEN AJ;FIGUEROLA J,"immigration and local recruitment play a central role in determining the growth rate of breeding populations. unraveling these processes in newly established populations is of great importance to increase our understanding of how species change their distributions in response to global change. we studied the largest colony of glossy ibis (plegadis falcinellus) in western europe (established in 1996 in donana, sw-spain) by using capture-recapture methods, count estimates, and projection matrix modeling to: (1) test the effect of resource availability and competition on local recruitment dynamics, (2) investigate the contribution of local recruitment vs. immigration on population growth, and (3) assess the role of this population in source/sink dynamics. we found different dynamics before and after the establishment of satellite colonies in donana in 2004. between 1996 and 2003, the population increased rapidly, fueled by immigrants (approximate to 58 breeding females/yr). between 2003 and 2007, however, both colony size increase and immigration were negligible. immigration played a major role in colony growth, but simultaneously this colony was a source population driving expansion of the species range as suggested by (1) absolute and relative estimates of the observed growth rate relative to that predicted by self-recruitment, and (2) numerous observations of donana-born individuals breeding elsewhere. local recruitment, which was particularly high for first-year individuals (probability >0.8 for the early study years), was not directly related to resource availability or previous-year breeding success. local recruitment decreased rapidly at a threshold population size, however, when other satellite colonies became established at donana. our study suggests that even when recruitment at an early age and high productivity are observed, immigration can still play a pivotal role in promoting the fast growth of new populations at the edge of a species range, at least until density-dependent effects arise. this process can be so fast that within a few years a new population can itself become a source population, further driving range expansion of the species."
beyond climate envelope projections: roe deer survival and environmental change,capreolus capreolus; climate change; lynx lynx; ndvi; predation; roe deer; survival; vegetation,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,DAVIS ML;STEPHENS PA;KJELLANDER P,"research on climate change impacts has focused on projecting changes in the geographic ranges of species, with less emphasis on the vital rates giving rise to species distributions. managing ungulate populations under future climate change will require an understanding of how their vital rates are affected by direct climatic effects and the indirect climatic and non-climatic effects that are often overlooked by climate impact studies. we used generalized linear models and capture-mark-recapture models to assess the influence of a variety of direct climatic, indirect climatic, and non-climatic predictors on the survival of roe deer (capreolus capreolus) at 2 sites in sweden. the models indicated that although direct climatic effects (e.g., precipitation) explained some variation in survival, indirect climatic effects (e.g., an index of vegetation production), and non-climatic effects (hunting by lynx [lynx lynx] and humans) had greater explanatory power. climate change is likely to increase vegetation productivity in northern europe, and, coupled with the positive effects of vegetation productivity on roe deer survival, might lead to population increases in the future. survival was negatively affected by lynx presence where these predators occur and by human harvest in the site that lacked predators. in the future, managers might find that a combination of increased harvest and predation by recovering carnivore populations may be necessary to mitigate climate-induced increases in roe deer survival. considering vegetation availability and predation effects is likely to improve predictions of ungulate population responses to variation in climate and, therefore, inform management under future climate change.

population dynamics of endangered blanding's turtles in a restored area,emydoidea blandingii; mark-recapture; nest depredation; prairie-oak barrens; restoration monitoring; wisconsin,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,REID BN;THIEL RP;PEERY MZ,"habitat protection and restoration are used to promote recovery in endangered reptile species, yet the long-term consequences of these efforts can be difficult to assess. measuring the effects of habitat restoration on turtles can be especially difficult because of long generation times and consequent time lags between restoration activities and population-level responses to these activities. we collected 24 years of mark-recapture, size structure, and nest survival data on a population of international union for conservation of nature (iucn)-endangered blanding's turtles (emydoidea blandingii) inhabiting a large restored wetland-upland complex in wisconsin, usa. we used these data to examine survival and recruitment in the population and the response of individual aggregations of nesting females to recent restoration of an extensive upland prairie-oak barrens nesting habitat. the population exhibited positive growth over the 24-year period (lambda = 1.03) based on temporal asymmetry mark-recapture models. population growth rates were greatest in a recently restored prairie-barrens nesting area because of relatively high recruitment of nesting females. females nesting in the recently restored prairie-barrens habitat were smaller and decreased in size over time compared to females using 2 older nesting areas, suggesting that recruitment was relatively high because of an influx of young breeding females. nest depredation probability decreased with increasing distance from forest edges, suggesting that the recent clearing of woody vegetation in recently restored habitat increased reproductive success. collectively, our results highlight the potential benefits of habitat restoration to turtles and identify upland habitats as a key to promoting population growth in turtles with complex habitat requirements.

contrasting patterns of environmental fluctuation contribute to divergent life histories among amphibian populations,amphibian; bombina variegata; demography; environmental predictability; life history; multievent capture-recapture models; slow-fast continuum,ECOLOGY,CAYUELA H;ARSOVSKI D;THIRION JM;BONNAIRE E;PICHENOT J;BOITAUD S;BRISON AL;MIAUD C;JOLY P;BESNARD A,"because it modulates the fitness returns of possible options of energy expenditure at each ontogenetic stage, environmental stochasticity is usually considered a selective force in driving or constraining possible life histories. divergent regimes of environmental fluctuation experienced by populations are expected to generate differences in the resource allocation schedule between survival and reproductive effort and outputs. to our knowledge, no study has previously examined how different regimes of stochastic variation in environmental conditions could result in changes in both the temporal variation and mean of demographic parameters, which could then lead to intraspecific variation along the slow-fast continuum of life history tactics. to investigate these issues, we used capture-recapture data collected on five populations of a long lived amphibian (bombina variegata) experiencing two distinct levels of stochastic environmental variation: (1) constant availability of breeding sites in space and time (predictable environment), and (2) variable spatio temporal availability of breeding sites (unpredictable environment). we found that female breeding propensity varied more from year to year in unpredictable than in predictable environments. although females in unpredictable environments produced on average more viable offspring per year, offspring production was more variable between years. survival at each ontogenetic stage was slightly lower and varied significantly more from year to year in unpredictable environments. taken together, these results confirm that increased environmental stochasticity can modify the resource allocation schedule between survival and reproductive effort and outputs and may lead to intraspecific variation along the slow-fast continuum of life history tactics."
"age validation of the kerguelen islands brown trout, salmo trutta l., and selection of the otolith optimal zone for investigating chronological data series",age estimation; marking; chronological series; salmonidae; annuli; index,FISHERIES RESEARCH,AYMES JC;VIGNON M;BEALL E;GUERAUD F;GAUDIN P,"the selection of an otolith optimal zone where to obtain interpretable chronological data (e.g. chemical transect, increment width) and valid age estimation is fundamental if otoliths are to be used as an effective tool for investigating life history traits or environments experienced by fish. in the remote sub-antarctic kerguelen islands (49 degrees s, 70 degrees e), introduced brown trout populations are invading the archipelago since the 50's and life histories information is of great interest to understand the invasion dynamics. unfortunately, few studies have used otolith as a tool to estimate brown trout age at these extreme latitudes and little is known about otolith growth and annulus formation in these sub-polar conditions. furthermore, no formal procedure exists at the population level to select an otolith optimal zone where to concomitantly extract chronological data aiming at investigating life history traits and growth chronologies. in this context, the aims of this study were (1) to validate the otolith age estimation method by the determination of the position of the first annulus and the annual formation of subsequent annuli; (2) to define an optimal zone where chronological data could be coupled to age estimates. a brown trout population located near the port-au-francais station was studied and sampled repeatedly using mark-recapture method and alizarin red s marking. after to 2 years of recaptures 53 sagittae were analysed. a composite index was created to select an optimal zone where chronological data transects have the maximum probabilities to cross readable annuli. results showed that brown trout forms annuli at the end of september, starting with the first winter after the december hatching. annulus formation up to 2 years after marking was validated. the area between 80 degrees and 120 degrees perpendicular to the rostrum/core axis was optimal for the positioning of data transect. the proposed formal approach allows distinguishing the zone that identifies the best compromise between spatial resolution and precise annulus positioning along otolith chronological series.

movement behavior and host location ability of corythucha ciliata,NA,PLOS ONE,WU HW;LIU HX,"insect movement behavior is highly important in entomological population ecology, behavioral ecology and conservation, and in invasion ecology. in this study, we used an exotic lace bug (corythucha ciliata) as a model organism to address the hypothesis that an insect species invading a new area has a high host location ability and rapid mobility by which it can be successfully carried to a new habitat. to test this hypothesis, three movement parameters (speed, duration and distance) of c. ciliata were assessed using laboratory and field observations. we found that 5th-instar nymphs of c. ciliata could move as far as 750 cm throughout their lifespan and that they moved an average of 0.038 m/ min during the first 15 minutes after release, which was significantly farther than that of other instars. of the tested nymphs, 21.85% could locate their host trees; of adults released 20 m from hosts, 11% reached the host trees on the first day, with an average flight distance of 22.14 m and a maximum flight distance of 27 m. the results of this study partly explain the mechanism of rapid diffusion. these results are also important for predicting population spread, improving eradication surveys, and managing future introductions of c. ciliata."
the first estimates of marbled cat pardofelis marmorata population density from bornean primary and selectively logged forest,NA,PLOS ONE,HEARN AJ;ROSS J;BERNARD H;ABU BAKAR S;HUNTER LTB;MACDONALD DW,"the marbled cat pardofelis marmorata is a poorly known wild cat that has a broad distribution across much of the indomalayan ecorealm. this felid is thought to exist at low population densities throughout its range, yet no estimates of its abundance exist, hampering assessment of its conservation status. to investigate the distribution and abundance of marbled cats we conducted intensive, felid-focused camera trap surveys of eight forest areas and two oil palm plantations in sabah, malaysian borneo. study sites were broadly representative of the range of habitat types and the gradient of anthropogenic disturbance and fragmentation present in contemporary sabah. we recorded marbled cats from all forest study areas apart from a small, relatively isolated forest patch, although photographic detection frequency varied greatly between areas. no marbled cats were recorded within the plantations, but a single individual was recorded walking along the forest/plantation boundary. we collected sufficient numbers of marbled cat photographic captures at three study areas to permit density estimation based on spatially explicit capture-recapture analyses. estimates of population density from the primary, lowland danum valley conservation area and primary upland, tawau hills park, were 19.57 (sd: 8.36) and 7.10 (sd: 1.90) individuals per 100 km(2), respectively, and the selectively logged, lowland tabin wildlife reserve yielded an estimated density of 10.45 (sd: 3.38) individuals per 100 km(2). the low detection frequencies recorded in our other survey sites and from published studies elsewhere in its range, and the absence of previous density estimates for this felid suggest that our density estimates may be from the higher end of their abundance spectrum. we provide recommendations for future marbled cat survey approaches."

the influence of mark-recapture sampling effort on estimates of rock lobster survival,NA,PLOS ONE,KORDJAZI Z;FRUSHER S;BUXTON C;GARDNER C;BIRD T,"five annual capture-mark-recapture surveys on jasus edwardsii were used to evaluate the effect of sample size and fishing effort on the precision of estimated survival probability. datasets of different numbers of individual lobsters (ranging from 200 to 1,000 lobsters) were created by random subsampling from each annual survey. this process of random subsampling was also used to create 12 datasets of different levels of effort based on three levels of the number of traps (15, 30 and 50 traps per day) and four levels of the number of sampling-days (2, 4, 6 and 7 days). the most parsimonious cormack-jolly-seber (cjs) model for estimating survival probability shifted from a constant model towards sex-dependent models with increasing sample size and effort. a sample of 500 lobsters or 50 traps used on four consecutive sampling-days was required for obtaining precise survival estimations for males and females, separately. reduced sampling effort of 30 traps over four sampling days was sufficient if a survival estimate for both sexes combined was sufficient for management of the fishery."
"survival during the breeding season: nest stage, parental sex, and season advancement affect reed warbler survival",NA,PLOS ONE,WIERUCKA K;HALUPKA L;KLIMCZUK E;SZTWIERTNIA H,"avian annual survival has received much attention, yet little is known about seasonal patterns in survival, especially of migratory passerines. in order to evaluate survival rates and timing of mortality within the breeding season of adult reed warblers (acrocephalus scirpaceus), mark-recapture data were collected in southwest poland, between 2006 and 2012. a total of 612 individuals (304 females and 308 males) were monitored throughout the entire breeding season, and their capture-recapture histories were used to model survival rates. males showed higher survival during the breeding season (0.985, 95% ci: 0.941-0.996) than females (0.869, 95% ci: 0.727-0.937). survival rates of females declined with the progression of the breeding season (from may to august), while males showed constant survival during this period. we also found a clear pattern within the female (but not male) nesting cycle: survival was significantly lower during the laying, incubation, and nestling periods (0.934, 95% ci: 0.898-0.958), when birds spent much time on the nest, compared to the nest building and fledgling periods (1.000, 95% ci: 1.00-1.000), when we did not record any female mortality. these data (coupled with some direct evidence, like bird corpses or blood remains found next to/on the nest) may suggest that the main cause of adult mortality was on-nest predation. the calculated survival rates for both sexes during the breeding season were high compared to annual rates reported for this species, suggesting that a majority of mortality occurs at other times of the year, during migration or wintering. these results have implications for understanding survival variation within the reproductive period as well as general trends of avian mortality."
use of photo-identification and mark-recapture methodology to assess basking shark (cetorhinus maximus) populations,NA,PLOS ONE,GORE MA;FREY PH;ORMOND RF;ALLAN H;GILKES G,"following centuries of exploitation, basking sharks (cetorhinus maximus) are considered by iucn as endangered in the northeast atlantic, where they have now been substantially protected for over two decades. however, the present size of this population remains unknown. we investigated the use of photo-identification of individuals' dorsal fins, combined with mark-recapture methodology, to investigate the size of populations of basking shark within the west coast of scotland. from a total of 921 encounters photographed between 2004 and 2011, 710 sharks were found to be individually identifiable based on dorsal fin damage and natural features. of these, only 41 individuals were re-sighted, most commonly both within days of, and close to the site of, the initial encounter. a smaller number were re-sighted after longer periods of up to two years. a comparison of the distinguishing features of individuals on first recording and subsequent re-sighting showed that in almost all cases these features remained little changed, suggesting the low re-sighting rate was not due to a loss of distinguishing features. because of the low number of re-sighting we were not able to produce reliable estimates for the long-term regional population. however, for one 50 km diameter study area between the islands of mull, coll and tiree, we were able to generate closed-population estimates for 6-9 day periods in 2010 of 985 (95% ci = 494-1683), and in 2011 of 201 (95% ci = 143-340). for the same 2011 period an open-population model generated a similar estimate of 213 (95% ci = 111-317). otherwise the low rate and temporal patterning of re-sightings support the view that such local basking shark populations are temporary, dynamic groupings of individuals drawn from a much larger regional population than previously supposed. the study demonstrated the feasibility and limitations of photo-identification as a non-invasive technique for identifying individual basking sharks."
integrated population modelling reveals a perceived source to be a cryptic sink,capture-mark-recapture; demography; density dependence; dispersal; extinction risk; hierarchical model; long-distance migrant bird; metapopulation model,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,WEEGMAN MD;BEARHOP S;FOX AD;HILTON GM;WALSH AJ;MCDONALD JL;HODGSON DJ,"demographic links among fragmented populations are commonly studied as source-sink dynamics, whereby source populations exhibit net recruitment and net emigration, while sinks suffer net mortality but enjoy net immigration. it is commonly assumed that large, persistent aggregations of individuals must be sources, but this ignores the possibility that they are sinks instead, buoyed demographically by immigration. we tested this assumption using bayesian integrated population modelling of greenland white-fronted geese (anser albifrons flavirostris) at their largest wintering site (wexford, ireland), combining capture-mark-recapture, census and recruitment data collected from 1982 to 2010. management for this subspecies occurs largely on wintering areas; thus, study of source-sink dynamics of discrete regular wintering units provides unprecedented insights into population regulation and enables identification of likely processes influencing population dynamics at wexford and among 70 other greenland white-fronted goose wintering subpopulations. using results from integrated population modelling, we parameterized an age-structured population projection matrix to determine the contribution of movement rates (emigration and immigration), recruitment and mortality to the dynamics of the wexford subpopulation. survival estimates for juvenile and adult birds at wexford and adult birds elsewhere fluctuated over the 29-year study period, but were not identifiably different. however, per capita recruitment rates at wexford in later years (post-1995) were identifiably lower than in earlier years (pre-1995). the observed persistence of the wexford subpopulation was only possible with high rates of immigration, which exceeded emigration in each year. thus, despite its apparent stability, wexford has functioned as a sink over the entire study period. these results demonstrate that even large subpopulations can potentially be sinks, and that movement dynamics (e.g. immigration) among winters can dramatically obscure key processes driving subpopulation size. further, novel population models which integrate capture-mark-recapture, census and recruitment data are essential to correctly ascribing source-sink status and accurately informing development of site-safeguard networks."

handled with care: minimal impacts of appendage damage on the growth and productivity of the southern rock lobster (jasus edwardsii),growth; handling damage; bayesian; southern rock lobster; jasus edwardsii,FISHERIES RESEARCH,EMERY TJ;HARTMANN K;GREEN BS;GARDNER C,"the capture, handling and release of invertebrates such as lobsters during commercial fishing operations can lead to physiological changes such as reduced growth and impaired reproduction. in particular, damage to appendages can reduce the exploitable biomass available to fishers as moulting lobsters expend energy resources regrowing limbs at the expense of increasing in size. to assess the effect of injuries on the growth of male and female lobsters smaller than the legal minimum size (undersize), a bayesian hierarchical approach was taken to fit the parameters of the von bertalanffy growth equation to mark-recapture observer data from southern stock assessment areas (ssaas) of the tasmanian southern rock lobster (tsrl) fishery in australia. while the effect or handling damage on the growth of undersize females could not be distinguished from zero because of small growth increments, the impact on males was marked, with damage to antennae or legs estimated to have a similar proportional impact on growth of 7% (0-16%, 95% ci) and 7% (0-14%, 95% ci) respectively. damage to both antennae and legs had a greater estimated proportional impact on growth of 40% (24-57%, 95% ci). despite the substantial reductions in predicted growth caused by the loss of antennae and/or legs, fewer than 6% of undersize male lobsters had these types of injuries. with an estimated 4.22 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- 95% ci) million lobsters discarded annually between 2001 and 2010 from ssaas, annual lost productivity and revenue from slower growth was predicted to be 1.6 tonnes and aud $72,905 respectively in the tsrl fishery. the overall impact of damage on male lobsters was less than 1% of the total allowable catch and revenue for the tsrl fishery in 2010. mortality among damaged lobsters was estimated at 3.9% from ssaas for a total productivity loss of 22.1 tonnes in the tsrl fishery. these results highlight the effectiveness of the fishing method, sorting procedures, as well as management measures (escape gaps) and the biology of the species in reducing excessive amounts of handling damage in the tsrl fishery.

linking vital rates of landbirds on a tropical island to rainfall and vegetation greenness,NA,PLOS ONE,SARACCO JF;RADLEY P;PYLE P;ROWAN E;TAYLOR R;HELTON L,"remote tropical oceanic islands are of high conservation priority, and they are exemplified by range-restricted species with small global populations. spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall and plant productivity may be important in driving dynamics of these species. yet, little is known about environmental influences on population dynamics for most islands and species. here we leveraged avian capture-recapture, rainfall, and remote-sensed habitat data (enhanced vegetation index [evi]) to assess relationships between rainfall, vegetation greenness, and demographic rates (productivity, adult apparent survival) of three native bird species on saipan, northern mariana islands: rufous fantail (rhipidura rufifrons), bridled white-eye (zosterops conspicillatus), and golden white-eye (cleptornis marchei). rainfall was positively related to vegetation greenness at all but the highest rainfall levels. temporal variation in greenness affected the productivity of each bird species in unique ways. predicted productivity of rufous fantail was highest when dry and wet season greenness values were high relative to site-specific 5-year seasonal mean values (i.e., relative greenness); while the white-eye species had highest predicted productivity when relative greenness contrasted between wet and dry seasons. survival of rufous fantail and bridled white eye was positively related to relative dry-season greenness and negatively related to relative wet-season greenness. bridled white-eye survival also showed evidence of a positive response to overall greenness. our results highlight the potentially important role of rainfall regimes in affecting population dynamics of species on oceanic tropical islands. understanding linkages between rainfall, vegetation, and animal population dynamics will be critical for developing effective conservation strategies in this and other regions where the seasonal timing, extent, and variability of rainfall is expected to change in the coming decades."
"photographic identification of individuals of a free-ranging, small terrestrial vertebrate",abundance; capture-recapture; lizard; natural markings; non-invasive,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,TREILIBS CE;PAVEY CR;HUTCHINSON MN;BULL CM,"recognition of individuals within an animal population is central to a range of estimates about population structure and dynamics. however, traditional methods of distinguishing individuals, by some form of physical marking, often rely on capture and handling which may affect aspects of normal behavior. photographic identification has been used as a less-invasive alternative, but limitations in both manual and computer-automated recognition of individuals are particularly problematic for smaller taxa (<500g). in this study, we explored the use of photographic identification for individuals of a free-ranging, small terrestrial reptile using (a) independent observers, and (b) automated matching with the interactive individual identification system ((is)-s-3 pattern) computer algorithm. we tested the technique on individuals of an australian skink in the egernia group, slater's skink liopholis slateri, whose natural history and varied scale markings make it a potentially suitable candidate for photo-identification. from photographic captures' of skink head profiles, we designed a multi-choice key based on alternate character states and tested the abilities of observers with or without experience in wildlife survey to identify individuals using categorized test photos. we also used the (is)-s-3 pattern algorithm to match the same set of test photos against a database of 30 individuals. experienced observers identified a significantly higher proportion of photos correctly (74%) than those with no experience (63%) while the (is)-s-3 software correctly matched 67% as the first ranked match and 83% of images in the top five ranks. this study is one of the first to investigate photo identification with a free-ranging small vertebrate. the method demonstrated here has the potential to be applied to the developing field of camera-traps for wildlife survey and thus a wide range of survey and monitoring applications."

"effects of photo and genotype-based misidentification error on estimates of survival, detection and state transition using multistate survival models",NA,PLOS ONE,WINIARSKI KJ;MCGARIGAL K,"we simulated multistate capture histories (chs) by varying state survival (phi), detection (p) and transition (psi), number of total capture occasions and releases per capture occasion and then modified these scenarios to mimic false rejection error (fre), a common misidentification error, resulting from the failure to match samples of the same individual. we then fit a multistate model and estimated accuracy, bias and precision of state-specific phi, p and psi to better understand the effects of fre on different simulation scenarios. as expected, phi, and p, decreased in accuracy with fre, with lower accuracy when chs were simulated under a shorter-term study and a lower number of releases per capture occasion (lower sample size). accuracy of. estimates were robust to fre except in those ch scenarios simulated using low sample size. the effect of fre on bias was not consistent among parameters and differed by ch scenario. as expected, phi was negatively biased with increased fre (except for the low. low p ch scenario simulated with a low sample size), but we found that the magnitude of bias differed by scenario (high p ch scenarios were more negatively biased). state transition was relatively unbiased, except for the low p ch scenarios simulated with a low sample size, which were positively biased with fre, and high p ch scenarios simulated with a low sample size. the effect of fre on precision was not consistent among parameters and differed by scenario and sample size. precision of phi decreased with fre and was lowest with the low phi low p ch scenarios. precision of p estimates also decreased with fre under all scenarios, except the low phi high p ch scenarios. however, precision of psi increased with fre, except for those ch scenarios simulated with a low sample size. our results demonstrate how fre leads to loss of accuracy in parameter estimates in a multistate model with the exception of. when estimated using an adequate sample size."
first direct evidence for natal wintering ground fidelity and estimate of juvenile survival in the new zealand southern right whale eubalaena australis,NA,PLOS ONE,CARROLL EL;FEWSTER RM;CHILDERHOUSE SJ;PATENAUDE NJ;BOREN L;BAKER CS,"juvenile survival and recruitment can be more sensitive to environmental, ecological and anthropogenic factors than adult survival, influencing population-level processes like recruitment and growth rate in long-lived, iteroparous species such as southern right whales. conventionally, southern right whales are individually identified using callosity patterns, which do not stabilise until 6-12 months, by which time the whale has left its natal wintering grounds. here we use dna profiling of skin biopsy samples to identify individual southern right whales from year of birth and document their return to the species' primary wintering ground in new zealand waters, the subantarctic auckland islands. we find evidence of natal fidelity to the new zealand wintering ground by the recapture of 15 of 57 whales, first sampled in year of birth and available for subsequent recapture, during winter surveys to the auckland islands in 1995-1998 and 2006-2009. four individuals were recaptured at the ages of 9 to 11, including two females first sampled as calves in 1998 and subsequently resampled as cows with calves in 2007. using these capture-recapture records of known-age individuals, we estimate changes in survival with age using cormack-jolly-seber models. survival is modelled using discrete age classes and as a continuous function of age. using a bootstrap method to account for uncertainty in model selection and fitting, we provide the first direct estimate of juvenile survival for this population. our analyses indicate a high annual apparent survival for juveniles at between 0.87 (standard error (se) 0.17, to age 1) and 0.95 (se 0.05: ages 2-8). individual identification by dna profiling is an effective method for long-term demographic and genetic monitoring, particularly in animals that change identifiable features as they develop or experience tag loss over time."
hiding in plain sight: a case for cryptic metapopulations in brook trout (salvelinus fontinalis),NA,PLOS ONE,KAZYAK DC;HILDERBRAND RH;KING TL;KELLER SR;CHHATRE VE,"a fundamental issue in the management and conservation of biodiversity is how to define a population. spatially contiguous fish occupying a stream network have often been considered to represent a single, homogenous population. however, they may also represent multiple discrete populations, a single population with genetic isolation-by-distance, or a metapopulation. we used microsatellite dna and a large-scale mark-recapture study to assess population structure in a spatially contiguous sample of brook trout (salvelinus fontinalis), a species of conservation concern. we found evidence for limited genetic exchange across small spatial scales and in the absence of barriers to physical movement. markrecapture and stationary passive integrated transponder antenna records demonstrated that fish from two tributaries very seldom moved into the opposite tributary, but movements between the tributaries and mainstem were more common. using bayesian genetic clustering, we identified two genetic groups that exhibited significantly different growth rates over three years of study, yet survival rates were very similar. our study highlights the importance of considering the possibility of multiple genetically distinct populations occurring within spatially contiguous habitats, and suggests the existence of a cryptic metapopulation: a spatially continuous distribution of organisms exhibiting metapopulation-like behaviors."
"habitat preference for fire scars by feral cats in cape york peninsula, australia",NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,MCGREGOR HW;CLIFF HB;KANOWSKI J,"context. feral cats are implicated in the decline of terrestrial native mammals across northern australia. research in the kimberley region of north-western australia found feral cats strongly selected for fire scars when hunting, suggesting that intensifying fire regimes will have severe consequences for declining prey species. aims. we tested the generality of cat-fire interaction beyond the kimberley, by measuring habitat selection of feral cats in relation to fire scars and habitat types in north-eastern australia. methods. our study was conducted at piccaninny plains wildlife sanctuary, cape york peninsula. we live-captured feral cats during the dry season of 2015, released them with gps collars set to record fixes at 15-min intervals, and recaptured cats 4 months later. we created dynamic habitat maps of vegetation types, fire and wetlands, and compared cat habitat selection using discrete choice modelling. we also measured cat density from arrays of camera traps and examined cat diet by analysis of stomach contents. key results. we obtained gps movement data from 15 feral cats. feral cats selected strongly for recent fire scars (1 or 2 months old), but avoided fire scars 3 months old or older. three long-distance movements were recorded, all directed towards recent fire scars. cats also selected for open wetlands, and avoided rainforests. density of cats at piccaninny plains was higher than recorded elsewhere in northern australia. all major vertebrate groups were represented in cat diet. conclusions. we showed that feral cats in north-eastern australia strongly select for recent fire scars and open wetlands. these results are consistent with those from the kimberley. together, these studies have shown that amplified predation facilitated by loss of cover is likely to be a fundamental factor driving mammal decline across northern australia."

density and activity patterns of pumas in hunted and non-hunted areas in central argentina,calden forest; camera surveys; hunting; mark-resight; population density; puma concolor,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,ZANON MARTINEZ JI;KELLY MJ;MESA CRUZ JB;SARASOLA JH;DEHART C;TRAVAINI A,"context. hunting has demographic effects on large and medium carnivores, causing population reductions and even extinctions worldwide. yet, there is little information on carnivore demographic parameters and spatial and temporal land-use patterns in areas experiencing sport hunting, thus hindering effective conservation plans for such areas. aims. we estimated densities and determined activity patterns of pumas (puma concolor) from camera-trapping surveys in a protected area and in a game reserve with sport hunting, in the calden forest of central argentina. methods. we used both non-spatial and spatial mark-resight techniques to estimate and compare puma densities and we used kernel-density estimation (kde) techniques to analyse and compare puma activity patterns between study sites. key results. puma densities estimated from spatial models were lower than densities estimated from non-spatial mark-resight techniques. however, estimated density of pumas in the protected area was always higher (range = 4.89-9.32 per 100 km(2)) than in the game reserve (range = 0.52-1.98 per 100 km(2)), regardless of the estimation technique used. trapping rates for large mammal prey were similar across sites. pumas exhibited more nocturnal behaviour and high activity peaks at 0600 hours and 1100 hours in the hunted game reserve, whereas puma activity was spread more evenly around the clock in the protected area. conclusions. the higher puma densities in the protected area reflect the potential for such areas to function as refugia in a human-dominated landscape. however, the game reserve had a lower puma density than the protected area despite high trap rates of large prey, indicating that these areas may function as attractive sinks. implications. our results could indicate that puma sport hunting in the calden forest should be managed at a metapopulation, regional level, and include both no-hunting areas (protected area, as potential sources) and hunting areas (game reserves, as potential sinks). considering that our study areas were small and that this was an unreplicated study, we urge more research to be conducted, so as to determine whether sport hunting is compatible with puma conservation in the region."
double-observer evaluation of pronghorn aerial line-transect surveys,antilocapra americana; detection bias; distance sampling; mark-recapture; population estimation,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,SMYSER TJ;GUENZEL RJ;JACQUES CN;GARTON EO,"context. distance sampling is used to estimate abundance for several taxa, including pronghorn (antilocapra americana). comparisons between population estimates derived from quadrat sampling and distance sampling suggest that distance sampling underestimates pronghorn density, likely owing to violations of the critical assumption of distance sampling that all pronghorn within the innermost distance band (a band; nearest to the aircraft) are detected. aims. we sought to rigorously test the assumption that all pronghorn clusters are detected within the innermost distance band by applying a double-observer approach to an established pronghorn aerial-survey protocol. additionally, we evaluated potential effects of cluster size, landscape composition and seat position (front seat versus rear) on the probability of detection. methods. we conducted aerial line-transect distance-sampling surveys using independent, paired observers and modelled the probability of detection with mark-recapture distance-sampling (mrds) analysis techniques that explicitly estimate the probability of detection for pronghorn clusters in the innermost distance band. we compared density estimates produced by themrdsanalysis with those produced by multiple-covariate distance sampling (mcds), a method that assumes complete detection for clusters on the transect line. key results. weidentified violations of the assumption that all clusters within the innermost distance band were detected, which would contribute to proportional biases in density estimates for analysis techniques that assume complete detection. the frequency of missed clusters was modest from the front-seat position, with 45 of the 47 (96%) clusters in the a band detected. in contrast, the frequency of missed clusters was more substantial for the rear position, from which 37 of 47 (79%) clusters in the a band were detected. further, our analysis showed that cluster size and landscape composition were important factors for pronghorn sightability. conclusions. when implementing standard survey methodologies, pronghorn aerial-line transect surveys underestimated population densities. a double-observer survey configuration allowed us to quantify and correct for the bias caused by the failure of observers to detect all pronghorn clusters within the innermost distance band. implications. population monitoring programs should incorporate double-observer validation trials to quantify the extent of bias owing to undetected clusters within the innermost distance band realised under typical survey conditions. wildlife managers can improve the precision of pronghorn aerial line-transect surveys by incorporating cluster size and measures of landscape composition and complexity into detection models without incurring additional survey costs."
modelling survival and breeding dispersal to unobservable nest sites,blue penguin; breeding-site fidelity; capture-recapture; merging information; multi-event model; seabirds,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,TAVECCHIA G;SANZ AGUILAR A;CANNELL B,"context demographic parameters in wildlife populations are typically estimated by monitoring a limited number of individuals in observable sites and assuming that these are representative of the whole population. if individuals permanently disperse to unobservable breeding sites, recruitment and immature survival are expected to be negatively biased and breeding-site fidelity cannot be investigated. aims to develop a method to obtain unbiased estimated of survival, recruitment and breeding dispersal when individuals can move to, or recruit in, unobservable sites. methods we used the flexibility of multi-event capture-recapture models to estimate dispersal and recruitment to unobservable sites, merging observations made at two sites within the same breeding locations. we illustrated the model with data on little penguin (eudyptula minor) breeding in artificial as well as in natural nests. natural nests are unknown or inaccessible and birds in these sites remain unobservable. encounters at beaches surrounding the colony suggested that marked animals can permanently move to unobservable nests. we built the multi-event model considering two possible states of the individuals (alive breeding in a nest box and alive in a natural nest) and three types of observations (encountered at a nest only, encountered at the beach only and encountered at both places). this model ensured that the breeding dispersal to unobservable places became estimable. key results results indicate that the estimated survival was 8% higher than when recaptures at artificial nests were analysed alone. also, fidelity to artificial nests was 12% lower than to natural nests. this might reflect the greater availability of natural sites or, alternatively, a heterogeneity between these two types of nest. conclusions we obtained an estimate of local survival of little penguins breeding at penguin island that incorporates the permanent migration to unobservable sites and found an asymmetric dispersion towards natural nests. implication our conclusions suggest a need for more careful treatment of data derived from artificial sites alone, as demographic parameters might be underestimated if animals prefer natural breeding sites or if they are in greater proportion compared with artificial ones. the analytical approach presented can be applied to many biological systems, when animals might move into inaccessible or unobservable breeding sites."
an experimental evaluation of electrofishing catchability and catch depletion abundance estimates of larval lampreys in a wadeable stream: use of a hierarchical approach,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HARRIS JE;JOLLEY JC;SILVER GS;YUEN H;WHITESEL TA,"some lamprey species are in decline, and assessments of local abundance could benefit research and conservation. in wadeable streams, larval lampreys are collected by using specialized backpack electrofishing techniques, although catchability has not been sufficiently evaluated. we assessed removal models for estimating the local abundance of larval lampreys in experimental net-pen enclosures within a wadeable stream. known numbers of larvae were seeded at densities of 4-130 larvae/m(2) into 1-m(2) enclosures that were lined with fine sand and placed into cedar creek, washington (columbia river basin). depletion sampling in each enclosure (n = 69) was conducted by three to five electrofishing passes, and abundance was estimated by six removal models that assumed different catchability functions. catchability averaged 0.28. for the standard removal model, which assumed that catchability varied independently by enclosure but not by pass, the 95% highest posterior density credible intervals (95% hpd-cis) were very large relative to the abundance estimates. models assuming that catchability was either equal or a random factor among all enclosures and passes generally produced accurate (mean bias = -0.04) estimates of abundance, and 95% hpd-cis were much smaller. based on our data set, the expected bias of abundance estimates for 80% of simulations was less than 20% if five passes were completed from at least four randomly selected quadrats and if catchability was assumed to be a random factor. additional sampling may be needed at low lamprey densities (especially <4 larvae/m(2)). our results suggest that local abundance of larval lampreys in wadeable streams can be effectively estimated by depletion sampling at multiple 1-m(2) quadrats and by use of a hierarchical removal model."
seasonal mortality and movement patterns of white bass in a southeastern us reservoir,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,LINCOLN KJ;ADAY DD;RICE JA,"little is known about the fundamental aspects of the life history, ecology, and population dynamics of white bass morone chrysops in southern u.s. reservoirs, making management of this species difficult. recent concerns from the north carolina wildlife resources commission regarding potential population declines in north carolina prompted an effort to expand the knowledge base of white bass in reservoirs. our study aimed to address mortality (fishing mortality, f, and natural mortality, m) as one potential mechanism related to their population declines and to assess seasonal movement and habitat patterns of reservoir white bass throughout the year using telemetry. we implanted acoustic transmitters into 50 white bass in spring 2012 and into 25 white bass in spring 2013. b. everett jordan reservoir, a relatively shallow and eutrophic reservoir located in the piedmont region of north carolina, was separated into four different subbasins that were surveyed each month for tagged fish. fish were monitored using an array of passive receivers and monthly active tracking surveys. a monthly capture history was used as the input for a multistate capture-recapture model in a bayesian framework to estimate instantaneous monthly mortality rates. total annual mortality was 76%. the annual exploitation rate (60%) was greater than the natural mortality rate (15%); however, both f and m exhibited seasonal variation and peaked during spring months in 2012 and 2013. white bass did not use any specific habitat type but were located relatively far from shore and in deep water during cooler months. the use of subbasins in the system was not equal; other than during the spawning run white bass concentrated in several areas within the two deepest subbasins of the reservoir. overall, the high f observed in the spring suggests that adjusting the current liberal harvest limits will help mitigate mortality and aid in the management of reservoir white bass populations."
complex demographic responses of a common small mammal to a plant invasion,eragrostis lehmanniana; grasslands; habitat quality; life-history strategy; non-native plants; sigmodon arizonae,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,LITT AR;STEIDL RJ,"context invasions by non-native plants can alter the abundance and distribution of resources that can affect habitat quality for native animals. aims we sought to understand the demographic consequences of a plant invasion on a functionally and numerically important rodent in a grassland ecosystem. specifically, we evaluated how abundance, survival, reproductive activity and population structure of arizona cotton rats (sigmodon arizonae) varied across a gradient of invasion by eragrostis lehmanniana (lehmann lovegrass), a bunchgrass native to africa that has invaded grasslands in north america. methods over a four-year period, we used capture-recapture methods to survey small mammals on 54 1-ha plots between 10 and 13 times. we used vegetation data collected each autumn to quantify biomass of non-native grass, total biomass and vegetation heterogeneity to characterise vegetation structure on each plot. key results we captured 1344 individual cotton rats during 106560 trap-nights across all sampling periods. in areas dominated by non-native grass, abundance of cotton rats increased 7- to 10-fold and survival increased by 117% relative to areas dominated by native grasses. in contrast, reproductive activity of adults decreased by 62% for females and 28% for males, and the proportion of adults in the population decreased by 20% in these same areas. conclusions demography of arizona cotton rats differed markedly in areas invaded by a non-native plant relative to native grasslands, supporting the long-held idea that life histories can reflect local environmental conditions. because distributions of many non-native plants are predicted to increase in response to future changes in natural and anthropogenic drivers, the potential breadth of these complex effects on communities of native animal is immense. implications the complex variation in demographic responses across the invasion gradient suggests that it may be necessary to evaluate a suite of vital rates to fully understand the consequences of plant invasions on animals. this is especially important for species of conservation concern because single demographic parameters, which are used frequently as targets to gauge the success of conservation and management activities, could be misleading."
space use by female agile antechinus: are teat number and home-range size linked?,food abundance; habitat composition; nest sites; radio-tracking,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,BECKMAN J;LILL A,"context the number of teats that a female agile antechinus (antechinus agilis) possesses effectively determines her initial litter size. in the otway ranges, south-eastern australia, numerous separate populations in which all females have either six or 10 teats occur fairly close together in similar, contiguous forest at comparable altitudes and latitudes. six-teat and 10-teat females have a similar mean mass, but the latter have a 1.7xgreater reproductive potential and so should have a greater nutritional requirement while raising young than do six-teat females. theoretically, they could meet this requirement by occupying larger and/or more exclusive home ranges during breeding than do six-teat females do (provided that their food-resource abundance is comparable), albeit at a greater energetic cost. aims the aim of the study was to determine whether 10-teat a. agilis females occupied larger and less overlapping home ranges than did six-teat females. to interpret the findings more meaningfully, it was necessary to compare food abundance and habitat characteristics in areas occupied by the two phenotypes. methods the investigation was conducted in six-teat and 10-teat a. agilis areas in cool temperate forest over 22 months. population density was determined by mark-recapture methods and arthropod prey biomass and abundance by pitfall trapping. vegetation structure and plant-taxa abundance and diversity were determined by standard plant-survey methods. female home-range estimates determined by radio-tracking were based on 95% minimal convex polygons (mcp) and kernel analysis. home-range overlap was based on 80% mcp range determinations and core areas were calculated from utilisation plots. key results female population density was 2.5xlower in exclusively 10-teat than in exclusively six-teat populations. radio-tracked 10-teat females' home ranges less commonly overlapped those of identified female neighbours and, on average, were 1.5xlarger than ranges of six-teat females. food abundance and composition was similar in six-teat and 10-teat areas, but ground cover was denser and more complex in the latter areas. conclusions food-resource availability was similar in the six-teat and 10-teat phenotype areas, so the larger, and probably more exclusive, home ranges of 10-teat females could reflect greater nutritional requirements resulting from having larger litters, and account for their lower population density. implications the a. agilis teat-number variation pattern in the otways may be a rare, visible example of ongoing incipient speciation. this makes it of great scientific and conservation value and it is important to document how the phenomenon operates."
"quantifying recruitment compensation in florida largemouth bass, with implications for fisheries",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,SHAW SL;ALLEN MS,"fish populations that undergo heavy exploitation and those for which the act of fishing can influence individual brood success are at risk of recruitment effects due to angling. the angling of brood-guarding male black bass micropterus spp. has been shown to decrease brood success, although there is no evidence that a loss of individual broods has population-level impacts. therefore, some level of recruitment compensation may influence juvenile bass survival. we sought to measure recruitment compensation and the form of the stock-recruit relationship for a brood-guarding species, the florida largemouth bass m. salmoides floridanus ( hereafter, florida bass). the study was conducted in four north-central florida lakes during 4 years ( 2010-2013). we quantified adult stock density by using mark-recapture electrofishing surveys. the estimated broods produced in each spawning season, the number of those broods that were successful, and the age-1 recruit density were quantified via snorkel surveys. we evaluated three models for describing the effects of stock density or successful brood density on recruitment: a proportional ( linear; i.e., no compensation) model, a ricker ( dome-shaped) model, and a beverton-holt ( asymptotic) model. recruit density was better indicated by the number of successful broods produced than by spawning stock density. model comparisons indicated that the density-dependent models had the most support, whereas there was no apparent support for the proportional or density-independent model. the ricker model had the most empirical support overall ( estimated parameters: a = 2.2, b = 0.009). our results indicate that the number of successful broods would have to fall below about 5 broods/ha to generate direct declines in observed average recruitment of florida bass."
"brown hyaena population explosion: rapid population growth in a small, fenced system",camera survey; density estimates; enclosed reserve; fences; hyaena brunnea,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,WELCH RJ;PARKER DM,"context. in the past 200 years, many carnivores have experienced a widespread decline in numbers and range reductions. conservation interventions include the use of small, fenced reserves that have potential restoration benefits for conservation. over the past 25 years, the eastern cape province of south africa has seen the establishment of many small (<= 440 km(2)) game reserves, and the reintroduction of the larger, indigenous wildlife that had been extirpated by the early 20th century, including brown hyaenas (hyaena brunnea). these game reserves have restored the environment to a more natural state but little information exists concerning the benefits and implications of introducing elusive animals that are seldom seen after reintroduction. fenced reserves have the potential to provide surplus animals that can be relocated for restoration purposes (where applicable) or serve as a buffer to the extinction of naturally occurring populations, but careful management is required to monitor populations appropriately, so as to avoid the costs of rapid population increase. aims. the reintroduction of brown hyaenas to the eastern cape has provided a case study to assess the role of small reserves and their potential to contribute to conservation, by determining the persistence and population growth of brown hyaenas in a small, enclosed reserve. methods. estimates of brown hyaena density were calculated using a capture-recapture approach from individually identifiable images captured during a 3-month camera trapping survey. key results. after a single decade, the brown hyaena population increased by at least 367%, from six individuals to a minimum of 28 individuals. these results suggest that this brown hyaena population has the highest density ever recorded for the species in southern africa. conclusions and implications. because brown hyaena populations were high relative to natural unfenced populations, high fences may provide two utilities for their conservation. fenced reserves may provide surplus animals to support reintroductions and provide protected populations to buffer the risk of species extinction."
estimating riverwide abundance of juvenile fish populations: how much sampling is enough?,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,KORMAN J;SCHICK J;MOSSOP B,"estimating riverwide abundance of juvenile fish populations is challenging because detection probability is typically low and juveniles can be patchily distributed over large areas. we used a hierarchical bayesian model to estimate the abundance of juvenile steelhead oncorhynchus mykiss in two rivers in british columbia over 3 years based on a multigear, two-phase sampling design. these estimates were used to drive a simulation model to evaluate how the precision of abundance estimates varied with the number of single-pass index and mark-recapture sites that were sampled, the proportion of shoreline sampled, and the mean and variation of detection probability and fish density across sites. the extent of variation in fish densities across index sites was the most important factor influencing the precision of river-wide abundance estimates, and increasing the number of index sites was the best approach to reduce variability in abundance estimates. river size, which controls the proportion of habitat sampled for a given level of sampling effort, had a moderate effect on precision, but only when the extent of site-to-site variation in fish density was high. factors affecting detection probability, such as the number of mark-recapture sites, the mean detection probability, or the extent of variation in detection probability across sites, had much less influence on precision of abundance estimates unless the proportion of river sampled was high. hierarchical bayesian models are no substitute for collecting informative data, but they improve our understanding of variance structure, which is critical for providing realistic estimates of uncertainty and designing informative and efficient sampling programs."
developing recreational harvest regulations for an unexploited lake trout population,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,LENKER MA;WEIDEL BC;JENSEN OP;SOLOMON CT,"developing fishing regulations for previously unexploited populations presents numerous challenges, many of which stem from a scarcity of baseline information about abundance, population productivity, and expected angling pressure. we used simulation models to test the effect of six management strategies (catch and release; trophy, minimum, and maximum length limits; and protected and exploited slot length limits) on an unexploited population of lake trout salvelinus namaycush in follensby pond, a 393-ha lake located in new york state's adirondack park. we combined field and literature data and mark-recapture abundance estimates to parameterize an agestructured population model and used the model to assess the effects of each management strategy on abundance, catch per unit effort (cpue), and harvest over a range of angler effort (0-2,000 angler-days/year). lake trout density (3.5 fish/ha for fish >= age 13, the estimated age at maturity) was similar to densities observed in other unexploited systems, but growth rate was relatively slow. maximum harvest occurred at levels of effort <= 1,000 angler-days/year in all the scenarios considered. regulations that permitted harvest of large postmaturation fish, such as new york's standard lake trout minimum size limit or a trophy size limit, resulted in low harvest and high angler cpue. regulations that permitted harvest of small and sometimes immature fish, such as a protected slot or maximum size limit, allowed high harvest but resulted in low angler cpue and produced rapid declines in harvest with increases in effort beyond the effort consistent with maximum yield. management agencies can use these results to match regulations to management goals and to assess the risks of different management options for unexploited lake trout populations and other fish species with similar life history traits."
overdispersion in the estimation of salmon escapements by mark-recapture surveys and its related factors,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,MIYAKOSHI Y;KITADA S,"the petersen method, a well-known mark-recapture method, is frequently used in the estimation of escapement of pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp. robust estimates and associated variances can be obtained when the underlying assumptions of this method are met. however, in field surveys, it is often difficult to meet these assumptions because wild animals are often not randomly distributed. when the sampling variance of the estimator exceeds its binomial variance (resulting in overdispersion), the petersen model underestimates variance. we assessed the occurrence of overdispersion in the mark-recapture data collected to estimate the escapements of masu salmon oncorhynchus masou in a river in northern japan in 1998 and 1999. the dispersion parameters estimated from 2-year data were 2.89 and 2.51 for males and 1.45 and 1.52 for females, indicating that overdispersion occurred in all cases. the magnitude of overdispersion for males exceeded that for females, probably related to differences in the postspawning behaviors of the sexes, as represented by the changes of the sex ratio of masu salmon recovered on the spawning grounds. in this paper, we propose a simple procedure to detect the occurrence of overdispersion in multiple-recovery mark-recapture data."
status and habitat use of scaphirhynchus sturgeons in an important fluvial corridor: implications for river habitat enhancement,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HINTZ WD;GLOVER DC;GARVEY JE;KILLGORE KJ;HERZOG DP;SPIER TW;COLOMBO RE;HRABIK RA,"in the central united states, recovery efforts for populations of the federally endangered pallid sturgeon scaphirhynchus albus have been ongoing since its listing in 1990. its congener, the shovelnose sturgeon s. platorynchus, has also recently been listed as threatened where it overlaps with pallid sturgeon. the status of both species in the mississippi river is unknown and so are habitat enhancement priorities that would benefit their recovery. using field data collected from 2002 through 2005, we (1) estimated the adult population size of both species using mark-recapture methods and (2) quantified habitat use of these sturgeons with multiple gears to elucidate habitat enhancement priorities in the middle mississippi river-an important fluvial corridor that connects the upper mississippi river and missouri river basins with the lower mississippi river basin. population size was estimated to be 1,516 (95% ci = 710-3,463) pallid sturgeon (five individuals per river kilometer [rkm]) and 82,336 (95% ci = 59,438-114,585) shovelnose sturgeon (266 individuals/rkm). our population estimate showed a low relative abundance of pallid sturgeon in this corridor. however, the population estimate suggests pallid sturgeon abundance has increased since its listing in 1990. shovelnose sturgeon were more abundant than pallid sturgeon, but whether the shovelnose sturgeon population is increasing, decreasing, or stable remains unknown. among 10 habitat types, both species were most frequent at the downstream ends of alluvial islands. pallid and shovelnose sturgeons were restricted to flow rates < 1.0 m/s, and their abundance was greatest in depths ranging from 4.5 to 14 m. we suggest alluvial island enhancement may facilitate sturgeon recovery in the middle mississippi river."
robust and defensible mark-recapture methodologies for salmonid escapement: modernizing the use of data and resources,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,VELEZ ESPINO LA;IRVINE JR;WINTHER I;DUNLOP R;MULLINS G;SINGER K;TROUTON N,"estimates of population size, required for most ecological investigations, are often achieved by mark-recapture experiments, frequently by applying pooled or stratified petersen estimators. unfortunately, the closure assumption required by petersen estimators is frequently violated in the estimation of salmonid escapement, even though the consequences of this violation have been known for decades. we illustrate how biologists and analysts can and should make better use of statistical, mathematical, and computational advances in their analysis of mark-recapture data. modern, easily applied approaches address and minimize the effects of violations to the model assumptions on which abundance estimators are based. using examples from research estimating the numbers of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha escaping fisheries to spawn, this study demonstrates and provides evidence in support of the use of a robust and defensible approach to salmonid escapement estimation based on the analysis of individual encounter histories. the main attributes of the approach include (1) testing for demographic closure, (2) allowing different hypotheses about the demographic attributes and capture history of the studied population to be expressed within a model selection framework, encompassing suites of open-or closed-population approaches, and (3) optimizing the use of information by embracing the opportunities that mark-recapture experiments generate to increase our knowledge of salmonid ecology and hence improve both future study designs and management decisions. this study also demonstrates that discrepancies (positive) in abundance estimates produced with the petersen estimator relative to those produced by the ""best models"" from robust estimators are inversely proportional to sampling rates."
spawning site fidelity of wild and hatchery lake trout (salvelinus namaycush) in northern lake huron,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,BINDER TR;RILEY SC;HOLBROOK CM;HANSEN MJ;BERGSTEDT RA;BRONTE CR;HE J;KRUEGER CC,"fidelity to high-quality spawning sites helps ensure that adults repeatedly spawn at sites that maximize reproductive success. fidelity is also an important behavioural characteristic to consider when hatchery-reared individuals are stocked for species restoration, because artificial rearing environments may interfere with cues that guide appropriate spawning site selection. acoustic telemetry was used in conjunction with cormack-jolly-seber capture-recapture models to compare degree of spawning site fidelity of wild and hatchery-reared lake trout (salvelinus namaycush) in northern lake huron. annual survival was estimated to be between 77% and 81% and did not differ among wild and hatchery males and females. site fidelity estimates were high in both wild and hatchery-reared lake trout (ranging from 0.78 to 0.94, depending on group and time filter), but were slightly lower in hatchery-reared fish than in wild fish. the ecological implication of the small difference in site fidelity between wild and hatchery-reared lake trout is unclear, but similarities in estimates suggest that many hatchery-reared fish use similar spawning sites to wild fish and that most return to those sites annually for spawning."
"seasonal and spatial patterns of growth of rainbow trout in the colorado river in grand canyon, arizona",NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,YARD MD;KORMAN J;WALTERS CJ;KENNEDY TA,"rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) have been purposely introduced in many regulated rivers, with inadvertent consequences on native fishes. we describe how trout growth rates and condition could be influencing trout population dynamics in a 130 km section of the colorado river below glen canyon dam based on a large-scale mark-recapture program where similar to 8000 rainbow trout were recaptured over a 3-year period (2012-2014). there were strong temporal and spatial variations in growth in both length and weight as predicted from von bertalanffy and bioenergetic models, respectively. there was more evidence for seasonal variation in the growth coefficient and annual variation in the asymptotic length. bioenergetic models showed more variability for growth in weight across seasons and years than across reaches. these patterns were consistent with strong seasonal variation in invertebrate drift and effects of turbidity on foraging efficiency. highest growth rates and relative condition occurred in downstream reaches with lower trout densities. results indicate that reduction in rainbow trout abundance in glen canyon will likely increase trout size in the tailwater fishery and may reduce downstream dispersal into grand canyon."

demystifying the sundarban tiger: novel application of conventional population estimation methods in a unique ecosystem,baited traps; capture-mark-recapture; carnivore carrying capacity; mangrove; prey density; spatially explicit tiger density,POPULATION ECOLOGY,ROY M;QURESHI Q;NAHA D;SANKAR K;GOPAL R;JHALA YV,"conserving large populations with unique adaptations is essential for minimizing extinction risks. sundarban mangroves (> 10,000 km(2)) are the only mangrove inhabited by tigers. baseline information about this tiger population is lacking due to its man-eating reputation and logistic difficulties of sampling. herein, we adapt photographic capture-mark-recapture (cmr) and distance sampling to estimate tiger and prey densities. we placed baited camera stations in a typical mangrove in 2010 and 2012. we used telemetry based tiger home-range radius (5.73 km, se 0.72 km) to estimate effective trapping area (eta). an effort of 407 and 1073 trap nights were exerted to photocapture 10 and 22 unique tigers in 2010 and 2012. we accounted for use of bait by modelling behaviour and heterogeneity effects in program mark and secr package in program r. using traditional cmr, tiger number was estimated at 11 (se 2) and density at 4.07 (se range 3.09-5.17) in 2010 while in 2012, tiger number was 24 (se 3) and density 4.63 (se range 3.92-5.40) tigers/100 km(2). with likelihood based spatially explicit cmr, tiger densities were estimated at 4.08 (se 1.51) in 2010 and 5.81 (se 1.24) tigers/100 km(2) in 2012. using distance sampling along water channels, we estimated chital density at 5.24/km(2), se 1.23 which could potentially support 4.68 tigers/100 km(2) [95 % ci (3.92, 5.57)]. our estimates suggest that sundarban tiger population is one of the largest in the world and therefore merits high conservation status."
estimates of small indian mongoose densities: implications for rabies management,capture-mark-recapture; herpestes auropunctatus; minimum number known alive; mongoose; population density; puerto rico; rabies; spatially explicit capture-recapture,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,JOHNSON SR;BERENTSEN AR;ELLIS C;DAVIS A;VERCAUTEREN KC,"the small indian mongoose (herpestes auropunctatus) is an invasive species and rabies reservoir in puerto rico. in the continental united states, terrestrial wildlife rabies is primarily managed by the national rabies management program (nrmp) of the united states department of agriculture through oral rabies vaccination (orv); the distribution of the vaccine baits is influenced by the population density of the target species. the nrmp uses a density index for estimating raccoon (procyon lotor) population density to guide bait distribution. in puerto rico, a wildlife rabies vaccination program does not exist and vaccination of domestic animals is limited and not compulsory. to acquire information on density and other population dynamics, we compared a mongoose density index (mdi) adapted from the nrmp raccoon density index (rdi) to 3 other methods (2 types of capture-mark-recapture [capture and mark] and spatially explicit capture-recapture [secr]) for estimating density that incorporate modeling procedures on detection probabilities, and examined the spatial distribution of mongooses within our study plots. we used the rdi trapping protocol modified for mongooses to livetrap mongooses in el yunque national forest (el yunque) and cabo rojo national wildlife refuge (cabo rojo) in fall of 2011 and spring of 2012 resulting in 4 trapping sessions. the mdi estimates were consistently less than those from other methods for estimating mongoose densities. the mdi detected a greater mongoose density during the wet season (0.55mongooses/ha) than the dry season (0.34mongooses/ha) at cabo rojo, consistent with all 3 other density estimation methods. overall, the correlation coefficient between mdi and the other calculation methods was 0.68. when we examined known locations of mongooses and travel distances, we detected more mongooses in a smaller area within the study plot at cabo rojo than at el yunque. the mdi provided information on the spatial distribution of mongooses, which will be needed to implement an orv program to target mongooses in puerto rico. published 2015. this article is a u.s. government work and is in the public domain in the usa."
factors influencing emigration of ross's and snow geese from an arctic breeding area,abundance; arctic; emigration; fidelity; light geese; nest success,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,WILSON S;ALISAUSKAS RT;KELLETT DK,"emigration is one of the most difficult demographic rates to estimate, yet understanding movement among populations has important consequences for wildlife conservation. we studied factors that affected emigration by adult ross's geese (chen rossii) and lesser snow geese (c. caerulescens caerulescens) during a demographic study from 1997 to 2013 of nesting geese at the karrak lake colony south of queen maud gulf in the central canadian arctic. rising abundance of both species in recent decades has led to concerns about their impacts on arctic ecosystems. we used burnham's model to estimate true survival and fidelity (i.e., the complement of emigration). mean estimates of fidelity were higher for ross's geese (male=0.91 +/- 0.02, female=0.95 +/- 0.01) than for snow geese (male=0.76 +/- 0.02, female=0.90 +/- 0.02). fidelity declined with prior nesting season abundance in both species with evidence that a reduction in population size led to greater fidelity in the following year. fidelity was positively influenced by mean nest success in the previous year with similar responses by both species. however, years of low nest success were more frequent for snow geese resulting in higher emigration. we expected that deeper snow before nesting would motivate greater emigration but found the opposite effect in both species, suggesting that individuals may be discouraged from dispersing in snow-covered landscapes. we also tested whether a large decline in the number of snow geese nesting at karrak lake in 2007-2008 was related to a mass emigration event but found no evidence for a change in fidelity in these years. moreover, survival of both species showed an increasing trend from 1997 to 2013 so the decline in nesting snow geese likely was an outcome of temporary non-breeding, rather than emigration or death. the destination of emigrants remains unknown, but we expect this movement has broader consequences for metapopulation dynamics of light geese across the central arctic.

what shapes fitness costs of reproduction in long-lived iteroparous species? a case study on the alpine ibex,alpine ibex; capra ibex; french alps; individual quality; large herbivores; mixture models; multi-event capture-recapture models; reproductive tactics; trade-offs; vanoise national park; savoie; france,ECOLOGY,GARNIER A;GAILLARD JM;GAUTHIER D;BESNARD A,"the fitness costs of reproduction can be masked by individual differences, and may only become apparent during adverse environmental conditions. individual differences, however, are usually assessed by reproductive success, so how fitness costs are influenced by the interplay between the environmental context and overall individual differences requires further investigation. here, we evaluated fitness costs of reproduction based on 15yr of monitoring of individual alpine ibex (capra ibex) during a period when the population was affected by a severe disease outbreak (pneumonia). we quantified fitness costs using a novel multi-event capture-mark-recapture (cmr) modeling approach that accounted for uncertainty in reproductive status to estimate the survival and reproductive success of female ibex while also accounting for overall individual heterogeneity using mixture models. our results show that the ability of females to reproduce was highly heterogeneous. in particular, one group including 76% of females had a much higher probability of giving birth annually (between 0.66 and 0.77, depending on the previous reproductive status) than females of the second group (24% of females, between 0 and 0.05 probability of giving birth annually). low reproductive costs in terms of future reproduction occurred and were independent of the pneumonia outbreak. there was no survival cost of reproduction either before or after the epizootic, but the cost was high during the epizootic. our findings indicate that adverse environmental conditions, such as disease outbreaks, may lead to survival costs of reproduction in long-lived species and select against females that have a high reproductive effort. thereby, the occurrence of adverse conditions increases the diversity of reproductive tactics within a population."
"migration, growth patterns, and diet of pike (esox lucius) in a river reservoir and its inflowing river",river fragmentation; predation; habitat utilization; habitat modification; northern pike,FISHERIES RESEARCH,SANDLUND OT;MUSETH J;OISTAD S,"the pike population in the lopsjoen reservoir and the accessible 21 km section of the inflowing river rena was investigated from 2003 to 2013. telemetry and mark-recapture with floy tags demonstrated that most fish had an annual home range of less than 2 km, while some fish performed quite extensive migrations (up to 14.4 km). of fish radio-tagged in the reservoir, 57% were positioned in the river at least once. the population of pike >= 25 cm was estimated at 1002 fish, or 3.9 fish (3.17 kg) ha(-1). mean length at age was significantly larger for pike caught in the river than in the reservoir for almost all age groups. cpue during boat electro-fishing indicated significantly lower population densities and a lower proportion of juvenile fish in the river than in the reservoir. diet analysis revealed that almost all available prey fish species were taken by pike, and that there was a clear diet differentiation between pike size classes, and between fish from the river and reservoir habitats. small pike (<25 cm) in the reservoir had eaten mainly invertebrates, whereas smaller pike and alpine bullhead (cottus poecilopus) dominated in small pike from the river. nine prey fish species were identified in the stomachs of medium sized pike (25-50 cm) in the reservoir, with brook lamprey (lampetra planer and brown trout (salmo trutta) as dominant. medium sized pike in the river had taken mainly lamprey and alpine bullhead. larger pike (>50 cm) in the reservoir had taken brown trout as well as a number of other prey fish, while river pike of this size had taken burbot (lota iota), lamprey and brown trout. species like perch (perca fluviatilis), roach (rutilus rutilus) and in particular grayling (thymallus thymallus) were rarely found in pike stomachs. the construction of the reservoir in a fast-flowing river caused the establishment of a healthy pike population and additional predation pressure on the rheophilic salmonids in the system, both in the reservoir and in the inflowing river.

spatial capture-recapture models allowing markovian transience or dispersal,animal movement; density estimation; dispersal; spatial capture-recapture; spatially explicit capture-recapture; transience,POPULATION ECOLOGY,ROYLE JA;FULLER AK;SUTHERLAND C,"spatial capture-recapture (scr) models are a relatively recent development in quantitative ecology, and they are becoming widely used to model density in studies of animal populations using camera traps, dna sampling and other methods which produce spatially explicit individual encounter information. one of the core assumptions of scr models is that individuals possess home ranges that are spatially stationary during the sampling period. for many species, this assumption is unlikely to be met and, even for species that are typically territorial, individuals may disperse or exhibit transience at some life stages. in this paper we first conduct a simulation study to evaluate the robustness of estimators of density under ordinary scr models when dispersal or transience is present in the population. then, using both simulated and real data, we demonstrate that such models can easily be described in the bugs language providing a practical framework for their analysis, which allows us to evaluate movement dynamics of species using capture-recapture data. we find that while estimators of density are extremely robust, even to pathological levels of movement (e.g., complete transience), the estimator of the spatial scale parameter of the encounter probability model is confounded with the dispersal/transience scale parameter. thus, use of ordinary scr models to make inferences about density is feasible, but interpretation of scr model parameters in relation to movement should be avoided. instead, when movement dynamics are of interest, such dynamics should be parameterized explicitly in the model."
comparison of visual survey and mark-recapture population estimates of a benthic fish in hawaii,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HAIN EF;LAMPHERE BA;BLUM MJ;MCINTYRE PB;NELSON SAC;GILLIAM JF,"visual surveys are conducted to rapidly estimate population densities of stream fishes, often without calibration against more established or more widely used methods to determine precision and accuracy or to correct for potential biases. we compared population density estimates from a visual survey (vs) point quadrat method widely used in hawaii with estimates from ""in hand"" individual and batch mark-recapture (bmr) methods. visual survey sampling and individual mark-recapture (imr) sampling were conducted in three watersheds that represent gradients of land use and prevalence of nonnative poeciliid fishes on the island of hawaii. focusing on adult o'opu nakea awaous stamineus, vss were conducted prior to imr events to allow direct comparisons of results independent of location and time. density estimates of o'opu nakea from vs and imr samplings were strongly correlated, although vs estimates were generally higher and underrepresented exceptionally large fish. batch mark-recapture estimates of o'opu nakea densities were conducted for comparison with vss at 13 sites across the archipelago. estimates of vss were not significantly different from bmr estimates. estimates of vss also exhibited less variance than did bmr estimates across sites. general linear models showed that the relationship between vs and imr estimates varied significantly among watersheds but not seasons and that land use was associated with a greater mismatch between vs and bmr estimates of population density. these findings indicate that visual surveys using a point quadrat method are an efficient and accurate approach for estimating the abundance of small benthic fishes, such as o'opu nakea, in wadeable streams and that obtaining absolute densities or size distributions from vs methods would benefit from a calibration with imr not bmr estimates."
pronounced genetic structure and site fidelity among native muskellunge populations in lake huron and georgian bay,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,WILSON CC;LISKAUSKAS AP;WOZNEY KM,"conservation and management issues related to genetic diversity and stock structure of native populations of muskellunge esox masquinongy have largely been unexplored. in lake huron's north channel and georgian bay, muskellunge populations have been impacted by historical commercial fisheries, recreational fisheries, loss of spawning habitat, historical water quality issues, and ecosystem changes. to determine the spatial genetic structure of native muskellunge in lake huron and georgian bay, spawning adults were sampled from 10 sites in the north channel and eastern georgian bay. genotyping with 20 microsatellite dna loci showed substantial spatial genetic structure, with significant pairwise divergences among spawning sites. individual-and population-based analyses revealed hierarchical population structuring, with strong patterns of spawning site fidelity and isolation by distance; very low levels of dispersal and gene flow over historical and contemporary timescales were indicated. estimation of effective population sizes highlighted the limited genetic resources that are present in these localized populations. the present results show that muskellunge in lake huron and georgian bay consist of multiple small populations with limited ranges and high site fidelity and should be managed accordingly."
population dynamics of feral horses (equus caballus) in an exotic coniferous plantation in australia,invasive species; fertility; mark-recapture; population ecology; population dynamics; population growth; population management; population modelling; survival; reproduction,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,ZABEK MA;BERMAN DM;BLOMBERG SP;COLLINS CW;WRIGHT J,"context understanding population dynamics of invasive species is crucial for the development of management strategies. feral horses (equus caballus) are a growing problem in the tuan-toolara state forest (ttsf), a coniferous plantation in south-eastern queensland, australia. aim the population dynamics of the ttsf feral horses was not known. therefore, the study was designed to characterise the major vital parameters of this population and, using these data, develop a long-term management plan. methods the study was conducted over 3 years (2011-14) involving 522 individually identified horses. foaling rates were used to calculate fecundity. body fat distribution was estimated using body condition score (bcs), which reflects the nutritional, metabolic and general health of individual animals. multi state mark-capture population models were used to estimate age-specific survival, and the leslie age-structured projection matrix model was used to determine the annual rate at which the population increased. key results the mean annual fecundity was low (0.230.07s.d.). the mean bcs of the population was mid-range (2.550.51s.d.) with adult females having lower scores than other age and gender groups. survival estimates were consistently high (0.92-0.95) across all age groups. the average annual finite rate of population increase () for the 3 years of the study was 1.09. sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the population growth rate was almost seven times more sensitive to changes in adult survival compared with juvenile survival, and almost twice as sensitive to changes in fecundity. key conclusions population dynamics of the ttsf feral horses were comparable to other feral horse populations similarly challenged by environmental nutritional limitations. implications defining population dynamics of the ttsf feral horses permits the formulation of management goals that can be audited and adapted as required. the most effective strategy for controlling population growth in the ttsf would involve the continuing removal of substantial numbers of adult females or manipulation of survival and/or fecundity. as selective removal will likely alter the adult sex ratio and age structure of the population, ongoing assessment is necessary to minimise adverse welfare outcomes."
analysis on population level reveals trappability of wild rodents is determined by previous trap occupant,NA,PLOS ONE,BROUARD MJ;COULSON T;NEWMAN C;MACDONALD DW;BUESCHING CD,"live trapping is central to the study of small mammals. thus, any bias needs to be understood and accounted for in subsequent analyses to ensure accurate population estimates. one rarely considered bias is the behavioural response of individuals to the trap, in particular the olfactory cues left behind by previous occupants (po). we used a data set of 8,115 trap nights spanning 17 separate trapping sessions between august 2002 and november 2013 in wytham woods, oxfordshire, uk to examine if the decision to enter a trap was affected by the po, if this was detectable in traditional capture-mark-recapture trapping data (i.e., individuals not uniquely marked), and if it was possible for this effect to bias the population estimates obtained. data were collected on apodemus sylvaticus, myodes glareolus, and microtus agrestis. three generalised linear models revealed a significant tendency for the three species to enter traps with same-species po. with, for example, a. sylvaticus 9.1 times more likely to enter a same species po trap compared to one that contained a m. agrestis in the grassland during the nocturnal period. simulation highlighted that, when all other factors are equal, the species with the highest po effect will have the highest capture rate and therefore return more accurate population estimates. despite the large dataset, certain species-, sex-, and/or age-combinations were under-represented, and thus no effects of any additional individual-specific characteristics could be evaluated. uniquely marking individuals would allow for the po effect to be disentangled from other biases such as trap-shyness and spatial heterogeneity, but may not be possible in all cases and will depend on the aims of the study and the resources available."
dynamics of chytridiomycosis during the breeding season in an australian alpine amphibian,NA,PLOS ONE,BRANNELLY LA;HUNTER DA;LENGER D;SCHEELE BC;SKERRATT LF;BERGER L,"understanding disease dynamics during the breeding season of declining amphibian species will improve our understanding of how remnant populations persist with endemic infection, and will assist the development of management techniques to protect disease-threatened species from extinction. we monitored the endangered litoria verreauxii alpina (alpine treefrog) during the breeding season through capture-mark-recapture (cmr) studies in which we investigated the dynamics of chytridiomycosis in relation to population size in two populations. we found that infection prevalence and intensity increased throughout the breeding season in both populations, but infection prevalence and intensity was higher (3.49 and 2.02 times higher prevalence and intensity, respectively) at the site that had a 90-fold higher population density. this suggests that bd transmission is density-dependent. weekly survival probability was related to disease state, with heavily infected animals having the lowest survival. there was low recovery from infection, especially when animals were heavily infected with bd. sympatric amphibian species are likely to be reservoir hosts for the disease and can play an important role in the disease ecology of bd. although we found 0% prevalence in crayfish (cherax destructor), we found that a sympatric amphibian (crinia signifera) maintained 100% infection prevalence at a high intensity throughout the season. our results demonstrate the importance of including infection intensity into cmr disease analysis in order to fully understand the implications of disease on the amphibian community. we recommend a combined management approach to promote lower population densities and ensure consistent progeny survival. the most effective management strategy to safeguard the persistence of this susceptible species might be to increase habitat area while maintaining a similar sized suitable breeding zone and to increase water flow and area to reduce drought."

maximizing mating opportunities: higher autumn swarming activity in male versus female myotis bats,chiroptera; hibernacula; life history strategy; movements; myotis; population dynamics; sex-specific; swarming,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,BURNS LE;BRODERS HG,"many animal taxa exhibit intersexual differences in sociality and resource selection that can result in variation in energy allocation budgets. asymmetry of reproductive energetics between sexes can lead to intersexual variation in behavior to maximize lifetime reproductive success. temperate bats show marked intersexual differences during summer when sexual segregation occurs. although some intersexual differences have been shown in activities during the autumn mating period, they have not been examined in the context of fitness consequences for each sex. we studied autumn swarming activity of little brown and northern myotis bats (myotis lucifugus and m. septentrionalis) in nova scotia, canada, to test predictions of the hypothesis that intersexual variation in swarming behaviors occurs to maximize fitness. we conducted capture-mark-recapture surveys at swarming sites to characterize the nature and extent of intersexual variation in swarming activities. relative to females, males occurred in disproportionally large numbers; had longer swarming seasons overlapping the female swarming season; and accounted for a disproportionately large number of recaptures at swarming sites suggesting that they had returned more frequently. no movements among swarming sites, which ranged in pairwise distance from 27.9 to 98.9 km, were detected for either species. activity at swarming sites was highest early in the season for both species. as predicted, males engaged more frequently in swarming activities than females which likely reflect males maximizing opportunities for mating. although their activities overlap during this period, differences suggest sex-specific activity budgets and it is likely that for each sex, individuals reconcile energetic constraints differently to maximize fitness."
climate and density influence annual survival and movement in a migratory songbird,american redstart; annual survival; breeding dispersal; density; el nino southern oscillation; multistate mark-recapture; normalized difference vegetation index; setophaga ruticilla,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MCKELLAR AE;REUDINK MW;MARRA PP;RATCLIFFE LM;WILSON S,"assessing the drivers of survival across the annual cycle is important for understanding when and how population limitation occurs in migratory animals. density-dependent population regulation can occur during breeding and non-breeding periods, and large-scale climate cycles can also affect survival throughout the annual cycle via their effects on local weather and vegetation productivity. most studies of survival use mark-recapture techniques to estimate apparent survival, but true survival rates remain obscured due to unknown rates of permanent emigration. this is especially problematic when assessing annual survival of migratory birds, whose movement between breeding attempts, or breeding dispersal, can be substantial. we used a multistate approach to examine drivers of annual survival and one component of breeding dispersal (habitat-specific movements) in a population of american redstarts (setophaga ruticilla) over 11 years in two adjacent habitat types. annual survival displayed a curvilinear relation to the southern oscillation index, with lower survival during la nina and el nino conditions. although redstart density had no impact on survival, habitat-specific density influenced local movements between habitat types, with redstarts being less likely to disperse from their previous year's breeding habitat as density within that habitat increased. this finding was strongest in males and may be explained by conspecific attraction influencing settlement decisions. survival was lowest in young males, but movement was highest in this group, indicating that apparent survival rates were likely biased low due to permanent emigration. our findings demonstrate the utility of examining breeding dispersal in mark-recapture studies and complement recent work using spatially explicit models of dispersal probability to obtain greater accuracy in survival estimates."
age-specific survival and annual variation in survival of female chamois differ between populations,age-specific survival; capture-mark-recapture; environmental variability; rupicapra rupicapra; senescence,OECOLOGIA,BLEU J;HERFINDAL I;LOISON A;KWAK AMG;GAREL M;TOIGO C;REMPFLER T;FILLI F;SAETHER BE,"in many species, population dynamics are shaped by age-structured demographic parameters, such as survival, which can cause age-specific sensitivity to environmental conditions. accordingly, we can expect populations with different age-specific survival to be differently affected by environmental variation. however, this hypothesis is rarely tested at the intra-specific level. using capture-mark-recapture models, we quantified age-specific survival and the extent of annual variations in survival of females of alpine chamois in two sites. in one population, survival was very high (> 0.94; bauges, france) until the onset of senescence at approximately 7 years old, whereas the two other populations (swiss national park, snp) had a later onset (12 years old) and a lower rate of senescence. senescence patterns are therefore not fixed within species. annual variation in survival was higher in the bauges (sd = 0.26) compared to the snp populations (sd = 0.20). also, in each population, the age classes with the lowest survival also experienced the largest temporal variation, in accordance with inter-specific comparisons showing a greater impact of environmental variation on these age classes. the large difference between the populations in age-specific survival and variation suggests that environmental variation and climate change will affect these populations differently."
infection dynamics in frog populations with different histories of decline caused by a deadly disease,coexistence; disease dynamics; fungus; host-pathogen interactions; infectious disease,OECOLOGIA,SAPSFORD SJ;VOORDOUW MJ;ALFORD RA;SCHWARZKOPF L,"pathogens can drive host population dynamics. chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease of amphibians that is caused by the fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd). this pathogen has caused declines and extinctions in some host species whereas other host species coexist with bd without suffering declines. in the early 1990s, bd extirpated populations of the endangered common mistfrog, litoria rheocola, at high-elevation sites, while populations of the species persisted at low-elevation sites. today, populations have reappeared at many high-elevation sites where they presently co-exist with the fungus. we conducted a capture-mark-recapture (cmr) study of six populations of l. rheocola over 1 year, at high and low elevations. we used multistate cmr models to determine which factors (bd infection status, site type, and season) influenced rates of frog survival, recapture, infection, and recovery from infection. we observed bd-induced mortality of individual frogs, but did not find any significant effect of bd infection on the survival rate of l. rheocola at the population level. survival and recapture rates depended on site type and season. infection rate was highest in winter when temperatures were favourable for pathogen growth, and differed among site types. the recovery rate was high (75.7-85.8 %) across seasons, and did not differ among site types. the coexistence of l. rheocola with bd suggests that (1) frog populations are becoming resistant to the fungus, (2) bd may have evolved lower virulence, or (3) current environmental conditions may be inhibiting outbreaks of the fatal disease."
the effect of novel research activities on long-term survival of temporarily captive steller sea lions (eumetopias jubatus),NA,PLOS ONE,SHUERT C;HORNING M;MELLISH JA,"two novel research approaches were developed to facilitate controlled access to, and long-term monitoring of, juvenile steller sea lions for periods longer than typically afforded by traditional fieldwork. the transient juvenile steller sea lion project at the alaska sealife center facilitated nutritional, physiological, and behavioral studies on the platform of temporary captivity. temporarily captive sea lions (tjs, n = 35) were studied, and were intraperitoneally implanted with life history transmitters (lhx tags) to determine causes of mortality post-release. our goal was to evaluate the potential for long-term impacts of temporary captivity and telemetry implants on the survival of study individuals. a simple open-population cormack-jolly-seber mark-recapture model was built in program mark, incorporating resightings of uniquely branded study individuals gathered by several contributing institutions. a priori models were developed to weigh the evidence of effects of experimental treatment on survival with covariates of sex, age, capture age, cohort, and age class. we compared survival of experimental treatment to a control group of n = 27 free-ranging animals (frs) that were sampled during capture events and immediately released. sex has previously been show to differentially affect juvenile survival in steller sea lions. therefore, sex was included in all models to account for unbalanced sex ratios within the experimental group. considerable support was identified for the effects of sex, accounting for over 71% of total weight for all a priori models with delta aicc < 5, and over 91% of model weight after removal of pretending variables. overall, most support was found for the most parsimonious model based on sex and excluding experimental treatment. models including experimental treatment were not supported after post-hoc considerations of model selection criteria. however, given the limited sample size, alternate models including effects of experimental treatments remain possible and effects may yet become apparent in larger sample sizes."
examining temporal sample scale and model choice with spatial capture-recapture models in the common leopard panthera pardus,NA,PLOS ONE,GOLDBERG JF;TEMPA T;NORBU N;HEBBLEWHITE M;MILLS LS;WANGCHUK TR;LUKACS P,"many large carnivores occupy a wide geographic distribution, and face threats from habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, prey depletion, and human wildlife-conflicts. conservation requires robust techniques for estimating population densities and trends, but the elusive nature and low densities of many large carnivores make them difficult to detect. spatial capture-recapture (scr) models provide a means for handling imperfect detectability, while linking population estimates to individual movement patterns to provide more accurate estimates than standard approaches. within this framework, we investigate the effect of different sample interval lengths on density estimates, using simulations and a common leopard (panthera pardus) model system. we apply bayesian scr methods to 89 simulated datasets and camera-trapping data from 22 leopards captured 82 times during winter 20102011 in royal manas national park, bhutan. we show that sample interval length from daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly periods did not appreciably affect median abundance or density, but did influence precision. we observed the largest gains in precision when moving from quarterly to shorter intervals. we therefore recommend daily sampling intervals for monitoring rare or elusive species where practicable, but note that monthly or quarterly sample periods can have similar informative value. we further develop a novel application of bayes factors to select models where multiple ecological factors are integrated into density estimation. our simulations demonstrate that these methods can help identify the ""true"" explanatory mechanisms underlying the data. using this method, we found strong evidence for sex-specific movement distributions in leopards, suggesting that sexual patterns of space-use influence density. this model estimated a density of 10.0 leopards/100 km(2) (95% credibility interval: 6.25-15.93), comparable to contemporary estimates in asia. these scr methods provide a guide to monitor and observe the effect of management interventions on leopards and other species of conservation interest."
"comparing spatial capture-recapture modeling and nest count methods to estimate orangutan densities in the wehea forest, east kalimantan, indonesia",pongo pygmaeus morio; population density; camera trapping; spatial capture-recapture models; nest surveys,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,SPEHAR SN;LOKEN B;RAYADIN Y;ROYLE JA,"accurate information on the density and abundance of animal populations is essential for understanding species'. ecology and for conservation planning, but is difficult to obtain. the endangered orangutan (pongo spp.) is an example; due to its elusive behavior and low densities, researchers have relied on methods that convert nest counts to orangutan densities and require substantial effort for reliable results. camera trapping and spatial capture-recapture (scr) models could provide an alternative but have not been used for primates. we compared density estimates calculated using the two methods for orangutans in the wehea forest, east kalimantan, indonesia. camera trapping/scr modeling produced a density estimate of 0.16 +/- 0.09-0.29 indiv/km(2), and nest counts produced a density estimate of 1.05 +/- 0.18-6.01 indiv/km(2). the large confidence interval of the nest count estimate is probably due to high variance in nest encounter rates, indicating the need for larger sample size and the substantial effort required to produce reliable results using this method. the scr estimate produced a very low density estimate and had a narrower but still fairly wide confidence interval. this was likely due to unmodeled heterogeneity and small sample size, specifically a low number of individual captures and recaptures. we propose methodological fixes that could address these issues and improve precision. a comparison of the overall costs and benefits of the two methods suggests that camera trapping/scr modeling can potentially be a useful tool for assessing the densities of orangutans and other elusive primates, and warrant further investigation to determine broad applicability and methodological adjustments needed.

spatial distribution drivers of amur leopard density in northeast china,amur leopard; camera trap; population size; spatially explicit capture-recapture model,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,QI JZ;SHI QH;WANG GM;LI ZL;SUN Q;HUA Y;JIANG GS,"the amur leopard (panthera pardus orientalis) is highly elusive, rare species, critically threatened with extinction worldwide. in this study, we conducted camera-trap surveys of an amur leopard population in jilin province, northeast china. we estimated population abundance and density distribution, and explored the effects of prey population densities and biomass of prey, habitat and anthropogenic factors on the spatial distribution of amur leopard density. our results suggested that amur leopard density was 0.62 individuals/100 km(2) and 16.58 individuals might live within the study area. the spatial distribution of amur leopard density exhibited different responses to the population densities of different prey species. we found that two ecological thresholds existed in maximum responses of amur leopard distribution to elevation and prey biomass. vegetation and anthropogenic factors also showed significant effects on leopard population distribution. in general, there was a combination of habitat factors including, not only prey assembly and biomass, but also vegetation, anthropogenic and geographical factors driving the spatial distribution of amur leopard population. these insights informed us that comprehensive adaptive landscape and prey conservation strategies should be conducted for saving this critically endangered predator.

relative contribution of local demography and immigration in the recovery of a geographically-isolated population of the endangered egyptian vulture,bird population dynamics; evidence-based conservation; integrated population models; capture-mark-recapture; neophron percnopterus; supplementary feeding,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,LIEURY N;GALLARDO M;PONCHON C;BESNARD A;MILLON A,"in a context of increasing concern for biodiversity conservation but decreasing resources devoted to species management, measuring the impact of actions is critically needed so as to optimise conservation practices. long-term longitudinal data collected on marked individuals allow for an assessment of the demographic response of a population to conservation actions while accounting for potential confounding factors. this study focused on the recovery of a geographically-isolated population of the endangered egyptian vulture in south-eastern france, which experienced food shortages induced by major changes in habitat and sanitary legislation limiting the abandonment of dead animals in the field. the survival rates and population dynamics of the egyptian vulture were computed, following the implementation of supplementary feeding stations, while accounting for the potential variation in environmental conditions on wintering grounds, reproduction and immigration. an integrated population model (ipm) was used to combine capture-resighting data with recoveries of dead birds, breeding surveys and counts of territorial pairs over a 16-year period. results showed that the implementation of vulture restaurants improved the local survival rates and successfully stabilised the local demography of egyptian vultures; this despite a reduction in average fecundity due to compensatory density feedback. moreover, throughout the study period, about two thirds of the new recruits into the breeding population were immigrants, suggesting immigration constantly sustained the egyptian vulture population in south-eastern france. however, we did not detect any effect of vulture restaurants on the immigration rate, indicating that the improvement of local survival by vulture restaurants remained the main driver of the positive shift in the population dynamics. this study highlights the positive impact of vulture restaurants on egyptian vulture population restoration by compensating for natural food limitations. it also points out the methodological importance of estimating immigration for understanding population dynamics and that large-scale monitoring and internationally-concerted conservation should be promoted.

apparent survival of north atlantic right whales after entanglement in fishing gear,by-catch; fisheries interactions; mark-recapture; endangered species; north america,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ROBBINS J;KNOWLTON AR;LANDRY S,"the impacts of human activities on cryptic marine species can be difficult to assess. the north atlantic right whale is an endangered species numbering just over 500 individuals. entanglement in fishing gear is one documented source of injury and mortality, but population-level effects have been difficult to quantify. we used documented entanglements, long-term population studies and mark-recapture statistical techniques to evaluate the effect of these events on north atlantic right whale survival. estimates were based on 50 individuals observed carrying entangling gear between 1995 and 2008, and compared to 459 others that were never observed with gear during the same period. entangled adults had low initial apparent survival (0.749, 95% cl: 0.601-0.855), but those that survived the first year achieved a survival rate (0.952, 95% cl: 0.907-0.977) that was more comparable to unaffected adult females (0.961,95% ci: 0.941-0.974) and males (0.986,95% ci: 0.975-0.993). juveniles had a post-entanglement survival rate that was comparable to the initial survival of entangled adults (0.733, 95% cl: 0.532-0.869) and lower than un-impacted juveniles (0.978, 95% ci: 0.969-0.985). of three entanglement characteristics examined, health impacts were most predictive of subsequent survival, but the entanglement configuration and the resulting injuries also appeared to affect outcome. when the entanglement configuration was assessed as high risk, human intervention (disentanglement) improved the survival outcome. this is the first mark-recapture estimate of entanglement survival for any whale species. the results indicate the need for continued mitigation efforts for this species, as well as for a better understanding of entanglement impacts in other baleen whale populations.

estimating occupancy dynamics for large-scale monitoring networks: amphibian breeding occupancy across protected areas in the northeast united states,ambystoma maculatum; hierarchical models; luthobates sylvaticus; occupancy; population trend,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,MILLER DAW;GRANT EHC,"regional monitoring strategies frequently employ a nested sampling design where a finite set of study areas from throughout a region are selected and intensive sampling occurs within a subset of sites within the individual study areas. this sampling protocol naturally lends itself to a hierarchical analysis to account for dependence among subsamples. implementing such an analysis using a classic likelihood framework is computationally challenging when accounting for detection errors in species occurrence models. bayesian methods offer an alternative approach for fitting models that readily allows for spatial structure to be incorporated. we demonstrate a general approach for estimating occupancy when data come from a nested sampling design. we analyzed data from a regional monitoring program of wood frogs (lithobates sylvaticus) and spotted salamanders (ambystoma maculatum) in vernal pools using static and dynamic occupancy models. we analyzed observations from 2004 to 2013 that were collected within 14 protected areas located throughout the northeast united states. we use the data set to estimate trends in occupancy at both the regional and individual protected area levels. we show that occupancy at the regional level was relatively stable for both species. however, substantial variation occurred among study areas, with some populations declining and some increasing for both species. in addition, when the hierarchical study design is not accounted for, one would conclude stronger support for latitudinal gradient in trends than when using our approach that accounts for the nested design. in contrast to the model that does not account for nesting, the nested model did not include an effect of latitude in the 95% credible interval. these results shed light on the range-level population status of these pond-breeding amphibians, and our approach provides a framework that can be used to examine drivers of local and regional occurrence dynamics."

a spatially explicit capture-recapture estimator for single-catch traps,density estimation; single-catch trap likelihood; spatially explicit capture-recapture; statistical methods,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,DISTILLER G;BORCHERS DL,"single-catch traps are frequently used in live-trapping studies of small mammals. thus far, a likelihood for single-catch traps has proven elusive and usually the likelihood for multicatch traps is used for spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) analyses of such data. previous work found the multicatch likelihood to provide a robust estimator of average density. we build on a recently developed continuous-time model for secr to derive a likelihood for single-catch traps. we use this to develop an estimator based on observed capture times and compare its performance by simulation to that of the multicatch estimator for various scenarios with nonconstant density surfaces. while the multicatch estimator is found to be a surprisingly robust estimator of average density, its performance deteriorates with high trap saturation and increasing density gradients. moreover, it is found to be a poor estimator of the height of the detection function. by contrast, the single-catch estimators of density, distribution, and detection function parameters are found to be unbiased or nearly unbiased in all scenarios considered. this gain comes at the cost of higher variance. if there is no interest in interpreting the detection function parameters themselves, and if density is expected to be fairly constant over the survey region, then the multicatch estimator performs well with single-catch traps. however if accurate estimation of the detection function is of interest, or if density is expected to vary substantially in space, then there is merit in using the single-catch estimator when trap saturation is above about 60%. the estimator's performance is improved if care is taken to place traps so as to span the range of variables that affect animal distribution. as a single-catch likelihood with unknown capture times remains intractable for now, researchers using single-catch traps should aim to incorporate timing devices with their traps."
"juvenile salmonid growth, survival, and production in a large river floodplain modified by beavers (castor canadensis)",NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,MALISON RL;EBY LA;STANFORD JA,"beavers (castor canadensis) may strongly influence juvenile salmon production by damming spring brooks that are primary rearing habitats on expansive floodplains of large pacific rim salmon rivers. we studied three floodplain rearing habitats in the kwethluk river, alaska: free-flowing (beaver-free, n = 3) and beaver-influenced (below beaver dams, n = 4) spring brooks and early-successional beaver ponds (n = 4). we analyzed juvenile coho (oncorhynchus kisutch) and chinook (oncorhynchus tshawytschwa) salmon movement, survival, densities, and growth using a multistate robust capture-mark-recapture design. survival (46% to 80%) and densities (0.9 fish.m(-2)) were highest in beaver-free spring brooks. ponds had lower salmon densities, producing less biomass per unit area than beaver-influenced or beaver-free spring brooks (1.87 +/- 0.57 g.m(-2) vs. 2.98 +/- 1.22 and 3.23 +/- 0.73 g.m(-2)). however, ponds covered 2x greater area than either type of spring brook and therefore produced more salmon biomass at the floodplain scale than either type of spring brook (175 kg vs. 149 kg in beaver-influenced spring brooks and 140 kg in beaver-free spring brooks). we conclude that beaver damming of floodplain spring brooks produces bigger juveniles and more total biomass, but spring brooks produce significantly more, albeit smaller, coho and chinook juveniles. thus, the presence of beavers on the floodplain increases habitat variation, which provides a larger range of growth opportunities for juvenile salmon."
mark-recapture estimation of snag standing rates in northern arizona mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine forests,aspen; dead trees; douglas-fir; gambel oak; pinus ponderosa; snag dynamics; snag longevity; white fir,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,GANEY JL;WHITE GC;JENNESS JS;VOJTA SC,"snags (standing dead trees) are important components of forests that provide resources for numerous species of wildlife and contribute to decay dynamics and other ecological processes. managers charged with managing populations of snags need information about standing rates of snags and factors influencing those rates, yet such data are limited for ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa) and especially mixed-conifer forests in the southwestern united states. we monitored standing rates of snags in 1-ha plots in arizona mixed-conifer (n=53 plots) and ponderosa pine (n=60 plots) forests from 1997 through 2012. we used the burnham live-dead, mark-resight model in program mark and multimodel inference to estimate standing rates during 5-year intervals while accounting for imperfect detection. because snag standing rates may be influenced by plot characteristics, we used plots rather than snags as sampling units and conducted bootstrap analyses (500 iterations per model) to resample plots and estimate standing rates and associated parameters. we modeled standing rates in 3 discrete steps. first, we selected a parsimonious base model from a set of models including snag species, and then we evaluated models created by adding snag and plot covariates to the base model in steps 2 and 3, respectively. snag standing rates differed among snag species and 5-year sampling intervals. standing rates were positively related to snag diameter, negatively related to snag height, and were lower for snags with intact tops than for broken-topped snags. standing rates also were positively related to topographic roughness, elevation, tree density, and an index of northness, and negatively related to slope and relative topographic exposure. our results provide comparative data on standing rates of multiple species of snags based on a large and spatially extensive sample and rigorous analysis, and quantify the relative importance of several snag and plot characteristics on those rates. they indicate that modeling snag dynamics is complicated by both spatial and temporal variation in standing rates and identify areas where further work is needed to facilitate such modeling. published 2015. this article is a u.s. government work and is in the public domain in the usa."
indirect effects of bioinvasions in yellowstone lake: the response of river otters to declines in native cutthroat trout,aquatic-terrestrial linkages; capture-recapture; introduced species; noninvasive sampling; population size; spawning,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,CRAIT JR;REGEHR EV;BEN DAVID M,"nonnative species threaten ecosystems throughout the world including protected reserves. in yellowstone national park, river otters lontra canadensis depend on native cutthroat trout as prey. however, nonnative lake trout and whirling disease have significantly reduced the abundance of these native fish in the park's largest body of water, yellowstone lake. we studied the demographic and behavioral responses of otters to declining cutthroat trout on yellowstone lake and its tributaries. from 2002-2008, we monitored otter activity at latrine (scentmarking) sites, collected scat for prey identification, and used individual genotypes from scat and hair samples to evaluate survival and abundance with capture-recapture methods. otter activity at latrines decreased with declines in cutthroat trout, and the prevalence of these fish in otter scat declined from 73% to 53%. cutthroat trout numbers were the best predictor of temporal variation in apparent survival, and mean annual survival for otters was low (0.72). the density of otters in out study area (1 otter per 13.4 km of shoreline) was also low, and evidence of a recent genetic bottleneck suggests that otter abundance might have declined prior to our study. river otters in and around yellowstone lake appear to be responding to reductions in cutthroat trout via changes in distribution, diet, and possibly survival and abundance. our results provide a baseline estimate for monitoring the broader outcome of management efforts to conserve native cutthroat trout and emphasize the indirect ecosystem consequences of invasive species.

compensatory immigration counteracts contrasting conservation strategies of wolverines (gulo gulo) within scandinavia,gulo gulo; harvest; multi-state models; non-invasive genetic sampling; survival; trans-boundary management; wolverine,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,GERVASI V;BROSETH H;NILSEN EB;ELLEGREN H;FLAGSTAD O;LINNELL JDC,"in wide ranging species, portions of the same population often fall within different administrative jurisdictions; where different regulations apply. the same species can be fully protected or heavily harvested on different sides of a border. this can generate a source-sink dynamic from the areas with lower to those with higher mortality, a process known as compensatory immigration. we tested this hypothesis on the wolverine (gulo o gulo) population of southern scandinavia, which is shared between two countries: sweden and norway. wolverines are fully protected in sweden, but subject to intensive population regulation in norway. using non-invasive genetic sampling and capture-recapture modeling, we analyzed the dynamics of wolverine survival and emigration patterns between 2002 and 2013. wolverines in norway experienced a lower survival than in sweden. migration across the national border was directed towards movements from sweden to norway. there was a functional relationship between harvest rate in norway and emigration rates across the national border, both at the individual and population level, thus confirming the compensatory immigration hypothesis. contrasting management regimes within the same population can generate undesired demographic and spatial dynamics, jeopardize conservation goals on the two sides of a border, and reduce the efficiency of management actions. this calls for the adoption of a coordinate population approach in large carnivore conservation and management. failing to do so can cause a waste of the already limited resources allocated for large carnivore conservation, and it might hinder effective conflict mitigation.

evidence of population resistance to extreme low flows in a fluvial-dependent fish species,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,KATZ RA;FREEMAN MC,"extreme low streamflows are natural disturbances to aquatic populations. species in naturally intermittent streams display adaptations that enhance persistence during extreme events; however, the fate of populations in perennial streams during unprecedented low-flow periods is not well-understood. biota requiring swift-flowing habitats may be especially vulnerable to flow reductions. we estimated the abundance and local survival of a native fluvial-dependent fish species (etheostoma inscriptum) across 5 years encompassing historic low flows in a sixth-order southeastern usa perennial river. based on capture-mark-recapture data, the study shoal may have acted as a refuge during severe drought, with increased young-of-the-year (yoy) recruitment and occasionally high adult immigration. contrary to expectations, summer and autumn survival rates (30 days) were not strongly depressed during low-flow periods, despite 25%-80% reductions in monthly discharge. instead, yoy survival increased with lower minimum discharge and in response to small rain events that increased low-flow variability. age-1+ fish showed the opposite pattern, with survival decreasing in response to increasing low-flow variability. results from this population dynamics study of a small fish in a perennial river suggest that fluvial-dependent species can be resistant to extreme flow reductions through enhanced yoy recruitment and high survival."

"population dynamics and site fidelity of the cave bat, myotis velifer, in oklahoma",capture probability; cave bat; demography; metapopulation; site fidelity; survival rate,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,HUMPHREY SR;OLI MK,"we characterized population dynamics of nonmigratory cave bats, myotis velifer, in oklahoma by locating all 21 caves known to be occupied in an exhaustively searched, large study area, marking representative samples with numbered wing bands and conducting annual winter counts and recaptures over a decade. bats moved readily among maternity caves during summer and among hibernating caves from winter to winter. the aggregate population of adults during lactation was about 13,600, including 10,500 females, of which 96% produced young. the aggregate population during winter was about 23,850 for the first 2 years of the study, declined to about 14,200 in the 3rd year, and recovered to > 20,000 for the last 4 years of the study. mortality events and threats documented included flooding, subfreezing temperatures, and rock collapses in caves, as well as in-cave disturbance by humans, but the cause of the decline was not identified. we used capture-mark-recapture methods to estimate and model capture probability (p) and apparent survival (.) from 1967-1968 to 1976-1977. based on bats marked as weaned juveniles at maternity caves, survival was lowest in the first 6 months of age and increased steadily in later age classes. females survived better than males. based on subadult and adult bats marked in winter, survival increased over the 1st half of the bats' 10-year life span and then declined over the 2nd half. these results show that survival is strongly sex-and age-specific, with lower survival for juveniles than for older bats and lower survival for males than for females. site fidelity was relatively weak, apparently enabled by the local abundance and proximity of caves. rapid recovery from a large population decline indicates substantial resilience in this metapopulation. in contrast, relatively stable numbers in the years before and after the decline suggest that some factor may limit population size under normal conditions.

application of spatial and closed capture-recapture models on known population of the western derby eland (taurotragus derbianus derbianus) in senegal,NA,PLOS ONE,JUNEK T;VYMYSLICKA PJ;HOZDECKA K;HEJCMANOVA P,"camera trapping with capture-recapture analyses has provided estimates of the abundances of elusive species over the last two decades. closed capture-recapture models (cr) based on the recognition of individuals and incorporating natural heterogeneity in capture probabilities are considered robust tools; however, closure assumption is often questionable and the use of an m-h jackknife estimator may fail in estimations of real abundance when the heterogeneity is high and data is sparse. a novel, spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) approach based on the location-specific capture histories of individuals overcomes the limitations of closed models. we applied both methods on a closed population of 16 critically endangered western derby elands in the fenced 1,060-ha fathala reserve, senegal. we analyzed the data from 30 cameras operating during a 66-day sampling period deployed in two densities in grid and line arrays. we captured and identified all 16 individuals in 962 trap-days. abundances were estimated in the programs capture (models m-0, mh and mh chao) and r, package secr (basic null and finite mixture models), and compared with the true population size. we specified 66 days as a threshold in which secr provides an accurate estimate in all trapping designs within the 7-times divergent density from 0.004 to 0.028 camera trap/ha. both secr models showed uniform tendency to overestimate abundance when sampling lasted shorter with no major differences between their outputs. unlike the closed models, secr performed well in the line patterns, which indicates promising potential for linear sampling of properly defined habitats of non-territorial and identifiable herbivores in dense wooded savanna conditions. the cr models provided reliable estimates in the grid and we confirmed the advantage of mh chao estimator over mh jackknife when data appeared sparse. we also demonstrated the pooling of trapping occasions with an increase in the capture probabilities, avoiding violation of results."
spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis of bobcat (lynx rufus) density: implications for mesocarnivore monitoring,camera-trap; felid; fort hood; occupancy; range-wide; synthesis,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,THORNTON DH;PEKINS CE,"context. accurate density estimation is crucial for conservation and management of elusive species. camera-trapping may provide an efficient method for density estimation, particularly when analysed with recently developed spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) models. although camera-traps are employed extensively to estimate large carnivore density, their use for smaller carnivores has been limited. moreover, while camera-trapping studies are typically conducted at local scales, the utility of analysing larger-scale patterns by combining multiple camera studies remains poorly known. aims. the goal of the present study was to develop a better understanding of the utility of secr models and camera-trapping for the estimation of density of small carnivores at local and regional scales. methods. based on data collected from camera-traps, we used secr to examine density of bobcats (lynx rufus) at four study sites in north-central texas. we then combined our density estimates with previous estimates (from multiple methodologies) across the bobcat's geographic range, and used linear regression to examine drivers of range-wide density patterns. key results. bobcat densities averaged 13.2 per 100 km(2) across all four study sites, and were lowest at the site in the most heavily modified landscape. bobcat capture probability was positively related to forest cover around camera-trap sites. at the range-wide scale, 53% of the variation in density was explained by just two factors: temperature and longitude. conclusions. our results demonstrate the utility of camera-traps, combined with secr, to generate precise density estimates for mesocarnivores, and reveal the negative effects of landscape disturbance on bobcat populations. the associations revealed in our range-wide analysis, despite variability in techniques used to estimate density, demonstrate how a combination of multiple density estimates for a species can be used for large-scale inference. however, improvement in our understanding of biogeographic density patterns for mesocarnivores could be obtained from a greater number of camera-based density estimates across the range of a species, combined with meta-analytic techniques. implications. camera-trapping and secr should be more widely applied to generate local density estimates for many small and medium-sized carnivores, where at least a portion of the individuals are identifiable. if such estimates are more widely obtained, meta-analytic techniques could be used to test biogeographic predictions or for large-scale monitoring efforts."
age-related effects of chronic hantavirus infection on female host fecundity,disease transmission; endemic pathogen; female fecundity; host-pathogen interaction; resource allocation,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,KALLIO ER;HELLE H;KOSKELA E;MAPPES T;VAPALAHTI O,"pathogens often cause detrimental effects to their hosts and, consequently, may influence host population dynamics that may, in turn, feed back to pathogen transmission dynamics. understanding fitness effects of pathogens upon animal host populations can help to predict the risks that zoonotic pathogens pose to humans. here we determine whether chronic infection by puumala hantavirus (puuv) affects important fitness-related traits, namely the probability of breeding, reproductive effort and mother and offspring condition, in the bank vole (myodes glareolus). using 9years empirical data in a puuv endemic area in central finland, we found differences between reproductive characteristics of puuv-infected and uninfected female bank voles. young infected females had a significantly higher, and old individuals lower, likelihood of reproducing than uninfected animals during the middle of the breeding season. the implication is that puuv infection may have long-term deleterious effects that are observed at old age, while in young individuals, the infection may enhance breeding probability by directing resources towards current breeding. moreover, puuv infection was related with the mother's body condition. infected mothers were in poorer condition than uninfected mothers in the early breeding season, but were in better condition than uninfected mothers during the middle of the breeding season. offspring body condition was positively associated with mother's body condition, which, in turn, was related to the puuv infection status of the mother. our findings indicate that chronic infection may affect the reproduction of female hosts, but the effect is dependent on the host age. the effect of chronic hantavirus infection was small and density-independent and hence unlikely to contribute to the cyclic population dynamics of the host. however, the effects on a female's reproductive output might affect the abundance of young susceptible individuals in the population and hence influence the transmission and persistence of the pathogen. although experimental and long-term capture-mark-recapture studies are required to further clarify the fitness effects of hantavirus infection and their consequences for pathogen dynamics, this study shows that the infection may have complex effects that are dependent on the age of the individual and the time of the breeding season."
antagonistic effect of helpers on breeding male and female survival in a cooperatively breeding bird,cooperative breeding; family conflicts; investment; life-history strategies; sex-specific selection,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,PAQUET M;DOUTRELANT C;HATCHWELL BJ;SPOTTISWOODE CN;COVAS R,"cooperatively breeding species are typically long lived and hence, according to theory, are expected to maximize their lifetime reproductive success through maximizing survival. under these circumstances, the presence of helpers could be used to lighten the effort of current reproduction for parents to achieve higher survival. in addition, individuals of different sexes and ages may follow different strategies, but whether male and female breeders and individuals of different ages benefit differently from the presence of helpers has often been overlooked. moreover, only one study that investigated the relationship between parental survival and the presence of helpers used capture-mark-recapture analyses (cmr). these methods are important since they allow us to account for the non-detection of individuals that are alive in the population but not detected, and thus, the effects on survival and recapture probability to be disentangled. here, we used multi-event cmr methods to investigate whether the number of helpers was associated with an increase in survival probability for male and female breeders of different ages in the sociable weaver philetairus socius. in this species, both sexes reduce their feeding rate in the presence of helpers. we therefore predicted that the presence of helpers should increase the breeders' survival in both sexes, especially early in life when individuals potentially have more future breeding opportunities. in addition, sociable weaver females reduce their investment in eggs in the presence of helpers, so we predicted a stronger effect of helpers on female than male survival. as expected we found that females had a higher survival probability when breeding with more helpers. unexpectedly, however, male survival probability decreased with increasing number of helpers. this antagonistic effect diminished as the breeders grew older. these results illustrate the complexity of fitness costs and benefits underlying cooperative behaviours and how these may vary with the individuals' sex and age. they also highlight the need for further studies on the sex-specific effects of helpers on survival."

camera traps and mark-resight models: the value of ancillary data for evaluating assumptions,ancillary data; camera traps; detection bias; mark-resight; population estimation; procyon lotor; raccoon,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,PARSONS AW;SIMONS TR;POLLOCK KH;STOSKOPF MK;STOCKING JJ;O CONNELL AF,"unbiased estimators of abundance and density are fundamental to the study of animal ecology and critical for making sound management decisions. capture-recapture models are generally considered the most robust approach for estimating these parameters but rely on a number of assumptions that are often violated but rarely validated. mark-resight models, a form of capture-recapture, are well suited for use with noninvasive sampling methods and allow for a number of assumptions to be relaxed. we used ancillary data from continuous video and radio telemetry to evaluate the assumptions of mark-resight models for abundance estimation on a barrier island raccoon (procyon lotor) population using camera traps. our island study site was geographically closed, allowing us to estimate real survival and in situ recruitment in addition to population size. we found several sources of bias due to heterogeneity of capture probabilities in our study, including camera placement, animal movement, island physiography, and animal behavior. almost all sources of heterogeneity could be accounted for using the sophisticated mark-resight models developed by mcclintock et al. (2009b) and this model generated estimates similar to a spatially explicit mark-resight model previously developed for this population during our study. spatially explicit capture-recapture models have become an important tool in ecology and confer a number of advantages; however, non-spatial models that account for inherent individual heterogeneity may perform nearly as well, especially where immigration and emigration are limited. non-spatial models are computationally less demanding, do not make implicit assumptions related to the isotropy of home ranges, and can provide insights with respect to the biological traits of the local population.

population density and climate shape early-life survival and recruitment in a long-lived pelagic seabird,capture-mark-recapture; diomedea exulans; juvenile vital rates; population dynamics; wandering albatross,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,FAY R;WEIMERSKIRCH H;DELORD K;BARBRAUD C,"our understanding of demographic processes is mainly based on analyses of traits from the adult component of populations. early-life demographic traits are poorly known mainly for methodological reasons. yet, survival of juvenile and immature individuals is critical for the recruitment into the population and thus for the whole population dynamic, especially for long-lived species. this bias currently restrains our ability to fully understand population dynamics of long-lived species and life-history theory. the goal of this study was to estimate the early-life demographic parameters of a long-lived species with a long immature period (9-10years), to test for sex and age effects on these parameters and to identify the environmental factors encountered during the period of immaturity that may influence survival and recruitment. using capture-mark-recapture multievent models allowing us to deal with uncertain and unobservable individual states, we analysed a long-term data set of wandering albatrosses to estimate both age- and sex-specific early-life survival and recruitment. we investigated environmental factors potentially driving these demographic traits using climatic and fisheries covariates and tested for density dependence. our study provides for the first time an estimate of annual survival during the first 2years at sea for an albatross species (08010014). both age and sex affected early-life survival and recruitment processes of this long-lived seabird species. early-life survival and recruitment were highly variable across years although the sensitivity of young birds to environmental variability decreased with age. early-life survival was negatively associated with sea surface temperature, and recruitment rate was positively related to both southern annular mode and sea surface temperature. we found strong evidence for density-dependent mortality of juveniles. population size explained 41% of the variation of this parameter over the study period. these results indicate that early-life survival and recruitment were strongly age and sex dependent in a dimorphic long-lived species. in addition, early-life demographic parameters were affected by natal environmental conditions and by environmental conditions faced during the period of immaturity. finally, our results constitute one of the first demonstrations of density dependence on juvenile survival in seabirds, with major consequences for our understanding of population dynamics in seabirds."

face value: towards robust estimates of snow leopard densities,NA,PLOS ONE,ALEXANDER JS;GOPALASWAMY AM;SHI K;RIORDAN P,"when densities of large carnivores fall below certain thresholds, dramatic ecological effects can follow, leading to oversimplified ecosystems. understanding the population status of such species remains a major challenge as they occur in low densities and their ranges are wide. this paper describes the use of non-invasive data collection techniques combined with recent spatial capture-recapture methods to estimate the density of snow leopards panthera uncia. it also investigates the influence of environmental and human activity indicators on their spatial distribution. a total of 60 camera traps were systematically set up during a three-month period over a 480 km(2) study area in qilianshan national nature reserve, gansu province, china. we recorded 76 separate snow leopard captures over 2,906 trap-days, representing an average capture success of 2.62 captures/100 trap-days. we identified a total number of 20 unique individuals from photographs and estimated snow leopard density at 3.31 (se = 1.01) individuals per 100 km(2). results of our simulation exercise indicate that our estimates from the spatial capture recapture models were not optimal to respect to bias and precision (rmses for density parameters less or equal to 0.87). our results underline the critical challenge in achieving sufficient sample sizes of snow leopard captures and recaptures. possible performance improvements are discussed, principally by optimising effective camera capture and photographic data quality."
a unimodal model for double observer distance sampling surveys,NA,PLOS ONE,BECKER EF;CHRIST AM,"distance sampling is a widely used method to estimate animal population size. most distance sampling models utilize a monotonically decreasing detection function such as a half-normal. recent advances in distance sampling modeling allow for the incorporation of covariates into the distance model, and the elimination of the assumption of perfect detection at some fixed distance (usually the transect line) with the use of double-observer models. the assumption of full observer independence in the double-observer model is problematic, but can be addressed by using the point independence assumption which assumes there is one distance, the apex of the detection function, where the 2 observers are assumed independent. aerially collected distance sampling data can have a unimodal shape and have been successfully modeled with a gamma detection function. covariates in gamma detection models cause the apex of detection to shift depending upon covariate levels, making this model incompatible with the point independence assumption when using double-observer data. this paper reports a unimodal detection model based on a two-piece normal distribution that allows covariates, has only one apex, and is consistent with the point independence assumption when double-observer data are utilized. an aerial line-transect survey of black bears in alaska illustrate how this method can be applied."
population ecology of a california endemic: speyeria adiaste clemencei,demography; viola purpurea; nymphalidae; mark-recapture,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,ZAMAN K;TENNEY C;RUSH CE;HILL RI,"effective management and recovery of threatened insect populations requires detailed ecological information. here we combine count and mark recapture (mr) data to shed light on an understudied declining endemic butterfly species in california's southern coast ranges, speyeria adiaste. little is known about the number, size, and dynamics of s. adiaste populations, leaving few data on which to base conservation decisions. our goal in this study was therefore to provide increased understanding of the population ecology of this species by studying a long-standing s. adiaste clemencei population. our 2-year mr estimates were highly correlated with pollard walk counts, and we observed declining population sizes from 2011 to 2014. adult movements were well-described by a negative exponential function, indicating low probability of dispersal > 5 km (probability < 1.8 x 10(-7) for both sexes). males had shorter lifespans than females. coupled with lack of diapause in this species, the short life span and limited dispersal observed here indicate that s. adiaste clemencei does not have a strong capacity for re-colonization. population declines in s. adiaste may lead to local extinctions, and together with low dispersal, may diminish connectivity among the apparently small and isolated remaining populations. further research into the role of adult and larval resources for determining adult abundance, coupled with continued long-term monitoring is necessary in order to understand population dynamics in this declining endemic species."

estimating population sizes of leopard cats in the western ghats using camera surveys,abundance estimation; camera surveys; india; prionailurus bengalensis; protected areas; secondary forests; small carnivores,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,SRIVATHSA A;PARAMESHWARAN R;SHARMA S;KARANTH KU,"the status of several small carnivores in asia remains poorly known because of the lack of rigorous population assessments. the leopard cat prionailurus bengalensis is one such species assumed to be common and widespread within the indian subcontinent. we conducted surveys using automated cameras to estimate densities and abundance of leopard cats in and around 4 protected reserves in the western ghats of india. a total effort of 16,736 camera-days across a 2,075-km(2) area resulted in 65 detections of 43 uniquely identified individuals. we estimated leopard cat densities using closed population spatial capture-recapture models under a bayesian framework. estimated density was highest in bhadra tiger reserve at 10.45 (+/- 3.03 sd)/100 km(2) followed by 4.48 (+/- 1.31 sd)/100 km(2) in biligiri rangaswamy temple (brt) tiger reserve. the surveys yielded sparse data from nagarahole and bandipur reserves. high local densities in bhadra and brt were clustered around secondary, disturbed or partially modified forests and human-use areas. our results provide information critical to the conservation of leopard cats, emphasizing the importance of maintaining habitat buffers and wildlife-permeable areas around protected reserves. insights from our study highlight the potential of the western ghats landscape to serve as a long-term conservation area for leopard cats. further, our study demonstrates the utility of spatially explicit capture-recapture methods for estimating populations of leopard cats, and may be applied to other threatened small carnivores that are uniquely identified from their morphological features."
limited catching bias in a wild population of birds with near-complete census information,capture methods; house sparrow; island populations; methodology; ornithology; trappability,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SIMONS MJP;WINNEY I;NAKAGAWA S;BURKE T;SCHROEDER J,"animal research often relies on catching wild animals; however, individuals may have different trappability, and this can generate bias. we studied bias in mist netting, the main method for catching wild birds. the unusually high resighting rate in our study populationhouse sparrows (passer domesticus) on lundy island (england)allowed us to obtain accurate estimates of the population size. this unique situation enabled us to test for catching bias in mist netting using deviations from the expected poisson distribution. there was no evidence that a fraction of the birds in the population consistently remained uncaught. however, we detected a different bias: more birds than expected were captured only once within a year. this bias probably resulted from a mixture of fieldworkers sometimes ignoring rapid recaptures and birds becoming net shy after their first capture. we had sufficient statistical power with the available data to detect a substantial uncaught fraction. therefore, our data are probably unbiased toward catching specific individuals from our population. our analyses demonstrate that intensively monitored natural insular populations, in which population size can be estimated precisely, provide the potential to address important unanswered questions without concerns about a fraction of the population remaining uncaught. our approach can help researchers to test for catching bias in closely monitored wild populations for which reliable estimates of population size and dispersal are available."

endangered florida panther population size determined from public reports of motor vehicle collision mortalities,abundance; capture-recapture; citizen science; dead recovery; human-wildlife ecology; imperfect detection; mark-resight; puma concolor coryi; risk of collision; telemetry,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MCCLINTOCK BT;ONORATO DP;MARTIN J,"reliably estimating the abundance of rare or elusive animals is notoriously difficult. an archetypical example is the endangered florida panther, whose conservation status is intrinsically linked to population size, but for which reliable abundance information is lacking across its range. this is due not only to the inherent difficulty of sampling a rare and elusive species over a large geographic area, but also because of restricted scientific access to private land. human interactions with wildlife are a regular occurrence, and interactions with non-scientists constitute an important and underutilized source of information about species distribution and abundance. for example, motor vehicle collisions with florida panthers are recurrent on the vast network of roads within the public and private lands comprising its range in southern florida, usa. capitalizing on a tendency for the public to report collisions with species of concern to wildlife officials, we describe a novel methodology using public reports along with routine telemetry monitoring data to produce the first statistically defensible population estimates for the florida panther across its entire breeding range. in essence, our approach uses traffic volume and road density to estimate the probability of motor vehicle collision mortality from telemetered animals and models counts reported by the public accordingly. despite low motor vehicle collision mortality probabilities, our methodology achieved abundance estimates of reasonable precision (29% cv) that was similar to that of previous panther studies using conventional approaches on much smaller study areas. while recovery criteria require establishment of three distinct populations of 240 florida panthers, we found this single population may never have exceeded 150 individuals from 2000 to 2012.synthesis and applications. by extracting critical demographic information from underutilized aspects of human-wildlife ecology, our citizen-based approach can cost less than conventional alternatives and could conceivably be used for long-term population monitoring of other species over broad geographic areas, for example from reports of avian wind farm collisions, beached whales or marine mammal boat strikes. an additional benefit is that it can be applied to historical data sets of carcass recovery programmes, in our case permitting abundance estimation over a 13-year period. by extracting critical demographic information from underutilized aspects of human-wildlife ecology, our citizen-based approach can cost less than conventional alternatives and could conceivably be used for long-term population monitoring of other species over broad geographic areas, for example from reports of avian wind farm collisions, beached whales or marine mammal boat strikes. an additional benefit is that it can be applied to historical data sets of carcass recovery programmes, in our case permitting abundance estimation over a 13-year period."

heterogeneous movement of insectivorous amazonian birds through primary and secondary forest: a case study using multistate models with radiotelemetry data,amazon; fidelity fragmentation; neotropical birds; secondary forest; multistate models; movement probability,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,POWELL LL;WOLFE JD;JOHNSON EI;HINES JE;NICHOLS JD;STOUFFER PC,"given rates of deforestation, disturbance, and secondary forest accumulation in tropical rainforests, there is a great need to quantify habitat use and movement among different habitats. this need is particularly pronounced for animals most sensitive to disturbance, such as insectivorous understory birds. here we use multistate capture-recapture models with radiotelemetry data to determine the successional stage at which within-day movement probabilities of amazonian birds in secondary forest are similar to those in primary forest. we radio-tracked three common understory insectivore species in primary and secondary forest at the biological dynamics of forest fragments project near manaus, brazil: two woodcreepers, glyphorynchus spirurus (n = 19) and xiphorhynchus pardalotus (n = 18), and the terrestrial antthrush formicarius colma (n = 19). forest age was a strong predictor of fidelity to a given habitat. all three species showed greater fidelity to primary forest than to 8-14-year-old secondary forest, indicating the latter's relatively poor quality. the two woodcreeper species used 12-18-year-old secondary forest in a manner comparable to continuous forest, but f. colma avoided moving even to 27-31-year-old secondary forest the oldest at our site. our results suggest that managers concerned with less sensitive species can assume that forest reserves connected by 12-18-year-old secondary forest corridors are effectively connected. on the other hand, >30 years are required after land abandonment before secondary forest serves as a primary forest-like conduit for movement by f. colma; more sensitive terrestrial insectivores may take longer still. published by elsevier ltd."
a comparison of grizzly bear demographic parameters estimated from non-spatial and spatial open population capture-recapture models,NA,PLOS ONE,WHITTINGTON J;SAWAYA MA,"capture-recapture studies are frequently used to monitor the status and trends of wildlife populations. detection histories from individual animals are used to estimate probability of detection and abundance or density. the accuracy of abundance and density estimates depends on the ability to model factors affecting detection probability. non-spatial capture-recapture models have recently evolved into spatial capture-recapture models that directly include the effect of distances between an animal's home range centre and trap locations on detection probability. most studies comparing non-spatial and spatial capture-recapture biases focussed on single year models and no studies have compared the accuracy of demographic parameter estimates from open population models. we applied open population non-spatial and spatial capture-recapture models to three years of grizzly bear dna-based data from banff national park and simulated data sets. the two models produced similar estimates of grizzly bear apparent survival, per capita recruitment, and population growth rates but the spatial capture-recapture models had better fit. simulations showed that spatial capture-recapture models produced more accurate parameter estimates with better credible interval coverage than non-spatial capture-recapture models. non-spatial capture-recapture models produced negatively biased estimates of apparent survival and positively biased estimates of per capita recruitment. the spatial capture-recapture grizzly bear population growth rates and 95% highest posterior density averaged across the three years were 0.925 (0.786-1.071) for females, 0.844 (0.703-0.975) for males, and 0.882 (0.779-0.981) for females and males combined. the non-spatial capture-recapture population growth rates were 0.894 (0.758-1.024) for females, 0.825 (0.700-0.948) for males, and 0.863 (0.771-0.957) for both sexes. the combination of low densities, low reproductive rates, and predominantly negative population growth rates suggest that banff national park's population of grizzly bears requires continued conservation-oriented management actions."
shifting effects of ocean conditions on survival and breeding probability of a long-lived seabird,NA,PLOS ONE,SCHMIDT AE;DYBALA KE;BOTSFORD LW;EADIE JM;BRADLEY RW;JAHNCKE J,"with a rapidly changing climate, there is an increasing need to predict how species will respond to changes in the physical environment. one approach is to use historic data to estimate the past influence of environmental variation on important demographic parameters and then use these relationships to project the abundance of a population or species under future climate scenarios. however, as novel climate conditions emerge, novel species responses may also appear. in some systems, environmental conditions beyond the range of those observed during the course of most long-term ecological studies are already evident. yet little attention has been given to how these novel conditions may be influencing previously established environment-species relationships. here, we model the relationships between ocean conditions and the demography of a long-lived seabird, brandt's cormorant (phalacrocorax penicillatusi), in central california and show that these relationships have changed in recent years. beginning in 2007/2008, the response of brandt's cormorant, an upper trophic level predator, to ocean conditions shifted, resulting in lower than predicted survival and breeding probability. survival was generally less variable than breeding probability and was initially best predicted by the basin-scale forcing of the el nino southern oscillation rather than local ocean conditions. the shifting response of brandt's cormorant to ocean conditions may be just a proximate indication of altered dynamics in the food web and that important forage fish are not responding to the physical ocean environment as expected. these changing relationships have important implications for our ability to project the effects of future climate change for species and communities."
mark-resight estimates of seasonal variation in harbor seal abundance and site fidelity,haul-out probability; individual-based; mark-recapture; phoca vitulina; photo-identification; population dynamics,POPULATION ECOLOGY,CORDES LS;THOMPSON PM,"monitoring trends in abundance of pinnipeds typically involves counting seals at terrestrial haul-out sites during the breeding season. counts of seals made at other times of the year are typically lower; however, it is often unknown whether this is because fewer animals are present or whether lower counts simply reflect a reduction in haul-out probability. here we illustrate how photo-identification data from an individual-based study of harbor seals (phoca vitulina) can be used to estimate seasonal variation in abundance and site fidelity. monthly data collected over a two-year period were analyzed using a mark-recapture mark-resight model accounting for individuals transitioning between observable and unobservable states. levels of site fidelity were high throughout the year and abundance estimates showed no seasonal pattern. this suggests that individual seals used haul-out sites to the same extent throughout the year, and that peaks in counts during the breeding season are a result of seasonal changes in haul-out probability. the results of this study have implications for understanding population sub-structuring, gene flow and disease spread."

survival and local recruitment are driven by environmental carry-over effects from the wintering area in a migratory seabird,common tern; marine primary productivity; migration; naoi; soi; sterna hirundo,OECOLOGIA,SZOSTEK KL;BECKER PH,"we estimated annual apparent survival rates, as well as local recruitment rates in different age groups and for different breeding status in the common tern sterna hirundo using mark-recapture analysis on a long-term individual-based dataset from a breeding colony in germany. strong inter-annual variability in survival rates became apparent, especially in prospectors. local recruitment also varied strongly between years and age groups. to explain these fluctuations, we linked survival and recruitment estimates to several environmental covariates expected to be limiting during the wintering period and migration, including the global climate indices of north atlantic oscillation and southern oscillation, fish abundance indices, and marine primary productivity in the west african wintering area. contrary to expectations, global indices did not seem to be linked strongly to vital rates. results showed that primary productivity had the strongest effect on annual survival, especially in young and inexperienced individuals. primary productivity in the wintering area was also strongly associated with the probability of recruitment in the following breeding season, indicating that conditions during winter can have carry-over effects on the life cycle of individuals."
integrating acoustic telemetry into mark-recapture models to improve the precision of apparent survival and abundance estimates,cjs; js; popan; broadnose sevengill sharks; capture-recapture; population estimation,OECOLOGIA,DUDGEON CL;POLLOCK KH;BRACCINI JM;SEMMENS JM;BARNETT A,"capture-mark-recapture models are useful tools for estimating demographic parameters but often result in low precision when recapture rates are low. low recapture rates are typical in many study systems including fishing-based studies. incorporating auxiliary data into the models can improve precision and in some cases enable parameter estimation. here, we present a novel application of acoustic telemetry for the estimation of apparent survival and abundance within capture-mark-recapture analysis using open population models. our case study is based on simultaneously collecting longline fishing and acoustic telemetry data for a large mobile apex predator, the broadnose sevengill shark (notorhynchus cepedianus), at a coastal site in tasmania, australia. cormack-jolly-seber models showed that longline data alone had very low recapture rates while acoustic telemetry data for the same time period resulted in at least tenfold higher recapture rates. the apparent survival estimates were similar for the two datasets but the acoustic telemetry data showed much greater precision and enabled apparent survival parameter estimation for one dataset, which was inestimable using fishing data alone. combined acoustic telemetry and longline data were incorporated into jolly-seber models using a monte carlo simulation approach. abundance estimates were comparable to those with longline data only; however, the inclusion of acoustic telemetry data increased precision in the estimates. we conclude that acoustic telemetry is a useful tool for incorporating in capture-mark-recapture studies in the marine environment. future studies should consider the application of acoustic telemetry within this framework when setting up the study design and sampling program."

estimating population size for capercaillie (tetrao urogallus l.) with spatial capture-recapture models based on genotypes from one field sample,NA,PLOS ONE,MOLLET P;KERY M;GARDNER B;PASINELLI G;ROYLE JA,"we conducted a survey of an endangered and cryptic forest grouse, the capercaillie tetrao urogallus, based on droppings collected on two sampling occasions in eight forest fragments in central switzerland in early spring 2009. we used genetic analyses to sex and individually identify birds. we estimated sex-dependent detection probabilities and population size using a modern spatial capture-recapture (scr) model for the data from pooled surveys. a total of 127 capercaillie genotypes were identified (77 males, 46 females, and 4 of unknown sex). the scr model yielded atotal population size estimate (posterior mean) of 137.3 capercaillies (posterior sd 4.2, 95% cri 130-147). the observed sex ratio was skewed towards males (0.63). the posterior mean of the sex ratio under the scr model was 0.58 (posterior sd 0.02, 95% cri 0.54-0.61), suggesting a male-biased sex ratio in our study area. a subsampling simulation study indicated that a reduced sampling effort representing 75% of the actual detections would still yield practically acceptable estimates of total size and sex ratio in our population. hence, field work and financial effort could be reduced without compromising accuracy when the scr model is used to estimate key population parameters of cryptic species."
unintended consequences of management actions in salt pond restoration: cascading effects in trophic interactions,NA,PLOS ONE,TAKEKAWA JY;ACKERMAN JT;BRAND LA;GRAHAM TR;EAGLES SMITH CA;HERZOG MP;TOPPING BR;SHELLENBARGER GG;KUWABARA JS;MRUZ E;PIOTTER SL;ATHEARN ND,"salt evaporation ponds have played an important role as habitat for migratory waterbirds across the world, however, efforts to restore and manage these habitats to maximize their conservation value has proven to be challenging. for example, salinity reduction has been a goal for restoring and managing former salt evaporation ponds to support waterbirds in the south bay salt pond restoration project in san francisco bay, california, usa. here, we describe a case study of unexpected consequences of a low-dissolved oxygen (do) event on trophic interactions in a salt pond system following management actions to reduce salinity concentrations. we document the ramifications of an anoxic event in water quality including salinity, do, and temperature, and in the response of the biota including prey fish biomass, numerical response by california gulls (larus californicus), and chick survival of forster's tern (sterna forsteri). management actions intended to protect receiving waters resulted in decreased do concentrations that collapsed to zero for >= 4 consecutive days, resulting in an extensive fish kill. do depletion likely resulted from an algal bloom that arose following transition of the pond system from high to low salinity as respiration and decomposition outpaced photosynthetic production. we measured a >= 6-fold increase in biomass of fish dropped on the levee by foraging avian predators compared with weeks prior to and following the low-do event. california gulls rapidly responded to the availability of aerobically-stressed and vulnerable fish and increased in abundance by two orders of magnitude. mark-recapture analysis of 254 forster's tern chicks indicated that their survival declined substantially following the increase in gull abundance. thus, management actions to reduce salinity concentrations resulted in cascading effects in trophic interactions that serves as a cautionary tale illustrating the importance of understanding the interaction of water quality and trophic structure when managing restoration of salt ponds."
reproductive consequences of the timing of seasonal movements in a nonmigratory wild bird population,"arrival time; breeding success; capture-recapture-resight; great tit; parus major; reproductive outcome; super-population; synchronous arrival; wytham woods, uk",ECOLOGY,MATECHOU E;CHENG SC;KIDD LR;GARROWAY CJ,"animal movement patterns, whether related to dispersal, migration, or ranging behaviors, vary in time. individual movements reflect the outcomes of interactions between an individual's condition and a multitude of underlying ecological processes. theory predicts that when competition for breeding territories is high, individuals should arrive at breeding sites earlier than what would otherwise be optimal for breeding in the absence of competition. this is because priority at a site can confer significant competitive advantages leading to better breeding outcomes. empirical data from long-distance migrants support this theory. however, it has not been tested within the context of fine-scale movements in nonmigratory populations. we assessed the effect of arrival time at a breeding site on reproductive outcomes in an intensively monitored resident population of great tits (parus major). the population was monitored passively, via passive integrated transponder (pit) tag loggers, and actively, via catching, during breeding and nonbreeding seasons. we developed new capture-recapture-resight models that use both data types to model breeding outcome conditional on the unknown individual arrival times. in accordance with theory, individuals arrived at the woods synchronously in waves that were large at the beginning of the nonbreeding season and small toward the end, with very few arrivals in the intervening period. there was a strong effect of arrival time on the probability of breeding; the earlier an individual arrived, the more likely it was to successfully establish a nest that reached the incubation period. however, once nests were established, they had equal probabilities of failing early, regardless of arrival time. finally, there was moderate evidence of a negative effect of arrival time on the probability of successfully fledging nestlings. these empirical findings are consistent with theoretical models that suggest an important role for competition in shaping fine-scale seasonal movements. our capture-recapture-resight models are extensible and suitable for a variety of applications, particularly when the goal is to estimate the effects of unobservable arrival times on subsequent ecological outcomes."
spatial variation in population density affects dispersal behavior in brush mice,density dependence; dispersal; peromyscus boylii; population density; spatially explicit capture-recapture models,ECOLOGY,WOJAN CM;KNAPP SM;MABRY KE,"population density can influence all three phases of natal dispersal: departure from the place of birth, searching the landscape, and selecting a new site in which to settle. the direction of the effect of density on dispersal should be affected by the relative costs and benefits of living in an area with high population density. animals may benefit from high population density due to mate availability and predator risk dilution, but may also face increased competition in high density areas. these conflicting mechanisms should influence the pattern of change in population density between pre- and post-dispersal locations: do dispersing individuals choose to move to areas of higher or lower population density than that at their natal site? we examined the influence of density on dispersal in brush mice (peromyscus boylii). we documented pre-and post-dispersal locations of individuals using both radio telemetry and live-trapping, and used a spatially explicit capture-recapture model to estimate density across the landscape. we also tested for a relationship between dispersal distance and local population density at the natal site. animals tended to settle in areas with higher population densities than where they were born. this pattern held when landscape-level changes in population density were incorporated: the magnitude of change in local population density between the pre-and post-dispersal locations of a given individual tended to be greater than would be explained by increasing population density across the landscape alone. further, dispersal distances were shorter when local natal population density was higher."

novel use of pit tags in sea cucumbers: promising results with the commercial species cucumaria frondosa,NA,PLOS ONE,GIANASI BL;VERKAIK K;HAMEL JF;MERCIER A,"the lack of a reliable and innocuous mark-recapture method has limited studies that would provide essential information for the management of commercial sea cucumbers. tagging sea cucumbers is notoriously difficult because of their plastic nature and autolysis capacities. the markers that have so far been tested, mainly on or through the body wall, were either lost rapidly or had major drawbacks (e.g. suitable only for batch identification, requiring complex analysis, causing infections, necrosis, behavioural changes and mortality). the present study explored the efficacy of passive integrated transponder (pit) tags for individually marking sea cucumbers by assessing retention rates and long-term side effects of tags inserted in previously unstudied tissues/organs. individuals of the species cucumaria frondosa were tagged in the body wall, aquapharyngeal bulb and at the base of the oral tentacles. they were monitored closely for evidence of stress, infection, change in feeding and spawning behaviour and tag retention rate. implanting the tag in an oral tentacle to reach the hydrovascular system of the aquapharyngeal bulb achieved the best retention rates in full-size individuals: from a maximum of 92% after 30 days to 68% at the end of the experimental period (300 days). efficacy was lower in smaller individuals (84% after 30 d and 42% after 300 d). following a slight increase in cloacal movements for 15 h post tagging, no side effect was noted in sea cucumbers tagged in the aquapharyngeal bulb via the tentacles. feeding and spawning behaviours were not affected and no signs of infections or abnormal cell development in the vicinity of the tags were observed. this study indicates that marking sea cucumbers with 8.2 mm long pit tags implanted via the oral tentacle is an effective technique, yielding relatively high retention rates over long periods without any detectable physiological or behavioural effects."
non-invasive genetic mark-recapture as a means to study population sizes and marking behaviour of the elusive eurasian otter (lutra lutra),NA,PLOS ONE,LAMPA S;MIHOUB JB;GRUBER B;KLENKE R;HENLE K,"quantifying population status is a key objective in many ecological studies, but is often difficult to achieve for cryptic or elusive species. here, non-invasive genetic capture-mark-recapture (cmr) methods have become a very important tool to estimate population parameters, such as population size and sex ratio. the eurasian otter (lutra lutra) is such an elusive species of management concern and is increasingly studied using faecal-based genetic sampling. for unbiased sex ratios or population size estimates, the marking behaviour of otters has to be taken into account. using 2132 otter faeces of a wild otter population in upper lusatia (saxony, germany) collected over six years (2006-2012), we studied the marking behaviour and applied closed population cmr models accounting for genetic mis-identification to estimate population sizes and sex ratios. we detected a sex difference in the marking behaviour of otters with jelly samples being more often defecated by males and placed actively exposed on frequently used marking sites. since jelly samples are of higher dna quality, it is important to not only concentrate on this kind of samples or marking sites and to invest in sufficiently high numbers of repetitions of non-jelly samples to ensure an unbiased sex ratio. furthermore, otters seemed to increase marking intensity due to the handling of their spraints, hence accounting for this behavioural response could be important. we provided the first precise population size estimate with confidence intervals for upper lusatia (for 2012: (n) over cap = 20 +/- 2.1, 95% ci = 16-25) and showed that spraint densities are not a reliable index for abundances. we further demonstrated that when minks live in sympatry with otters and have comparably high densities, a non-negligible number of supposed otter samples are actually of mink origin. this could severely bias results of otter monitoring if samples are not genetically identified."

effects of predation on telemetry-based survival estimates: insights from a study on endangered atlantic salmon smolts,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,GIBSON AJF;HALFYARD EA;BRADFORD RG;STOKESBURY MJW;REDDEN AM,"telemetry is increasingly being used to estimate population-level survival rates. however, these estimates may be affected by the detectability of telemetry tags and are reliant on the assumption that telemetry data represent the movements of the tagged fish. predation on tagged fish has the potential to bias survival estimates, and unlike the issue of detectability, methods to correct for the resulting bias (termed ""predation bias"") are not yet developed. in an acoustic telemetry study on inner bay of fundy atlantic salmon (salmo salar) smolts during 2008 and 2011, unusual tag detection patterns were indicative that some data may have been representative of the movements of predators rather than smolts. to incorporate predation effects into the resulting survival estimates, a suite of 11 summary migration metrics were compared between atlantic salmon smolts and striped bass (morone saxatilis). cluster analyses revealed that 2.4% to 13.6% of tags implanted in smolts exhibited migration patterns more similar to striped bass than to other smolts, which was interpreted here as evidence of predation. reassigning the fate of these tags as ""depredated-died"" reduced estimated survival from 43.5% to 41.1% in 2008 and from 32.6% to 19.0% in 2011 relative to a traditional mark-recapture model, illustrating the effect of predation bias in this case study."

red squirrel middens influence abundance but not diversity of other vertebrates,NA,PLOS ONE,POSTHUMUS EE;KOPROWSKI JL;STEIDL RJ,"some animals modify the environment in ways that can influence the resources available to other species. because red squirrels (tamiasciurus hudsonicus) create large piles of conifer-cone debris (middens) in which they store cones, squirrels concentrate resources that might affect biodiversity locally. to determine whether other animals are attracted to midden sites beyond their affinity for the same resources that attract red squirrels, we assessed associations between middens, mammals, and birds at population and community levels. we surveyed 75 middens where residency rates of red squirrels varied during the previous five years; sampling along this residency gradient permitted us to evaluate the influence of resources at middens beyond the influence of a resident squirrel. at each location, we quantified vegetation, landscape structure, abundance of conifer cones, and midden structure, and used capture-recapture, distance sampling, and remote cameras to quantify presence, abundance, and species richness of mammals and birds. red squirrels and the resources they concentrated at middens influenced mammals and birds at the population scale and to a lesser extent at the community scale. at middens with higher residency rates of red squirrels, richness of medium and large mammals increased markedly and species richness of birds increased slightly. after accounting for local forest characteristics, however, only species richness of medium-to-large mammals was associated with a red squirrel being resident during surveys. in areas where red squirrels were resident during surveys or in areas with greater amounts of resources concentrated by red squirrels, abundances of two of four small mammal species and two of four bird species increased. we conclude that the presence of this ecosystem modifier and the resources it concentrates influence abundance of some mammals and birds, which may have implications for maintaining biodiversity across the wide geographic range inhabited by red squirrels and other larderhoarding animals."
carbon (delta c-13) and nitrogen (delta n-15) stable isotope signatures in bat fur indicate swarming sites have catchment areas for bats from different summering areas,NA,PLOS ONE,SEGERS JL;BRODERS HG,"migratory patterns of bats are not well understood and traditional methods to study this, like capture-mark-recapture, may not provide enough detail unless there are many records. stable isotope profiles of many animal species have been used to make inferences about migration. each year myotis lucifugus and m. septentrionalis migrate from summering roosts to swarming caves and mines in the fall, but the pattern of movement between them is not well understood. in this study, fur delta c-13 and delta n-15 values of 305 m. lucifugus and 200 m. septentrionalis were analyzed to make inferences about migration patterns between summering areas and swarming sites in nova scotia, canada. we expected that there would be greater variability in delta c-13 and delta n-15 among individuals at swarming sites because it was believed that these sites are used by individuals originating from many summering areas. there was extensive overlap in the standard ellipse area, corrected for small sample sizes (sea(c)), of bats at swarming sites and much less overlap in sea(c) among groups sampled at summering areas. meaningful inference could not be made on m. septentrionalis because their low variation in sea(c) may have been the result of sampling only 3 summering areas. however, for m. lucifugus, swarming sites had larger sea(c) than summering areas and predictive discriminant analysis assigned swarming bats to multiple summering areas, supporting the contention that swarming bats are mixed aggregations of bats from several summering areas. together, these data support the contention that swarming sites have catchment areas for bats from multiple summering areas and it is likely that the catchment areas for swarming sites overlap. these data suggest that delta c-13 and delta n-15 profiling of bat fur offer some potential to make inferences about regional migration in bats."
do american dippers obtain a survival benefit from altitudinal migration?,NA,PLOS ONE,GREEN DJ;WHITEHORNE IBJ;MIDDLETON HA;MORRISSEY CA,"studies of partial migrants provide an opportunity to assess the cost and benefits of migration. previous work has demonstrated that sedentary american dippers (residents) have higher annual productivity than altitudinal migrants that move to higher elevations to breed. here we use a ten-year (30 period) mark-recapture dataset to evaluate whether migrants offset their lower productivity with higher survival during the migration-breeding period when they occupy different habitat, or early and late-winter periods when they coexist with residents. mark-recapture models provide no evidence that apparent monthly survival of migrants is higher than that of residents at any time of the year. the best-supported model suggests that monthly survival is higher in the migration-breeding period than winter periods. another well-supported model suggested that residency conferred a survival benefit, and annual apparent survival (calculated from model weighted monthly apparent survival estimates using the delta method) of residents (0.511 +/- 0.038se) was slightly higher than that of migrants (0.487 +/- 0.032). winter survival of american dippers was influenced by environmental conditions; monthly apparent survival increased as maximum daily flow rates increased and declined as winter temperatures became colder. however, we found no evidence that environmental conditions altered differences in winter survival of residents and migrants. since migratory american dippers have lower productivity and slightly lower survival than residents our data suggests that partial migration is likely an outcome of competition for limited nest sites at low elevations, with less competitive individuals being forced to migrate to higher elevations in order to breed."
functional responses of retaliatory killing versus recreational sport hunting of leopards in south africa,NA,PLOS ONE,SWANEPOEL LH;SOMERS MJ;DALERUM F,"predation strategies in response to altering prey abundances can dramatically influence the demographic effects of predation. despite this, predation strategies of humans are rarely incorporated into quantitative assessments of the demographic impacts of humans killing carnivores. this scarcity largely seems to be caused by a lack of data. in this study, we contrasted predation strategies exhibited by people involved in retaliatory killing and recreational sport hunting of leopards (panthera pardus) in the waterberg district municipality, south africa. we predicted a specialist predation strategy exemplified by a type ii functional response for retaliatory killing, and a generalist strategy exemplified by a type iii functional response for recreational sport hunting. we could not distinguish between a type i, a type ii, or a type iii functional response for retaliatory killing, but the most parsimonious model for recreational sport hunting corresponded to a type i functional response. kill rates were consistently higher for retaliatory killing than for recreational sport hunting. our results indicate that retaliatory killing of leopards may have severe demographic consequences for leopard populations, whereas the demographic consequences of recreational sport hunting likely are less dramatic."
experimental island invasion of house mice,bottleneck; carrying capacity; founder; incursion; logistic; mus musculus,POPULATION ECOLOGY,NATHAN HW;CLOUT MN;MACKAY JWB;MURPHY EC;RUSSELL JC,"the ability of invasive species to recurrently establish populations from small numbers of founders, while threatened species struggle at the same low population sizes, is a paradox in conservation biology. little is known about the mechanisms contributing to the post-arrival success of low density invasive populations as most invasive species research focuses on established, high density populations. experimental studies are powerful, but generally limited to laboratory or invertebrate experiments. here, we experimentally demonstrate that vertebrate mammal invasion from a very small (n = 2) number of founders follows relatively simple deterministic predictions. an intentional island invasion of introduced house mice (mus musculus linnaeus) from one founding pair closely tracked the density dependent logistic growth curve and reached the seasonal carrying capacity of a previously extant population in only 5 months. carrying capacity reflected both density dependent and independent processes. in contrast to the previously incumbent population, the invading population retained a marked genetic signal of its recent founder event, but the populations were otherwise demographically indistinguishable. stochastic events such as individual variability, supplemental immigration and ecological release, but not allee effects, played important roles during colonisation, but following establishment dynamics rapidly became deterministic, with little demographic impact of reduced genetic diversity. the small population paradigm appears to have little influence on the population dynamics of highly successful invasive species."
demography and mobility of three common understory butterfly species from tropical rain forest of papua new guinea,jolly-seber; lepidoptera; mark-release-recapture; melanesia; papilionoidea,POPULATION ECOLOGY,VLASANEK P;NOVOTNY V,"the mobility of butterflies determines their ability to find host plant species, and thus their potential host plant range, as well as their ability to maintain meta-populations in fragmented habitats. while butterfly movement has been extensively studied for temperate species, very little is known for tropical forest species. a mark-release-recapture study of the three most common butterfly species in the understory of a lowland primary rainforest in papua new guinea included 3,705, 394 and 317 marked individuals of danis danis, taenaris sp. and parthenos aspila respectively, with 1,031, 78 and 40 butterfly individuals recaptured at least once. over a period of 6 weeks there were almost 22,000 individuals belonging to these three species hatching within or entering our four study plots totaling 14.58 ha in area. the most abundant species, d. danis, with 20,000 individuals, showed highly variable population densities during the study. the residency time in the studied plots was highest for p. aspila (84 days), as individual butterflies stayed mostly in a single gap; we estimated that less than 1 % of individuals disperse 1 km or more. similar movement probability was found in d. danis whilst in taenaris sp., 10 % of the population disperses a parts per thousand yen1 km. movement distances of d. danis were more than sufficient to locate its host plant, derris elliptica, which occurred in 61 % of the 20 x 20 m subplots within a 50 ha plot. compared with temperate species, our three species have much longer life spans, but their movement patterns remain within the known mobility estimates of temperate species. the mobility of d. danis is close to the average for temperate lycaenidae, while taenaris sp. is more mobile and p. aspila less mobile than the mean for all temperate species."
abundance and demography of bottlenose dolphins inhabiting a subtropical estuary in the southwestern atlantic ocean,abundance; bottlenose dolphin; mark-recapture; power analysis; sex ratio; survival; tursiops truncatus,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,FRUET PF;DAURA JORGE FG;MOLLER LM;GENOVES RC;SECCHI ER,"we conducted a mark-recapture (mr) analysis from 8 years (2005-2012) of photo-identification data collected systematically to investigate demographic parameters of a community of bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the patos lagoon estuary and adjacent marine coast in southern brazil. under the most parsimonious model of pollock's robust design, which disregarded the effects of temporary emigration, the estimate of annual apparent survival was higher for adult females (0.97, 95% ci: 0.91-0.99) than for adult males (0.88, 95% ci: 0.75-0.94) and juveniles (0.83, 95% ci: 0.64-0.93), which may explain an observed bias in sex ratio (1 male:2 females) of known adult dolphins in this community. an increase in abundance of marked individuals was observed during the first 6 years of sampling when the number of new recruits surpassed mortality, followed by a remarkable decrease in the last 2 years when an inverse ratio of recruits/deaths occurred. yearly changes in abundance ((lambda) over cap (t)) varied from -0.1 to 0.07. total abundance estimates were highly precise (the highest coefficient of variation was 0.053) and did not exceed 88 individuals. abundance estimates were similar to a previous mr study conducted in the same area almost a decade earlier, suggesting a relative stable dolphin community over the last 14 years. the apparent stability in abundance, however, should be viewed with caution since this community would need a substantial mortality of at least 10% before a decline in abundance is detected with a desirable statistical power of 90%."
integrating citizen-science data with movement models to estimate the size of a migratory golden eagle population,aquila chrysaetos canadensis; citizen-science; golden eagle; hawk-count data; mark-recapture; raptor migration,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,DENNHARDT AJ;DUERR AE;BRANDES D;KATZNER TE,"estimating population size is fundamental to conservation and management. population size is typically estimated using survey data, computer models, or both. some of the most extensive and often least expensive survey data are those collected by citizen-scientists. a challenge to citizen-scientists is that the vagility of many organisms can complicate data collection. as a result, animal-movement effects on data collection can adversely affect modeling of those data. thus, it would be helpful to develop methods that integrate citizen-science datasets with models that account for animal movement. we used hawk-count data collected by citizen-scientists to estimate the number of golden eagles (aquila chrysaetos canadensis) migrating through pennsylvania, usa. to do this, we designed a computer model to simulate migratory flights of eagles to estimate what proportion of the population is available (i.e., within visible range or close enough) to be counted at hawk-count sites in pennsylvania. we then conducted a multi-state mark-recapture analysis to estimate detection probability (i.e., the rate at which birds within visible range are observed) of migrating eagles. finally, we used availability rates and detection probabilities to adjust raw hawk-count data to produce estimates of population size. our models suggest that 24% (+/- 14; mean +/- se) of migrating golden eagles are available to be counted at hawk-count sites, and that 55% (+/- 1.6) of the available eagles are detected by hawk-count observers. we estimate that 5122 (+/- 1338) golden eagles migrate annually through pennsylvania. our analysis provides the first quantitative estimate of the size of the eastern golden eagle population, and we demonstrate the utility of one approach to use citizen-science data to address a pressing, conservation goal-population size estimation.

"watershed-scale effectiveness of floodplain habitat restoration for juvenile coho salmon in the chilliwack river, british columbia",NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,OGSTON L;GIDORA S;FOY M;ROSENFELD J,"although billions of dollars have been spent restoring degraded watersheds worldwide, watershed-scale studies evaluating their effectiveness are rare. to mitigate damage from past logging activities, the floodplain of the upper chilliwack river watershed (similar to 600 km(2)) was extensively restored from 1996 to 2000 through off-channel habitat restoration. the contribution of restored habitat to watershed-scale production of wild coho (oncorhynchus kisutch) smolts was estimated through an extensive mark-recapture program in 2002. 27%-34% of the production of the estimated 247 200 out-migrating coho smolts could be attributed to the 157 000 m(2) of newly created habitat. area-based habitat models from the literature performed reasonably well in predicting smolt production from restored habitat, providing an acceptable first-order approach for evaluating production benefits of restoration. the costs of smolt production integrated over 30 years ranged from us$0.69-us$10.05 per smolt, falling within the range of hatchery production costs reported elsewhere (typical cost of similar to us$1.00 per smolt) at the most cost-effective restoration sites. this study demonstrates that large-scale habitat restoration can effectively enhance fish production at a watershed scale, at a cost that may be comparable to hatchery smolt production."
predicting bobcat abundance at a landscape scale and evaluating occupancy as a density index in central wisconsin,bobcat; detection probability; distribution-density relationships; lynx rufus; population estimate; spatially explicit capture-recapture; trail cameras; wisconsin,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,CLARE JDJ;ANDERSON EM;MACFARLAND DM,"the abundance of low-density species like carnivores is logistically difficult to directly estimate at a meaningful scale. predictive distribution models are often used as a surrogate for density estimation. but because density can continue to increase as occupancy asymptotes at 1, occupancy may have little value as an index, and home range expansion in marginal habitat may further confound the association. we sought to estimate bobcat population size at a landscape scale (14,286km(2)) in central wisconsin, which provided an opportunity to relate predicted occurrence to individual space use and population density. we sampled bobcats using motion-sensitive trail cameras at 9 arrays across central wisconsin. we estimated bobcat site-specific occupancy, and regressed these estimates as linear or asymptotic functions of site-specific density to determine the strength and shape of their association. we subsequently modeled both parameters relative to habitat covariates and repeated the regression process. a linear functional relationship between density and occupancy was most supported when detection parameters were held constant (w(i)=0.97, r-2=0.72) and when detection, occurrence, and density were modeled as a function of habitat covariates (w(i)=0.99, r-2=0.95). this suggests that repeated presence-absence data alone may be an efficient and reliable method for inferring spatial patterns in bobcat density or identifying habitat types with greater density potential in the northern parts of its range. bobcat occupancy and density were both positively associated with surrounding woody cover and wetland edge density. our most supported spatially explicit capture-recapture model estimated bobcat abundance as 362 adult individuals (95% ci 272-490) across the study area.

(a.) glaciegenita inhabiting a site in the nw alps (2,100-2,300 m) with e. (a.) provincialis occurring in the mediterranean biogeographical region in hilly dry grasslands (700 m). to describe patterns of dispersal, we applied the virtual migration model (vmm) to data collected using mark-release-recapture (mrr). we used parameters of survival and migration to explore metapopulation characteristics. in particular we investigated the relative role of connectivity and patch quality in affecting migration rates. we observed differences between the two metapopulation systems, with the ""alpine"" population occurring at higher altitude and in more open habitats, showing lower dispersal propensity. in contrast, even though the ""mediterranean"" population is more prone to disperse, migration appears to have higher costs. dispersal abilities affect metapopulation dynamics, which are at the basis of long-term perspectives of survival for butterfly populations. we discuss our results in the framework of conservation and management options for habitats occupied by these italian taxa of the e. aurinia complex."
estimating population density from presence-absence data using a spatially explicit model,abundance; bayesian analysis; camera traps; detection; non-detection; mcmc; red fox; spatial model; vulpes vulpes,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,RAMSEY DSL;CALEY PA;ROBLEY A,"presence-absence (detection/non-detection) data are routinely collected in wildlife studies where identification of individuals is impossible or impractical and where the detection method may be able to detect only the presence of an individual rather than a count (e.g., track or scat surveys). estimating population density from presence-absence data usually is assumed to be difficult or impossible unless certain restrictive assumptions are made or supplementary information is collected. recently, chandler and royle (2013) presented an extension of a spatially explicit capture-recapture model that estimates population density from spatially replicated counts in unmarked populations. we extended the model of chandler and royle (2013) to situations where only presence-absence data can be collected. the model assumes that individuals can be detected at multiple sample units, producing spatially correlated detections. a spatially explicit model of the detection process is then fit to the correlated detection data using bayesian methods. we report on the performance of the model using simulation and illustrate its use with a practical example estimating the abundance and density of red foxes (vulpes vulpes) from remote camera surveys in the grampians national park in southeastern australia. results from simulations suggest the model produces unbiased estimates of density if device spacing is less than the radial length of a typical home range and the number of encounter occasions is high (i.e., at least 10). application of the model to camera detection data from foxes in the grampians national park resulted in an estimated density of 0.22foxes/km(2) (95% ci: 0.16-0.53). for this dataset, precision of the density and detection parameter estimates were increased by the use of an informative prior distribution for the home-range-scale parameter. the current model should apply widely to a range of sampling situations that result in spatially correlated detection/non-detection data such as bait take, scat surveys, tracking stations, and chew cards, to name a few.

mark-recapture and mark-resight methods for estimating abundance with remote cameras: a carnivore case study,NA,PLOS ONE,ALONSO RS;MCCLINTOCK BT;LYREN LM;BOYDSTON EE;CROOKS KR,"abundance estimation of carnivore populations is difficult and has prompted the use of non-invasive detection methods, such as remotely-triggered cameras, to collect data. to analyze photo data, studies focusing on carnivores with unique pelage patterns have utilized a mark-recapture framework and studies of carnivores without unique pelage patterns have used a mark-resight framework. we compared mark-resight and mark-recapture estimation methods to estimate bobcat (lynx rufus) population sizes, which motivated the development of a new ""hybrid"" mark-resight model as an alternative to traditional methods. we deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the urban southern california study area. additionally, we physically captured and marked a subset of the bobcat population with gps telemetry collars. since we could identify individual bobcats with photos of unique pelage patterns and a subset of the population was physically marked, we were able to use traditional mark-recapture and mark-resight methods, as well as the new ""hybrid"" mark-resight model we developed to estimate bobcat abundance. we recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights and physically marked 27 bobcats with gps telemetry collars. abundance estimates produced by the traditional mark-recapture, traditional mark-resight, and ""hybrid"" mark-resight methods were similar, however precision differed depending on the models used. traditional mark-recapture and mark-resight estimates were relatively imprecise with percent confidence interval lengths exceeding 100% of point estimates. hybrid mark-resight models produced better precision with percent confidence intervals not exceeding 57%. the increased precision of the hybrid mark-resight method stems from utilizing the complete encounter histories of physically marked individuals (including those never detected by a camera trap) and the encounter histories of naturally marked individuals detected at camera traps. this new estimator may be particularly useful for estimating abundance of uniquely identifiable species that are difficult to sample using camera traps alone."
territory tenure increases with repertoire size in brownish-flanked bush warbler,NA,PLOS ONE,XIA CW;WEI CT;ZHANG YY,"song repertoire size is often cited as a classic example of a secondary sexual trait in birds. models of sexual selection and empirical tests of their predictions have often related secondary sexual traits to longevity. however, the relationship between repertoire size and longevity is unclear. using capture-mark-recapture studies in two populations of the brownish-flanked bush warbler cettia fortipes, we found that males with a repertoire size of three maintained territory tenure for a longer duration than did males with a repertoire size of two. these results provide evidence that even a minimal difference in repertoire size can serve as a potential signal of territory tenure capability."
mixture models for distance sampling detection functions,NA,PLOS ONE,MILLER DL;THOMAS L,"we present a new class of models for the detection function in distance sampling surveys of wildlife populations, based on finite mixtures of simple parametric key functions such as the half-normal. the models share many of the features of the widely-used ""key function plus series adjustment"" (k+a) formulation: they are flexible, produce plausible shapes with a small number of parameters, allow incorporation of covariates in addition to distance and can be fitted using maximum likelihood. one important advantage over the k+a approach is that the mixtures are automatically monotonic non-increasing and non-negative, so constrained optimization is not required to ensure distance sampling assumptions are honoured. we compare the mixture formulation to the k+a approach using simulations to evaluate its applicability in a wide set of challenging situations. we also re-analyze four previously problematic real-world case studies. we find mixtures outperform k+a methods in many cases, particularly spiked line transect data (i.e., where detectability drops rapidly at small distances) and larger sample sizes. we recommend that current standard model selection methods for distance sampling detection functions are extended to include mixture models in the candidate set."
demographics of the disappearing bottlenose dolphin in argentina: a common species on its way out?,NA,PLOS ONE,VERMEULEN E;BRAGER S,"populations of the once common bottlenose dolphin (tursiops truncatus) in argentina have precipitously declined throughout the country in the past decades. unfortunately, local declines of common species are easily overlooked when establishing priorities for conservation. in this study, demographics of what may well be the last remaining resident population in the country were assessed using mark-recapture analysis (pollock's robust design) of a photo-identification dataset collected during 2006-2011 in bahia san antonio (patagonia, argentina). total abundance, corrected for unmarked individuals, ranged from 40 (95% ci: 16.1-98.8) to 83 (95% ci = 45.8-151.8) individuals and showed a decrease over the years. adult survival rates varied between 0.97 (+/- 0.037 se) and 0.99 (+/- 0.010 se). average calving interval equalled 3.5 +/- 1.03 years, with 3.5 births/year in the entire population and a minimum annual birth rate of 4.2%. however, data suggest that calves may have been born and lost before being documented, underestimating birth rate, calf mortality, and possibly the number of reproductive females. either way, the recruitment rate of calves appears to be insufficient to support the size of the population. this population is relatively small and declining. considering the disappearance of populations north and south of the study area, an incessant decline will have severe consequences for the continuous existence of this species in argentina, indicating an urgent need for serious conservation efforts. this study provides insight into how the failure to recognize local population declines can threaten the national (and eventually the international) status of a common species like the bottlenose dolphin."
partitioning detectability components in populations subject to within-season temporary emigration using binomial mixture models,NA,PLOS ONE,O DONNELL KM;THOMPSON FR;SEMLITSCH RD,"detectability of individual animals is highly variable and nearly always < 1; imperfect detection must be accounted for to reliably estimate population sizes and trends. hierarchical models can simultaneously estimate abundance and effective detection probability, but there are several different mechanisms that cause variation in detectability. neglecting temporary emigration can lead to biased population estimates because availability and conditional detection probability are confounded. in this study, we extend previous hierarchical binomial mixture models to account for multiple sources of variation in detectability. the state process of the hierarchical model describes ecological mechanisms that generate spatial and temporal patterns in abundance, while the observation model accounts for the imperfect nature of counting individuals due to temporary emigration and false absences. we illustrate our model's potential advantages, including the allowance of temporary emigration between sampling periods, with a case study of southern red-backed salamanders plethodon serratus. we fit our model and a standard binomial mixture model to counts of terrestrial salamanders surveyed at 40 sites during 3-5 surveys each spring and fall 2010-2012. our models generated similar parameter estimates to standard binomial mixture models. aspect was the best predictor of salamander abundance in our case study; abundance increased as aspect became more northeasterly. increased time-since-rainfall strongly decreased salamander surface activity (i.e. availability for sampling), while higher amounts of woody cover objects and rocks increased conditional detection probability (i.e. probability of capture, given an animal is exposed to sampling). by explicitly accounting for both components of detectability, we increased congruence between our statistical modeling and our ecological understanding of the system. we stress the importance of choosing survey locations and protocols that maximize species availability and conditional detection probability to increase population parameter estimate reliability."
"ecological, evolutionary and social constraints on reproductive effort: are hoary marmots really biennial breeders?",NA,PLOS ONE,PATIL VP;KARELS TJ;HIK DS,"biennial breeding is a rare life-history trait observed in animal species living in harsh, unproductive environments. this reproductive pattern is thought to occur in 10 of 14 species in the genus marmota, making marmots useful model organisms for studying its ecological and evolutionary implications. biennial breeding in marmots has been described as an obligate pattern which evolved as a mechanism to mitigate the energetic costs of reproduction (evolved constraint hypothesis). however, recent anecdotal evidence suggests that it is a facultative pattern controlled by annual variation in climate and food availability (environmental constraint hypothesis). finally, in social animals like marmots, biennial breeding could result from reproductive competition between females within social groups (social constraint hypothesis). we evaluated these three hypotheses using mark-recapture data from an 8-year study of hoary marmot (marmota caligata) population dynamics in the yukon. annual variation in breeding probability was modeled using multi-state markrecapture models, while other reproductive life-history traits were modeled with generalized linear mixed models. hoary marmots were neither obligate nor facultative biennial breeders, and breeding probability was insensitive to evolved, environmental, or social factors. however, newly mature females were significantly less likely to breed than older individuals. annual breeding did not result in increased mortality. female survival and, to a lesser extent, average fecundity were correlated with winter climate, as indexed by the pacific decadal oscillation. hoary marmots are less conservative breeders than previously believed, and the evidence for biennial breeding throughout marmota, and in other arctic/alpine/antarctic animals, should be re-examined. prediction of future population dynamics requires an accurate understanding of life history strategies, and of how life history traits allow animals to cope with changes in weather and other demographic influences."

covariates of release mortality and tag loss in large-scale tuna tagging experiments,mark-recapture; post-release mortality; electronic tags; conventional tags; oxytetracycline; tag shedding,FISHERIES RESEARCH,HOYE SD;LEROY BM;NICOL SJ;HAMPTON WJ,"the data from tag-recapture experiments, which are used to help understand animal behaviour and dynamics, and to provide input data for population models such as stock assessments, are affected by mortality associated with tagging and by tag shedding. these processes introduce bias and uncertainty into parameters estimated in population models such as tuna stock assessments. the causes and magnitudes of tag shedding and post-release mortality in tuna tagging experiments are not well understood. we analysed data from tuna tagging experiments in the western pacific (330,000 releases) and indian oceans (168,000 releases) to investigate factors affecting post-release mortality and tag shedding. tag return rates were modelled as functions of the tagger identity, tagger experience, tagging assistant, tagging station, treatment of the fish, use of oxytetracycline, ulna species, and size at release. the release event was included in models as a fixed effect, so that differences in recapture rate among release events did not affect other parameter estimates. we found differences in tag return rates among taggers and tagging assistants, with tagger experience, and between tagging stations. substantially lower return rates were associated with some types of damage to fish and with internally implanted tags, and when oxytetracycline was injected. return rates varied with tuna size and species. in the western pacific yellowfin and bigeye return rates were more affected by some covariates than were skipjack, while differences were not observed in the indian ocean, where sample sizes were smaller. results suggest that tagging mortality may be quite high, and that more care and better recording of fish treatment would increase the reliability of assessment inputs. we provide new effective release numbers that have been adjusted to allow for estimated tagging mortality and tag shedding.

evaluation of tag mixing assumptions in western pacific ocean skipjack tuna stock assessment models,mark-recapture; tag mixing; stock assessment; diffusion; skipjack,FISHERIES RESEARCH,KOLODY D;HOYLE S,"fish population estimators (for abundance, mortality and movement) from conventional tagging (mark-recapture) programmes require the assumption that tagged individuals are equally vulnerable to recapture as the (relevant portion of the) untagged population. most commercial tuna species are distributed over millions of square km, with poorly understood stock structure and movement dynamics, while tags tend to be released in much smaller areas that are selected for logistical reasons. if the tags do not mix sufficiently with the general population this could substantially bias tuna stock assessments. we outline two simple quantitative methods for evaluating tag mixing, and apply them to western pacific ocean skipjack tuna (katsuwonis pelamis). the first approach compares, in a discrete time window, the spatial distributions of tag recoveries from pairs of release events that were separated in space and/or time. significant differences between the recovery distributions indicate that tags from the two release events are not fully mixed with each other, such that one or both release events cannot be fully mixed with the general population either. the second approach tests whether tag density (number of recovered tags per unit of catch) is spatially homogeneous for an individual release event. both tests focus on detecting incomplete mixing and neither can prove that full mixing has been achieved. the analyses provide strong evidence that tag mixing assumptions are not being met in recent western pacific skipjack tuna stock assessments. simple diffusion models were fit to the tag density observations and used to simulate the potential magnitude of mixing biases using simple estimators for abundance and natural and fishing mortality. options for reformulating the skipjack assessment are discussed.

length-based brownie mark-recapture models: derivation and application to indian ocean skipjack tuna,length-based; mark-recapture; brownie model; skipjack tuna,FISHERIES RESEARCH,HILLARY RM;EVESON JP,"standard brownie mark-recapture models follow tagged cohorts of fish meaning an age-based setting is required, but there are many populations for which length-at-age cannot be characterised. this paper details the derivation of a length-based brownie mark-recapture model, with specific application to indian ocean skipjack tuna. instead of following cohorts (often tagged a number of times) the model follows the recapture history of animals tagged in a given length class and period. for indian ocean skipjack reporting rate uncertainty, related to mixing assumptions, is accounted for using two extreme options. various mortality model structures were explored and length-specific natural mortality and a separable model for fishing mortality were ultimately selected. absolute values of fishing and natural mortality depend strongly on the reporting rate assumptions, with total mortality being far more robust to assumptions about reporting rates. estimates of fishing mortality were highest between mid 2006 and mid 2008, reducing thereafter to levels estimated in late 2005/early 2006.

the lyme disease pathogen has no effect on the survival of its rodent reservoir host,NA,PLOS ONE,VOORDOUW MJ;LACHISH S;DOLAN MC,"zoonotic pathogens that cause devastating morbidity and mortality in humans may be relatively harmless in their natural reservoir hosts. the tick-borne bacterium borrelia burgdorferi causes lyme disease in humans but few studies have investigated whether this pathogen reduces the fitness of its reservoir hosts under natural conditions. we analyzed four years of capture-mark-recapture (cmr) data on a population of white-footed mice, peromyscus leucopus, to test whether b. burgdorferi and its tick vector affect the survival of this important reservoir host. we used a multi-state cmr approach to model mouse survival and mouse infection rates as a function of a variety of ecologically relevant explanatory factors. we found no effect of b. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of p. leucopus. our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of lyme disease in the northeastern united states. b. burgdorferi establishes a chronic avirulent infection in their rodent reservoir hosts because this pathogen depends on rodent mobility to achieve transmission to its sedentary tick vector. the estimates of b. burgdorferi infection risk will facilitate future theoretical studies on the epidemiology of lyme disease."

a forest-grassland boundary enhances patch quality for a grassland-dwelling butterfly as revealed by dispersal processes,metapopulation; fragmentation; connectivity; mark-recapture; population parameter,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,AKEBOSHI A;TAKAGI S;MURAKAMI M;HASEGAWA M;MIYASHITA T,"although patch isolation and patch size have long been considered the two primary parameters affecting metapopulation processes, patch quality is now recognized as a third factor. the extent to which patch quality influences between-patch migration processes and local population sizes, however, is poorly understood. using a mark-recapture survey for the butterfly minois dryas, which inhabits grasslands in a fragmented landscape, we investigated factors affecting immigration and emigration of female individuals between patches. for patch quality, we assessed the proportion of forest-edge length along the patch periphery, as well as nectar resource availability, as the former is known to provide shelter from heat stress for grassland butterflies in midsummer. results revealed that immigration into patches was largely determined by patch quality represented by forest-grassland adjacency, in addition to patch isolation. emigration was lower from patches with high-quality measured by nectar resource availability as well as the amount of surrounding forest. these results suggest that a forest-grassland boundary is important, even for grassland-dwelling butterflies, in fragmented landscapes, and that conservation priorities should be given to habitats having this structural feature, as well as large patch size and high connectivity."
integrated survival analysis using an event-time approach in a bayesian framework,charadrius montanus; continuous time; detection probability; event time; hazard rate; mountain plover; simulation; survival; unknown fate,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,WALSH DP;DREITZ VJ;HEISEY DM,"event-time or continuous-time statistical approaches have been applied throughout the biostatistical literature and have led to numerous scientific advances. however, these techniques have traditionally relied on knowing failure times. this has limited application of these analyses, particularly, within the ecological field where fates of marked animals may be unknown. to address these limitations, we developed an integrated approach within a bayesian framework to estimate hazard rates in the face of unknown fates. we combine failure/survival times from individuals whose fates are known and times of which are interval-censored with information from those whose fates are unknown, and model the process of detecting animals with unknown fates. this provides the foundation for our integrated model and permits necessary parameter estimation. we provide the bayesian model, its derivation, and use simulation techniques to investigate the properties and performance of our approach under several scenarios. lastly, we apply our estimation technique using a piece-wise constant hazard function to investigate the effects of year, age, chick size and sex, sex of the tending adult, and nesting habitat on mortality hazard rates of the endangered mountain plover (charadrius montanus) chicks. traditional models were inappropriate for this analysis because fates of some individual chicks were unknown due to failed radio transmitters. simulations revealed biases of posterior mean estimates were minimal ( 4.95%), and posterior distributions behaved as expected with rmse of the estimates decreasing as sample sizes, detection probability, and survival increased. we determined mortality hazard rates for plover chicks were highest at <5days old and were lower for chicks with larger birth weights and/or whose nest was within agricultural habitats. based on its performance, our approach greatly expands the range of problems for which event-time analyses can be used by eliminating the need for having completely known fate data."
move it or lose it: movement and mortality of sablefish tagged in alaska,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,HANSELMAN DH;HEIFETZ J;ECHAVE KB;DRESSEL SC,"a basic step in understanding the dynamics of a fish population is to quantify movement and mortality rates. conventional mark-recapture experiments have provided the foundation for studies on animal movement, particularly for fish. previous studies have shown rapid mixing of sablefish (anoplopoma fimbria) among fishery regulatory areas, with the pattern of movement related to fish size. over 300 000 tag releases in alaska and over 27 000 tag recoveries from 1979 to 2009 were analyzed. we used a markov model to quantify annual movement probabilities among areas for three size groups of sablefish. the negative-binomial likelihood was used to model the tag-recovery data because of significant overdispersion. annual movement probabilities were high, ranging from 10% to 88% depending on area of occupancy at each time step and size group. overall, movement probabilities were very different between areas of occupancy and moderately different between size groups. estimated annual movement of small sablefish from the central gulf of alaska had the reverse pattern of a previous study, with 29% moving westward and 39% moving eastward. movement probabilities also varied annually, with decreasing movement until the late 1990s and increasing movement until 2009. year-specific magnitude in movement probability of large fish was highly negatively correlated with female spawning biomass estimates from the federal stock assessment. mean mortality estimates from time at liberty were similar to the federal stock assessment. incorporating these tag-recovery and movement data into a fully age-structured spatial stock assessment model will inform harvest apportionment strategies to conserve spawning biomass and maximize future yields."
estimating cumulative exposure of wildlife to non-lethal disturbance using spatially explicit capture-recapture models,cumulative effects; encounter intensity; encounter probability; habitat use; marine mammal; minke whale; photo-id; spatial ecology; tourism impact,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,CHRISTIANSEN F;BERTULLI CG;RASMUSSEN MH;LUSSEAU D,"impact assessments often focus on short-term behavioral responses of animals to human disturbance. however, the cumulative effects caused by repeated behavioral disruptions are of management concern because these effects have the potential to influence individuals' survival and reproduction. we need to estimate individual exposure rates to disturbance to determine cumulative effects. we present a new approach to estimate the spatial exposure of minke whales to whalewatching boats in faxafloi bay, iceland. we used recent advances in spatially explicit capture-recapture modeling to estimate the probability that whales would encounter a disturbance (i.e., whalewatching boat). we obtained spatially explicit individual encounter histories of individually identifiable animals using photo-identification. we divided the study area into 1-km(2) grid cells and considered each cell a spatially distinct sampling unit. we used capture history of individuals to model and estimate spatial encounter probabilities of individual minke whales across the study area, accounting for heterogeneity in sampling effort. we inferred the exposure of individual minke whales to whalewatching vessels throughout the feeding season by estimating individual whale encounters with vessels using the whale encounter probabilities and spatially explicit whalewatching intensity in the same area, obtained from recorded whalewatching vessel tracks. we then estimated the cumulative time whales spent with whalewatching boats to assess the biological significance of whalewatching disturbances. the estimated exposure levels to boats varied considerably between individuals because of both temporal and spatial variations in the activity centers of whales and the whalewatching intensity in the area. however, although some whales were repeatedly exposed to whalewatching boats throughout the feeding season, the estimated cumulative time they spent with boats was very low. although whalewatching boat interactions caused feeding disruptions for the whales, the estimated low cumulative exposure indicated that the whalewatching industry in its current state likely is not having any long-term negative effects on vital rates.

costs and benefits of late nesting in cliff swallows,cliff swallow; cost of reproduction; ectoparasites; fecundity; life history; petrochelidon pyrrhonota; reproductive phenology; survival; time of breeding,OECOLOGIA,BROWN CR;ROCHE EA;O BRIEN VA,"many organisms of temperate latitudes exhibit declines in reproductive success as the breeding season advances. experiments can delay the onset of reproduction for early breeders to investigate the consequences of late nesting, but it is rarely possible to observe a distinct second round of nesting in species that normally nest only once. the colonial cliff swallow (petrochelidon pyrrhonota) is a migratory songbird that has a relatively short breeding season in the western great plains, usa, with birds rarely nesting late in the summer. previous work suggested that ectoparasitism is a primary reason why reproductive success in this species declines over the summer. at colony sites where nests were fumigated to remove ectoparasitic swallow bugs (oeciacus vicarius), cliff swallows frequently undertook a distinct round of late nesting after previously fledging young that year. mark-recapture revealed that late-nesting pairs at these colonies produced fewer offspring that survived to the next breeding season, and that survival of late-nesting adults was lower during the next year, relative to pairs nesting earlier in the season. these reproductive costs applied in the absence of ectoparasites and likely reflect other environmental costs of late nesting such as seasonal declines in food availability or a delayed start of fall migration. despite the costs, the estimated fitness for perennial early-and-late nesters in the absence of ectoparasites was equivalent to that of birds that nested only early in the season. the collective disadvantages of late nesting likely constrain most cliff swallows to raising a single brood in the middle latitudes of north america."
female weddell seals show flexible strategies of colony attendance related to varying environmental conditions,animal movement; colony attendance; leptonychotes weddellii; life history; mark-recapture; ross sea; antarctica; sea-ice extent; seasonal migration; temporary emigration; unobservable state; weddell seal,ECOLOGY,CHAMBERT T;ROTELLA JJ;GARROTT RA,"many animal life cycles involve movements among different habitats to fulfill varying resource demands. there are inherent costs associated with such movements, and the decision to leave or stay at a given location ought to be motivated by the benefits associated with potential target habitats. because movement patterns, especially those associated with reproduction, can have important implications for the success (survival, reproduction) of individual animals, and therefore a population's dynamics, it is important to identify and understand their sources of variation (environmental and individual). here, using a mark-recapture, multistate modeling approach, we investigated a set of a priori hypotheses regarding sources and patterns of variation in breeding-colony attendance for weddell seal (leptonychotes weddellii) females on sabbatical from pup production. for such females, colony attendance might be motivated by predation avoidance and positive social interactions related to reproduction, but some costs, such as reduced foraging opportunities or aggressive interactions with conspecifics, might also exist. we expected these benefits and costs to vary with a female's condition and the environment. results revealed that the probability of being absent from colonies was higher (1) in years when the extent of local sea ice was larger, (2) for the youngest and oldest individuals, and (3) for females with less reproductive experience. we also found substantial levels of residual individual heterogeneity in these rates. based on our a priori predictions, we postulate that the decision to attend breeding colonies or not is directly influenced by an individual's physiological condition, as well as by the ice-covered distance to good foraging areas, availability of predator-free haul-out sites, and the level of negative interactions with conspecifics inside colonies. our results support the idea that in iteroparous species, and colonial animals in particular, seasonal and temporary movements from/to reproductive sites represent flexible behavioral strategies that can play an important role in coping with environmental variability."
improved models for predicting walleye abundance and setting safe harvest quotas in northern wisconsin lakes,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HANSEN GJA;HENNESSY JM;CICHOSZ TA;HEWETT SW,"in wisconsin, the management of walleyes sander vitreus relies on a set of log-linear regressions to predict walleye abundance and to set safe harvest. the regression models predict mean walleye abundance from lake area, but they ignore variability among years; they also predict equal walleye populations in lakes with the same size and recruitment source. we evaluated three alternative models in terms of predictive accuracy and the risk of overharvest. we used 899 mark-recapture population estimates (collected between 1953 and 2013) from 219 lakes to develop and evaluate (1) a log-linear mixed-effects model that used all individual observations and estimated adult walleye abundance from lake area and lake-specific deviations from the overall intercept; (2) a mixed-effects model that builds on model 1 by adding a linear fixed effect of sampling year; and (3) a mixed-effects model that builds on model 1 by adding a random year effect. walleye abundance was positively correlated with lake area in all models and was negatively correlated with sampling year (when included). alternative models improved predictive accuracy by 17-22% over the current regression model. restricting data to those collected during the most recent 20 years improved model responsiveness to new data and reduced the value of including a linear time trend. when all data were used for model construction, the relative risk of overharvest was lowest under the mixed-effects model with a linear time trend; when the most recent 20 years of data were used, the risk was lowest under the mixed-effects model with a random year effect. accounting for variability among years would allow harvest to track changing walleye populations and would allow management to be more adaptive. we recommend using the mixed-effects model with a random year effect and restricting the data inputs to the most recent 20 years."
the influence of individual fish characteristics on survival and detection: similarities across two salmonid species,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HOSTETTER NJ;EVANS AF;LOGE FJ;O CONNOR RR;CRAMER BM;FRYER D;COLLIS K,"trait-selective mortality is of considerable management and conservation interest, especially when trends are similar across multiple species of conservation concern. in the columbia river basin, thousands of juvenile pacific salmonids oncorhynchus spp. are collected each year and are tagged at juvenile bypass system (jbs) facilities located at hydroelectric dams, thus allowing the tracking of population-level performance metrics (e.g., juvenile survival and juvenile-to-adult survival). several studies have suggested that juvenile salmonid survival is both size dependent and condition dependent, but little is known about trait-selective collection at jbs facilities. trait-selective collection (e.g., length-based or condition-based selectivity) is particularly important, as inferences to population-level performance metrics may be biased if both the survival and collection processes are influenced by similar characteristics. we used a capture-mark-recapture study to investigate length-and condition-selective survival and detection probabilities for two salmonid species in the columbia river basin. in 2014, juvenile steelhead o. mykiss (n = 11,201) and yearling chinook salmon o. tshawytscha (n = 7,943) were pit-tagged, measured (fl), examined for external condition characteristics (descaling, body injuries, fin damage, or disease symptoms), and released into the lower granite dam jbs facility on the snake river to continue seaward migration. results indicated similar trends in both length-and condition-selective juvenile survival and detection probabilities. for both species, survival probability was higher for longer, nondegraded individuals (those without descaling, body injuries, or fin damage). trends in detection probability were also consistent across species: shorter, degraded individuals were more likely to be detected at downstream jbs facilities than longer, healthier individuals. these results suggest that similar characteristics (fl and external condition) affect survival and detection processes for pit-tagged steelhead and yearling chinook salmon and that jbs facilities may selectively collect smaller, degraded individuals with lower probabilities of survival. the consistency in trait-selective survival and detection results has important management implications for several species of conservation concern."
retention and stress effects of visible implant tags when marking western silvery minnow and its application to other cyprinids (family cyprinidae),NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,NEUFELD K;BLAIR S;POESCH M,"visible implant tags are commonly used in fisheries research to mark individuals or batches of fish as part of movement and mark-recapture studies. to be effective, these tags generally need to have high retention rates and little impact on the behavior or physiology of themarked individuals. we tested the retention rates of both visible implant elastomer (vie) and visible implant alphanumeric (via) tags in 80-139-mm western silvery minnow hybognathus argyritis over a 104-d period. we also measured plasma cortisol and lactate to determine the impact of tagging on stress levels. we found that vie tags had 100% retention and did not cause a significant increase in plasma cortisol levels, though plasma lactate levels were elevated in vie treatment groups. overall, vie tags were found to be suitable for marking western silvery minnow and similar species. visible implant alphanumeric tags had 36% retention over 104 d and did not cause significant increases in plasma cortisol, though plasma lactate was elevated in the treatment group with bothvie and via tags. given the high retention rates and low stress effects, vie tags appear to be more beneficial for use with western silvery minnow and similar-sized cyprinids."

"reproduction and survival of rodents in crop fields: the effects of rainfall, crop stage and stone-bund density",arvicanthis dembeensis; ethiopia; mastomys awashensis; pest control,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,MEHERETU Y;WELEGERIMA K;SLUYDTS V;BAUER H;GEBREHIWOT K;DECKERS J;MAKUNDI R;LEIRS H,"context. reproduction and survival are two of the most important demographic factors that play a major role in changing population abundances of pest species over time and space, solid understanding of which is a useful input to forecast future population changes for proactive management. aims. we investigated the effects of rainfall, crop-development stage and density of stone bunds on reproductive patterns, and the effects of stone-bund density and sex on survival probabilities of two widespread rodent species (mastomys awashensis and arvicanthis dembeensis) in ethiopian highlands. methods. rodent population dynamics were monitored from april 2007 to february 2011, using capture-mark-recapture (cmr) technique in four 60 x 60 m permanent square grids for four consecutive cropping seasons. two of the grids represented fields with low stone-bund density (lsbd, similar to 15m apart) and the other two represented fields with high stone-bund density (hsbd, similar to 10m apart). key results. reproduction was seasonal, commencing during the wet season following the rain and continuing through the early dry season. we found an increase in the abundance of reproductively active female individuals of both species towards the milky and fruiting crop stages and around harvest period. we found no strong difference in survival probability between the two rodent species with variation in stone-bund density and sex. conclusion. stone bunds play a minor role in the reproduction and survival of the rodent species at the observed abundances. implications. in terms of pest management, the high local survival rates estimated for both rodent species matter more than survival differences owing to variations in stone-bund density and sex."
density and home range of feral cats in north-western australia,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,MCGREGOR HW;LEGGE S;POTTS J;JONES ME;JOHNSON CN,"context. feral cats (felis catus) pose a significant threat to biodiversity in australia, and are implicated in current declines of small mammals in the savannas of northern australia. basic information on population density and ranging behaviour is essential to understand and manage threats from feral cats. aims. in this study, we provide robust estimates of density and home range of feral cats in the central kimberley region of north-western australia, and we test whether population density is affected by livestock grazing, small mammal abundance and other environmental factors. methods. densities were measured at six transects sampled between 2011 and 2013 using arrays of infrared cameras. cats were individually identified, and densities estimated using spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis. home range was measured from gps tracking of 32 cats. key results. densities were similar across all transects and deployments, with a mean of 0.18 cats km(-2) (range = 0.09-0.34 km(-2)). we found no evidence that population density was related to livestock grazing or abundance of small mammals. home ranges of males were, on average, 855 ha (+/- 156 ha (95% ci), n = 25), and those of females were half the size at 397 ha (+/- 275 ha (95% ci), n = 7). there was little overlap in ranges of cats of the same sex. conclusions. compared with elsewhere in australia outside of semiarid regions, feral cats occur at low density and have large home ranges in the central kimberley. however, other evidence shows that despite this low density, cats are contributing to declines of small mammal populations across northern australia. implications. it will be very difficult to reduce these already-sparse populations by direct control. instead, land-management practices that reduce the impacts of cats on prey should be investigated."
an evaluation of the efficiency of minnow traps for estimating the abundance of minnows in desert spring systems,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,PETERSON JT;SCHEERER PD;CLEMENTS S,"desert springs are sensitive aquatic ecosystems that pose unique challenges to natural resource managers and researchers. among the most important of these is the need to accurately quantify population parameters for resident fish, particularly when the species are of special conservation concern. we evaluated the efficiency of baited minnow traps for estimating the abundance of two at-risk species, foskett speckled dace rhinichthys osculus ssp. and borax lake chub gila boraxobius, in desert spring systems in southeastern oregon. we evaluated alternative sample designs using simulation and found that capture-recapture designs with four capture occasions would maximize the accuracy of estimates and minimize fish handling. we implemented the design and estimated capture and recapture probabilities using the huggins closed-capture estimator. trap capture probabilities averaged 23% and 26% for foskett speckled dace and borax lake chub, respectively, but differed substantially among sample locations, through time, and nonlinearly with fish body size. recapture probabilities for foskett speckled dace were, on average, 1.6 times greater than ( first) capture probabilities, suggesting ""trap-happy"" behavior. comparison of population estimates from the huggins model with the commonly used lincoln-petersen estimator indicated that the latter underestimated foskett speckled dace and borax lake chub population size by 48% and by 20%, respectively. these biases were due to variability in capture and recapture probabilities. simulation of fish monitoring that included the range of capture and recapture probabilities observed indicated that variability in capture and recapture probabilities in time negatively affected the ability to detect annual decreases by up to 20% in fish population size. failure to account for variability in capture and recapture probabilities can lead to poor quality data and study inferences. therefore, we recommend that fishery researchers and managers employ sample designs and estimators that can account for this variability."
estimating the riverine abundance of green sturgeon using a dual-frequency identification sonar,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,MORA EA;LINDLEY ST;ERICKSON DL;KLIMLEY AP,"to determine the total number of green sturgeon acipenser medirostris present in the rogue river, oregon, we compared plot sampling using a dual-frequency identification sonar (didson), a density-based estimation technique combining the number of individuals detected and the area sampled, to a concurrent mark-recapture estimate. using the didson-based method, we estimated the total abundance of green sturgeon to be 223 (95% confidence interval = 180-266). the mark-recapture method resulted in an estimate of 236 individuals (150-424). the noninvasive didson transect estimates resulted in tighter confidence intervals and required fewer technician hours to collect the data than did the mark- recapture method (37 h versus 232 h, respectively). precise estimates of the abundance and distribution of green sturgeon are important components to species recovery and management. thus, this new technique has the potential to greatly improve population monitoring and is an excellent tool to identify occupied habitats."
"shortnose sturgeon and atlantic sturgeon in the kennebec river system, maine: a 1977-2001 retrospective of abundance and important habitat",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,WIPPELHAUSER GS;SQUIERS TS,"little was known about the populations of shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum and atlantic sturgeon a. oxyrinchus in the kennebec, androscoggin, and sheepscot river estuaries (the kennebec system) in maine, prompting a series of field studies spanning the years 1977-2001. although the impetus for these studies varied, common objectives were to estimate population abundances and locate habitat important to the conservation of both species. during 16 years of gill-net sampling, we caught 3,372 shortnose sturgeon and 403 atlantic sturgeon. on the basis of two mark-recapture studies, the adult shortnose sturgeon population in the kennebec system was estimated to be 5,117 (95% confidence interval, 4,206-6,279) for the period 1977-1981 and 9,436 (7,542-11,888) for the period 1998-2000. gill-net sampling led to the identification of two spawning areas in the kennebec system. one was an approximately 0.7-km-long reach immediately downstream of brunswick dam in the androscoggin estuary, and the other was an approximately 26-km-long reach immediately downstream of edwards dam in the upper kennebec estuary. shortnose sturgeon were caught at both locations, while atlantic sturgeon were documented only in the upper kennebec estuary. acoustic telemetry was used to identify a wintering site in merrymeeting bay that was used by shortnose sturgeon."
"life, death, and resurrection: accounting for state uncertainty in survival estimation from tagged grass carp",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,STICH DS;JIAO Y;MURPHY BR,"information about grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella survival would be useful for improving the management of fish used for aquatic weed control. reliable methods for estimating annual poststocking survival of grass carp from radiotelemetry data do not exist because the fish remain sedentary for prolonged periods between movements, giving the false impression of death, only to be observed alive (i.e., ""resurrected"") at a later date. we constructed a state-space, multistate mark-recapture survival model accounting for uncertainty in the live/dead states of tagged grass carp in a large (8,500 ha) reservoir, and we estimated monthly and annual survival. model results were compared with life history-based methods for estimating survival, and survival estimates that were corrected for state misclassification were compared with uncorrected estimates. corrected estimates of annual survival (mean = 0.23; 95% credible interval [cri] d 0.15-0.41) contained less bias than uncorrected estimates (0.12; 95% cri = 0.08-0.18). however, both corrected and uncorrected estimates were substantially lower than the survival expected based on life history theory (mean d 0.69; 95% confidence interval d 0.52-0.78), suggesting that mark-recapture survival estimates for grass carp might be negatively biased due to tag shedding, tag-related mortality, or both. our model effectively reduced bias in monthly and annual survival estimates due to state misclassification, illustrating the potential for application of existing mark-recapture frameworks to estimate grass carp survival with telemetry data, despite the behavioral idiosyncrasies of the species. furthermore, these methods may have application for studies of other animals that undergo periodic quiescence between movements, such as salmonids, ictalurids, and reef fishes. to account for bias resulting from tag loss, future mark-recapture studies of grass carp could incorporate tag shedding rates within the framework developed here."
dynamics of endangered eastern cape breton atlantic salmon populations,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,GIBSON AJF;BOWLBY HD;LEVY AL,"the eastern cape breton (ecb) designable unit (du) of atlantic salmon salmo salar comprises populations in 46 or more rivers in the eastern portion of cape breton island, nova scotia, canada. in 2010, the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada classified the ecb du as endangered. in support of recovery planning processes, we developed an integrated, statistical, life history-based model for evaluating the dynamics of populations belonging to this du. using maximum likelihood, the model was fitted to recreational fishery catch and effort data, fish counts by divers, intermittent mark-recapture data, and sparse age composition data for two populations in the du. the model output included estimates of maximum lifetime reproductive rate ((alpha) over cap) and equilibrium population size-parameters that are important for determining extinction risk. the (alpha) over bar for the middle river population (2.82 spawners/spawner) was double that of the baddeck river population (1.39 spawners/spawner). these (alpha) over bar values would be considered low for atlantic salmon populations in general but are higher than those of populations in a neighboring endangered du to the south. slightly negative trends in recruitment deviates may indicate declining productivity in the two ecb populations; based on equilibrium analyses, neither population is expected to achieve the proposed recovery targets without an increase in productivity, survival, or both. atlantic salmon populations and habitat characteristics in ecb exhibit considerable diversity. therefore, the dynamics of the middle river and baddeck river populations are unlikely to be representative of all populations in the ecb du. based on recent trends in recreational fishery catches, these two populations are likely among the healthier populations within the du."
evaluating effects of exploitation on annual apparent mortality rates of paddlefish using mark-recapture data,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,PIERCE LL;GRAEB BDS;WILLIS DW;SORENSEN JS,"knowledge of the effects of exploitation on population dynamics is critical to effective conservation and management of fish populations. to improve our understanding of the effects of sport fishery exploitation on populations of paddlefish polyodon spathula, we tested eight additive and compensatory harvest mortality hypotheses for the paddlefish population in lake francis case (lfc), south dakota, with 33 years of tag recovery data using dead recovery models in program mark. we evaluated additive and compensatory harvest mortality hypotheses by modeling the effects of sport fishery closures on annual apparent survival and tag recovery rates. our most-supported hypotheses indicated that exploitation prior to the functional closure of the sport fishery (i.e., when exploitation became negligible) was an additive source of mortality. annual apparent mortality estimates (i.e., 1 - annual apparent survival) of our most-supported model decreased from 0.237 (se = 0.036) to 0.110 (se = 0.063) following the functional closure of the sport fishery and coincided with a decrease in recovery rate from 0.095 (se = 0.015) to 0.010 (se = 0.004). these results suggest that relatively unregulated sport fishery exploitation can substantially increase mortality rates of paddlefish populations. the effects of exploitation on mortality likely differ between populations and temporally within populations due to differences in density-dependent mortality rates."
reproductive strategy and carry-over effects for species with complex life histories,life history strategy; lithobates sylvatica; population dynamics; vernal pool; wood frog,POPULATION ECOLOGY,GREEN AW;BAILEY LL,"we investigated the influences of natal-pool and metamorph characteristics on juvenile survival, age-specific breeding probabilities, and dispersal of wood frogs (lithobates sylvatica) and used this information to infer how life history strategies of short-lived species may offset risks associated with breeding in highly variable habitats. we used multistate mark-recapture data from eight wood frog populations in maryland, usa, to investigate the influences of natal-pond and metamorph characteristics on post-metamorphic demographics. we found that post-metamorphic juvenile survival was highly variable and negatively influenced by abiotic conditions experienced during development but showed little relationship to larval density or size at metamorphosis. estimates of recruitment and dispersal probabilities indicated that males mature earlier than females, and a small percentage of each sex disperse to non-natal pools. survival probabilities for adults during the non-breeding season were less variable than juvenile rates, lower for females, and negatively related to mean monthly precipitation. survival of adults during the breeding season was generally very high. we provide the first robust estimates of post-metamorphic vital rates of wood frogs that allow for variation in capture probabilities. we found little evidence for an effect of metamorph traits on juvenile survival, suggesting that wood frogs may be able to overcome initial disadvantages to have similar post-metamorphic performance. our study suggests that variation in the age of maturity for wood frogs may mitigate risks associated with breeding in a highly variable habitat to maximize lifetime fitness without increasing lifespan, and this strategy is minimally affected by carry-over effects from the larval stage."
demography of plains zebras (equus quagga) under heavy predation,cmr; equids; population limitation; predation; tropical ecosystems,POPULATION ECOLOGY,GRANGE S;BARNIER F;DUNCAN P;GAILLARD JM;VALEIX M;NCUBE H;PERIQUET S;FRITZ H,"in natural ecosystems, ungulate densities show strong temporal variations. the ecological processes driving these fluctuations are complex: food limitation and predation are both important and can interact. survival rates are central to this debate, but data are sparse for tropical ecosystems. here, we estimate age- and sex-specific survival rates for plains zebra in hwange national park, a nutrient-poor savanna with a high predator-prey ratio. we estimated survival from a detailed capture-mark-recapture (cmr) monitoring based on 248 individual life histories, for the first time in an african grazer. we controlled for variations in detection probabilities among adult females, which resulted from their social structure. as expected, annual survival was low during the first year (0.441); increased in yearlings (0.560) and peaked at 0.795 and 0.847 in adult males and females respectively. the survival of adult females was lower during the dry season, which probably resulted from higher predation due to predictable movements of zebras to waterholes. survival at all ages was low compared to ungulates without predators. the demographic model we constructed showed a declining trend (lambda = 0.94), which was consistent with the data from road counts ( = 0.92). life table response experiment (ltre) analyses using the serengeti and kruger populations as references showed that the main cause of this declining trend in the hwange population was low survival in yearling and adult females; low foal survival also contributed. in this ecosystem, predation is likely to be the main ecological process causing low survival, and therefore a decline in the zebra population."
removal and mark-recapture methods for estimating abundance: empirical and simulation results for mottled sculpin in streams,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,RUETZ CR;HARRIS BS;MCNAIR JN;HOMOLA JJ,"most studies that investigate biases in stream fish abundance estimators focus on salmonines, yet nongame species comprise a major portion of fish assemblages. we evaluated mark-recapture (the lincoln-petersen estimator with chapman correction) and removal (constant capture probability and generalized removal estimators) methods for estimating abundance of mottled sculpin cottus bairdii, and we tested whether assumptions of the abundance estimators (i.e., the population is closed during sampling; and marks are detected) were reasonable. over 2-d periods, fish in eight streams were sampled by using backpack electrofishing in 90-m reaches (each divided into three 30-m subreaches) to assess movement. removal abundance estimates were significantly lower than mark-recapture estimates. moreover, removal estimates were 52% lower than the known number of marked individuals, likely because capture probability (q) was low and declined with subsequent sampling passes. survival of fish held in cages was 100%; there were no undetected marks among fish held overnight. for all streams combined, 11% of recaptured fish that were marked in the core subreach were recaptured on day 2 in an adjoining subreach. in five of the eight study streams, movement of marked fish from the core subreach was not detected, suggesting that in most streams the population was closed to movement. using computer simulations, we found that low numbers of recaptures (mean < 6) negatively biased the mark-recapture estimator; however, the estimator was positively biased when the study population was open to movement-meaning that marked and unmarked fish were lost from the study reach as new, unmarked fish entered. our results indicate that the removal estimator was negatively biased. we recommend using the mark-recapture method to estimate abundance when q is low (e.g., 0.21 in our study), with the caveat that study reach length must be sufficient to minimize fish movement across reach boundaries when block nets cannot be maintained between sampling events."
comparison of tributary survival estimates of steelhead using cormack-jolly-seber and barker models: implications for sampling efforts and designs,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,CONNER MM;BENNETT SN;SAUNDERS WC;BOUWES N,"we conducted simulations to compare the precision and bias of survival estimates from cormack-jolly-seber (cjs) and barker models to known parameter values based on empirical data for steelhead/resident rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss from the john day river, oregon. we simulated seasonal differences in recapture and survival rates, and we varied the number of fish tagged, recapture and resight rates, sample site size, and fish movement (migratory or resident). survival estimates from the barker model had higher precision and lower or equal bias in comparison with estimates from the cjs model under almost all simulation scenarios. the precision of barker survival estimates increased the most as the number of tagged fish increased from 50 to 200 (cv d 0.4-0.09). the barker model's superior performance was dependent on the availability of resight data; such data are becoming more readily available, especially in places where large numbers of individuals are pit-tagged and where an interrogation infrastructure exists (e.g., columbia river basin). tagging of 75-100 fish/site during high-capture periods (e.g., summer and fall) and focusing on the resighting of fish with fixed or mobile interrogators during low-capture periods (i.e., winter and spring) may be the most cost-effective strategy for improving estimates of juvenile steelhead survival."
early emigration of juvenile coho salmon: implications for population monitoring,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,REBENACK JJ;RICKER S;ANDERSON C;WALLACE M;WARD DM,"salmon monitoring programs often measure juvenile production by operating migrant traps downstream of spawning and rearing areas during smolt migration. however, this approach does not account for individuals that move downstream of trapping locations prior to smolt sampling. we used a mark-recapture study with passive integrated transponder tagging to estimate the proportion of coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch juveniles, tagged in the fall in a northern california stream, that migrated to rearing habitat downstream of a seasonally operated trap before spring smolt sampling. emigrants were detected by using the migrant trap, located near the upstream limit of tidal influence, and continuously operated antennas located in tidal wetlands downstream of the trap. for all three cohorts sampled (2010, 2011, 2012), we identified two distinct emigration periods (not including fry emigrants that emigrated in spring at a size too small to tag): a fall-winter period, when early emigrant parr moved into a restored tidal wetland (early emigrants); and a spring period, when smolts emigrated (smolt emigrants). there was little movement in the intervening period. emigration timing varied depending on the location in the basin where fish were tagged; locations in the lower main stem generally produced more early emigrants, while locations in the upper basin produced more smolt emigrants. across locations, early emigrants accounted for 2-25% of the fall-marked juveniles from 2010, 8-29% from 2011, and 7-13% in 2012. smolt emigrants accounted for 15-49% of the fall-marked juveniles from 2010, 13-14% from 2011, and 3-35% from 2012. the consistent occurrence of early emigration in this and other recent studies brings into question estimates of smolt abundance and demographic rates (e.g., overwinter and marine survival) that do not account for this life history variant."

genetic fingerprinting proves cross-correlated automatic photo-identification of individuals as highly efficient in large capture-mark-recapture studies,genecap; noninvasive individual recognition; shape patterns; single-use application; standardized cross-correlation; wild-id,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,DRECHSLER A;HELLING T;STEINFARTZ S,"capture-mark-recapture (cmr) approaches are the backbone of many studies in population ecology to gain insight on the life cycle, migration, habitat use, and demography of target species. the reliable and repeatable recognition of an individual throughout its lifetime is the basic requirement of a cmr study. although invasive techniques are available to mark individuals permanently, noninvasive methods for individual recognition mainly rest on photographic identification of external body markings, which are unique at the individual level. the re-identification of an individual based on comparing shape patterns of photographs by eye is commonly used. automated processes for photographic re-identification have been recently established, but their performance in large datasets (i.e., > 1000 individuals) has rarely been tested thoroughly. here, we evaluated the performance of the program amphident, an automatic algorithm to identify individuals on the basis of ventral spot patterns in the great crested newt (triturus cristatus) versus the genotypic fingerprint of individuals based on highly polymorphic microsatellite loci using genecap. between 2008 and 2010, we captured, sampled and photographed adult newts and calculated for 1648 samples/photographs recapture rates for both approaches. recapture rates differed slightly with 8.34% for genecap and 9.83% for amphident. with an estimated rate of 2% false rejections (frr) and 0.00% false acceptances (far), amphident proved to be a highly reliable algorithm for cmr studies of large datasets. we conclude that the application of automatic recognition software of individual photographs can be a rather powerful and reliable tool in noninvasive cmr studies for a large number of individuals. because the cross-correlation of standardized shape patterns is generally applicable to any pattern that provides enough information, this algorithm is capable of becoming a single application with broad use in cmr studies for many species."

estimating sex-specific abundance in fawning areas of a high-density columbian black-tailed deer population using fecal dna,abundance; black-tailed deer; mark-recapture; microsatellite; noninvasive dna; sex ratio,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,LOUNSBERRY ZT;FORRESTER TD;OLEGARIO MT;BRAZEAL JL;WITTMER HU;SACKS BN,"the recent development of fecal-genetic capture-mark-recapture (cmr) methods has increased the feasibility of estimating abundance of forest-dwelling ungulates that are difficult to survey using visual methods. unless genetic markers differentiating sex are incorporated into such studies, however, genetic cmr approaches risk missing sex-specific differences in population trends. we developed a single-reaction genetic assay for sex and individual identification, including 10 microsatellites and an sry marker, and applied it in the context of a post-fawning cmr study of columbian black-tailed deer (odocoileus hemionus columbianus) in forested habitat of coastal california during 2011 and 2012. we measured sex-specific abundance and sex ratios in high-quality summer habitats encompassing 4 distinct fawning areas. we detected a significant interaction between sex and year, indicating different trends in the abundance of males and females. we also detected a significant decline in abundance of females between years (p=0.045), which agreed with independent telemetry-based estimates, and significant differences in female abundance among fawning areas (p=0.020) but no significant differences in the abundance of males for either variable (f-1-3,f-20 < 0.710, p>0.410). when sex was not considered in the analysis, we found no significant differences in abundance between the 2 years, suggesting that differing trends between the 2 sexes obscured the female-specific patterns. we estimated average local (i.e., on the high-quality summer ranges) density ((d) over cap) for females at 41.0 (+/- 5.9)deer/km(2) in 2011 and 29.1 (+/- 6.8)deer/km(2) in 2012, and local density of males at 15.7 (+/- 3.0)deer/km(2) across the 2 study years. accordingly, sex ratios differed between years (95% ci=3.0-4.2 f:m ratio in 2011, 2.0-2.3 f:m ratio in 2012). incorporating sex and individual markers into a single assay provided a cost-effective means of applying cmr estimation based on fecal dna to a high-density ungulate population in a forested ecosystem and emphasized the importance of explicitly modeling sex in abundance estimation.

using multistate capture-mark-recapture models to quantify effects of predation on age-specific survival and population growth in black-tailed deer,deer; population dynamics; predator-prey interactions; puma; ungulates; vital rates,POPULATION ECOLOGY,MARESCOT L;FORRESTER TD;CASADY DS;WITTMER HU,"effective species management and conservation relies on accurate estimates of vital rates and an understanding of their link to environmental variables. we used multistate capture-mark-recapture models to directly quantify effects of predation on age-specific survival of black-tailed deer odocoileus hemionus columbianus in california, usa. survival probabilities were derived from individual encounter histories of 136 fawns and 57 adults monitored over 4 years. based on results from our survival analysis we parameterized a lefkovitch matrix and used elasticity analyses to investigate contributions of mortality due to predation to changes in population growth. we found strong evidence for age-specific survival including senescence. survival of females > 1 year old was consistently low (0.56 +/- a 0.18 for yearlings, 0.77 +/- a 0.13 for prime-aged females, and 0.55 +/- a 0.08 for senescent individuals), primarily due to high puma puma concolor predation during summer. predation from black bears ursus americanus and coyotes canis latrans was the primary cause for low annual survival of fawns (0.24 +/- a 0.16). resulting estimates of population growth rates were indicative of a strongly declining population (lambda = 0.82 +/- a 0.13). despite high sensitivity to changes in adult survival, results from a lower-level elasticity analysis suggested that predation on fawns was the most significant individual mortality component affecting population decline. our results provide a rare, direct link between predation, age-specific survival and the predicted population decline of a common ungulate species. the magnitude of predation was unexpected and suggests that ungulates in multi-predator systems struggle to cope with simultaneous reductions in survival probabilities from predators targeting different age classes."
brown trout removal effects on short-term survival and movement of myxobolus cerebralis-resistant rainbow trout,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,FETHERMAN ER;WINKELMAN DL;BAILEY LL;SCHISLER GJ;DAVIES K,"following establishment of myxobolus cerebralis (the parasite responsible for salmonid whirling disease) in colorado, populations of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss experienced significant declines, whereas brown trout salmo trutta densities increased in many locations across the state, potentially influencing the success of m. cerebralis-resistant rainbow trout reintroductions. we examined the effects of brown trout removal on the short-term (3-month) survival and movement of two crosses of reintroduced, m. cerebralis-resistant rainbow trout in the cache la poudre river, colorado. radio frequency identification passive integrated transponder tags and antennas were used to track movements of wild brown trout and stocked rainbow trout in reaches where brown trout had or had not been removed. multistate mark-recapture models were used to estimate tagged fish apparent survival and movement in these sections 3 months following brown trout removal. a cross between the german rainbow trout and colorado river rainbow trout strains exhibited similar survival and movement probabilities in the reaches, suggesting that the presence of brown trout did not affect its survival or movement. however, a cross between the german rainbow trout and harrison lake rainbow trout exhibited less movement from the reach in which brown trout had been removed. despite this, the overall short-term benefits of the removal were equivocal, suggesting that brown trout removal may not be beneficial for the reintroduction of rainbow trout. additionally, the logistical constraints of conducting removals in large river systems are substantial and may not be a viable management option in many rivers."
movement behaviour of the carabid beetle pterostichus melanarius in crops and at a habitat interface explains patterns of population redistribution in the field,NA,PLOS ONE,ALLEMA B;VAN DER WERF W;VAN LENTEREN JC;HEMERIK L;ROSSING WAH,"animals may respond to habitat quality and habitat edges and these responses may affect their distribution between habitats. we studied the movement behaviour of a ground-dwelling generalist predator, the carabid beetle pterostichus melanarius (illiger). we performed a mark-recapture experiment in two adjacent habitats; a large plot with oilseed radish (raphanus sativus) and a plot with rye (secale cereale). we used model selection to identify a minimal model representing the mark-recapture data, and determine whether habitat-specific motility and boundary behaviour affected population redistribution. we determined movement characteristics of p. melanarius in laboratory arenas with the same plant species using video recording. both the field and arena results showed preference behaviour of p. melanarius at the habitat interface. in the field, significantly more beetles moved from rye to oilseed radish than from radish to rye. in the arena, habitat entry was more frequent into oilseed radish than into rye. in the field, movement was best described by a fokker-planck diffusion model that contained preference behaviour at the interface and did not account for habitat specific motility. likewise, motility calculated from movement data using the patlak model was not different between habitats in the arena studies. motility (m(2) d(-1)) calculated from behavioural data resulted in estimates that were similar to those determined in the field. thus individual behaviour explained population redistribution in the field qualitatively as well as quantitatively. the findings provide a basis for evaluating movement within and across habitats in complex agricultural landscapes with multiple habitats and habitat interfaces."
acoustic telemetry reveals large-scale migration patterns of walleye in lake huron,NA,PLOS ONE,HAYDEN TA;HOLBROOK CM;FIELDER DG;VANDERGOOT CS;BERGSTEDT RA;DETTMERS JM;KRUEGER CC;COOKE SJ,"fish migration in large freshwater lacustrine systems such as the laurentian great lakes is not well understood. the walleye (sander vitreus) is an economically and ecologically important native fish species throughout the great lakes. in lake huron walleye has recently undergone a population expansion as a result of recovery of the primary stock, stemming from changing food web dynamics. during 2011 and 2012, we used acoustic telemetry to document the timing and spatial scale of walleye migration in lake huron and saginaw bay. spawning walleye (n=199) collected from a tributary of saginaw bay were implanted with acoustic tags and their migrations were documented using acoustic receivers (n=140) deployed throughout u.s. nearshore waters of lake huron. three migration pathways were described using multistate mark-recapture models. models were evaluated using the akaike information criterion. fish sex did not influence migratory behavior but did affect migration rate and walleye were detected on all acoustic receiver lines. most (95%) tagged fish migrated downstream from the riverine tagging and release location to saginaw bay, and 37% of these fish emigrated from saginaw bay into lake huron. remarkably, 8% of walleye that emigrated from saginaw bay were detected at the acoustic receiver line located farthest from the release location more than 350 km away. most (64%) walleye returned to the saginaw river in 2012, presumably for spawning. our findings reveal that fish from this stock use virtually the entirety of u.s. nearshore waters of lake huron."

challenges in the use of genetic mark-recapture to estimate the population size of bwindi mountain gorillas (gorilla beringei beringei),detection probability; genetic census; genotyping noninvasive samples,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ROY J;VIGILANT L;GRAY M;WRIGHT E;KATO R;KABANO P;BASABOSE A;TIBENDA E;KUHL HS;ROBBINS MM,"monitoring the population dynamics of endangered species is a critical component of conservation management strategies, but attaining accurate and precise estimates of population sizes using cost and time effective methods can be challenging. routine censuses of the two populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas (gorilla beringei beringei have been conducted over the last decades to monitor populations and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation strategies. a census in 2006 of the mountain gorillas in bwindi impenetrable national park, uganda, showed the value of genetic analysis of fecal samples collected at nest sites by revealing discrepancies between the numbers of nests and uniquely identified gorillas. in this study, we censused the bwindi gorilla population using a 'mark-recapture' method which involved genetic analysis of fecal samples collected in 2011 during two 'sweep' surveys of the entire park. we found that a notable proportion of gorillas were missed in either of the two sweeps (minimum 35% and 31%, respectively). based on the number of genotyped gorillas and correction factors, we estimated the population to contain a minimum of 400 individuals. using the mark-recapture approach, we infer possibly as many as 430 gorillas (95% confidence interval: 398-487). as the 2010 census of the virunga massif population found 480 gorillas, the total number of mountain gorillas worldwide is at least 880 individuals. simulations using different mark-recapture models suggest that a future census of bwindi mountain gorillas would benefit by increasing the number of sweeps in order to achieve accurate and precise results. finally, based on our results, we recommend a sequential approach incorporating a pilot study and simulations for optimizing time and resources in large mammal genetic census studies.

improving abundance estimation by combining capture-recapture and occupancy data: example with a large carnivore,abundance; bayesian approach; camera-trapping; lynx lynx; population size; presence signs; site-occupancy,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,BLANC L;MARBOUTIN E;GATTI S;ZIMMERMANN F;GIMENEZ O,"1. abundance is a key quantity for conservation and management strategies but remains challenging to assess in the field. capture-recapture (cr) methods are often used to estimate abundance while correcting for imperfect detection, but these methods are costly. occupancy, sometimes considered as a surrogate for abundance, is estimated through the collection of presence/absence data and is less costly while allowing gathering of information at a large spatial scale. 2. building on the recent pieces of work on the combination of different data sources, we showed how abundance data can be complemented by presence/absence data and can be analysed conjointly to improve abundance estimates. our approach relies on a hierarchical model that makes explicit the link between the abundance and occupancy state variables while formally accounting for imperfect detection. 3. we used a population of eurasian lynx in france monitored via camera traps and a collection of presence signs as an illustration of our approach. 4. synthesis and applications. we combined capture-recapture and occupancy data and demonstrated that we can efficiently improve abundance estimates. our method can be used by managers when estimates of trends in abundance lack power due to sparse data collected during an intensive survey, by simply integrating data collected during non-systematic survey. furthermore, combining these two sampling procedures makes full use of all available data and allows the development of conservation and management strategies based on precise abundance estimates. overall, the combination of different data sources in an integrated statistical framework has great potential, especially for elusive species. we combined capture-recapture and occupancy data and demonstrated that we can efficiently improve abundance estimates. our method can be used by managers when estimates of trends in abundance lack power due to sparse data collected during an intensive survey, by simply integrating data collected during non-systematic survey. furthermore, combining these two sampling procedures makes full use of all available data and allows the development of conservation and management strategies based on precise abundance estimates. overall, the combination of different data sources in an integrated statistical framework has great potential, especially for elusive species."
"satellite tagging and biopsy sampling of killer whales at subantarctic marion island: effectiveness, immediate reactions and long-term responses",NA,PLOS ONE,REISINGER RR;OOSTHUIZEN WC;PERON G;TOUSSAINT DC;ANDREWS RD;DE BRUYN PJN,"remote tissue biopsy sampling and satellite tagging are becoming widely used in large marine vertebrate studies because they allow the collection of a diverse suite of otherwise difficult-to-obtain data which are critical in understanding the ecology of these species and to their conservation and management. researchers must carefully consider their methods not only from an animal welfare perspective, but also to ensure the scientific rigour and validity of their results. we report methods for shore-based, remote biopsy sampling and satellite tagging of killer whales orcinus orca at subantarctic marion island. the performance of these methods is critically assessed using 1) the attachment duration of low-impact minimally percutaneous satellite tags; 2) the immediate behavioural reactions of animals to biopsy sampling and satellite tagging; 3) the effect of researcher experience on biopsy sampling and satellite tagging; and 4) the mid- (1 month) and long- (24 month) term behavioural consequences. to study mid- and long-term behavioural changes we used multievent capture-recapture models that accommodate imperfect detection and individual heterogeneity. we made 72 biopsy sampling attempts (resulting in 32 tissue samples) and 37 satellite tagging attempts (deploying 19 tags). biopsy sampling success rates were low (43%), but tagging rates were high with improved tag designs (86%). the improved tags remained attached for 26 +/- 14 days (mean +/- sd). individuals most often showed no reaction when attempts missed (66%) and a slight reaction-defined as a slight flinch, slight shake, short acceleration, or immediate dive-when hit (54%). severe immediate reactions were never observed. hit or miss and age-sex class were important predictors of the reaction, but the method (tag or biopsy) was unimportant. multievent trap-dependence modelling revealed considerable variation in individual sighting patterns; however, there were no significant mid-or long-term changes following biopsy sampling or tagging."
year-round effects of climate on demographic parameters of an arctic-nesting goose species,capture-mark-recapture; chen caerulescens atlantica; climate change; harvest; multistate model,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,VAN OUDENHOVE L;GAUTHIER G;LEBRETON JD,"understanding how climate change will affect animal population dynamics remains a major challenge, especially in long-distant migrants exposed to different climatic regimes throughout their annual cycle. we evaluated the effect of temperature throughout the annual cycle on demographic parameters (age-specific survival and recruitment, breeding propensity and fecundity) of the greater snow goose (chen caerulescens atlantica l.), an arctic-nesting species. as this is a hunted species, we used the theory of exploited populations to estimate hunting mortality separately from natural mortality in order to evaluate climatic effects only on the latter form of mortality. our analysis was based on a 22-year marking study (n=27150 females) and included live recaptures at the breeding colony and dead recoveries from hunters. we tested the effect of climatic covariates by applying a procedure that accounts for unexplained environmental variation in the demographic parameter to a multistate capture-mark-recapture recruitment model. breeding propensity, clutch size and hatching probability all increased with high temperatures on the breeding grounds. first-year survival to natural causes of mortality increased when temperature was high at the end of the summer, whereas adult survival was not affected by temperature. on the contrary, accession to reproduction decreased with warmer climatic conditions during the non-breeding season. survival was strongly negatively related to hunting mortality in adults, as expected, but not in first-year birds, which suggests the possibility of compensation between natural and hunting mortality in the latter group. we show that events occurring both at and away from the breeding ground can affect the demography of migratory birds, either directly or through carryover effects, and sometimes in opposite ways. this highlights the need to account for the whole life cycle of an animal when attempting to project the response of populations to future climatic changes."
density-dependent intraspecific aggression regulates survival in northern yellowstone wolves (canis lupus),capture-recapture; density dependence; food availability; intraspecific competition; population regulation; top-predator; vital rate,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,CUBAYNES S;MACNULTY DR;STAHLER DR;QUIMBY KA;SMITH DW;COULSON T,"understanding the population dynamics of top-predators is essential to assess their impact on ecosystems and to guide their management. key to this understanding is identifying the mechanisms regulating vital rates. determining the influence of density on survival is necessary to understand the extent to which human-caused mortality is compensatory or additive. in wolves (canis lupus), empirical evidence for density-dependent survival is lacking. dispersal is considered the principal way in which wolves adjust their numbers to prey supply or compensate for human exploitation. however, studies to date have primarily focused on exploited wolf populations, in which density-dependent mechanisms are likely weak due to artificially low wolf densities. using 13years of data on 280 collared wolves in yellowstone national park, we assessed the effect of wolf density, prey abundance and population structure, as well as winter severity, on age-specific survival in two areas (prey-rich vs. prey-poor) of the national park. we further analysed cause-specific mortality and explored the factors driving intraspecific aggression in the prey-rich northern area of the park. overall, survival rates decreased during the study. in northern yellowstone, density dependence regulated adult survival through an increase in intraspecific aggression, independent of prey availability. in the interior of the park, adult survival was less variable and density-independent, despite reduced prey availability. there was no effect of prey population structure in northern yellowstone, or of winter severity in either area. survival was similar among yearlings and adults, but lower for adults older than 6years. our results indicate that density-dependent intraspecific aggression is a major driver of adult wolf survival in northern yellowstone, suggesting intrinsic density-dependent mechanisms have the potential to regulate wolf populations at high ungulate densities. when low prey availability or high removal rates maintain wolves at lower densities, limited inter-pack interactions may prevent density-dependent survival, consistent with our findings in the interior of the park."

estimation of summer flounder (paralichthys dentatus) mortality rates using mark-recapture data from a recreational angler-tagging program,mortality; angler-tagging; mark-recapture; barker model; summer flounder,FISHERIES RESEARCH,HENDERSON MJ;FABRIZIO MC,"volunteer angler-tagging programs have the potential to become a valuable tool for estimating fish mortality rates. we applied a reduced version of the barker mark-recapture model to estimate summer flounder mortality rates using data collected by an angler-tagging program in virginia. over a period of 12 years, recreational anglers released 47513 summer flounder in the chesapeake bay and its tributaries, of which 3240 were subsequently encountered. to account for heterogeneity in survival rates arising from size-based variation in fishing pressure, we categorized individual fish into size classes and used a growth model to predict recruitment of fish into each size class. due to concerns regarding tag loss, a double-tagging study was conducted and revealed that summer flounder tag retention rates were low for both sublegal and legal sized fish (0.5 +/- 0.08 per year). the tag-loss corrected mortality probability estimates for the 30-day period following release were approximately 0.6 for sublegal fish (<36 cm) and 0.65 for larger fish. once we compensated for this short-term mortality, we found that sublegal summer flounder experience much greater apparent annual mortality rates than larger fish. this may reflect actual differences in mortality as well as the increased likelihood of smaller fish to permanently emigrate to locations with reduced encounter probabilities. due to these size-dependent mortality rates we were unable to estimate a natural mortality rate. we conclude that angler-tagging programs can provide some insights into fish mortality rates but, in order to do so, they must be carefully designed and account for the multiple violations of mark-recapture model assumptions.

high female mortality resulting in herd collapse in free-ranging domesticated reindeer (rangifer tarandus tarandus) in sweden,NA,PLOS ONE,AHMAN B;SVENSSON K;RONNEGARD L,"reindeer herding in sweden is a form of pastoralism practised by the indigenous sami population. the economy is mainly based on meat production. herd size is generally regulated by harvest in order not to overuse grazing ranges and keep a productive herd. nonetheless, herd growth and room for harvest is currently small in many areas. negative herd growth and low harvest rate were observed in one of two herds in a reindeer herding community in central sweden. the herds (a and b) used the same ranges from april until the autumn gathering in october-december, but were separated on different ranges over winter. analyses of capture-recapture for 723 adult female reindeer over five years (2007-2012) revealed high annual losses (7.1% and 18.4%, for herd a and b respectively). a continuing decline in the total reindeer number in herd b demonstrated an inability to maintain the herd size in spite of a very small harvest. an estimated breakpoint for when herd size cannot be kept stable confirmed that the observed female mortality rate in herd b represented a state of herd collapse. lower calving success in herd b compared to a indicated differences in winter foraging conditions. however, we found only minor differences in animal body condition between the herds in autumn. we found no evidence that a lower autumn body mass generally increased the risk for a female of dying from one autumn to the next. we conclude that the prime driver of the on-going collapse of herd b is not high animal density or poor body condition. accidents or disease seem unlikely as major causes of mortality. predation, primarily by lynx and wolverine, appears to be the most plausible reason for the high female mortality and state of collapse in the studied reindeer herding community."
"teeth, sex, and testosterone: aging in the world's smallest primate",NA,PLOS ONE,ZOHDY S;GERBER BD;TECOT S;BLANCO MB;WINCHESTER JM;WRIGHT PC;JERNVALL J,"mouse lemurs (microcebus spp.) are an exciting new primate model for understanding human aging and disease. in captivity, microcebus murinus develops human-like ailments of old age after five years (e.g., neurodegeneration analogous to alzheimer's disease) but can live beyond 12 years. it is believed that wild microcebus follow a similar pattern of senescence observed in captive animals, but that predation limits their lifespan to four years, thus preventing observance of these diseases in the wild. testing whether this assumption is true is informative about both microcebus natural history and environmental influences on senescence, leading to interpretation of findings for models of human aging. additionally, the study of microcebus longevity provides an opportunity to better understand mechanisms of sex-biased longevity. longevity is often shorter in males of species with high male-male competition, such as microcebus, but mouse lemurs are sexually monomorphic, suggesting similar lifespans. we collected individual-based observations of wild brown mouse lemurs (microcebus rufus) from 2003-2010 to investigate sex-differences in survival and longevity. fecal testosterone was measured as a potential mechanism of sex-based differences in survival. we used a combination of high-resolution tooth wear techniques, mark-recapture, and hormone enzyme immunoassays. we found no dental or physical signs of senescence in m. rufus as old as eight years (n = 189, ages 1-8, mean = 2.59 +/- 1.63 se), three years older than captive, senescent congeners (m. murinus). unlike other polygynandrous vertebrates, we found no sex difference in age-dependent survival, nor sex or age differences in testosterone levels. while elevated male testosterone levels have been implicated in shorter lifespans in several species, this is one of the first studies to show equivalent testosterone levels accompanying equivalent lifespans. future research on captive aged individuals can determine if senescence is partially a condition of their captive environment, and studies controlling for various environmental factors will further our understanding of senescence."
trap array configuration influences estimates and precision of black bear density and abundance,NA,PLOS ONE,WILTON CM;PUCKETT EE;BERINGER J;GARDNER B;EGGERT LS;BELANT JL,"spatial capture-recapture (scr) models have advanced our ability to estimate population density for wide ranging animals by explicitly incorporating individual movement. though these models are more robust to various spatial sampling designs, few studies have empirically tested different large-scale trap configurations using scr models. we investigated how extent of trap coverage and trap spacing affects precision and accuracy of scr parameters, implementing models using the r package secr. we tested two trapping scenarios, one spatially extensive and one intensive, using black bear (ursus americanus) dna data from hair snare arrays in south-central missouri, usa. we also examined the influence that adding a second, lower barbed-wire strand to snares had on quantity and spatial distribution of detections. we simulated trapping data to test bias in density estimates of each configuration under a range of density and detection parameter values. field data showed that using multiple arrays with intensive snare coverage produced more detections of more individuals than extensive coverage. consequently, density and detection parameters were more precise for the intensive design. density was estimated as 1.7 bears per 100 km(2) and was 5.5 times greater than that under extensive sampling. abundance was 279 (95% ci = 193-406) bears in the 16,812 km(2) study area. excluding detections from the lower strand resulted in the loss of 35 detections, 14 unique bears, and the largest recorded movement between snares. all simulations showed low bias for density under both configurations. results demonstrated that in low density populations with non-uniform distribution of population density, optimizing the tradeoff among snare spacing, coverage, and sample size is of critical importance to estimating parameters with high precision and accuracy. with limited resources, allocating available traps to multiple arrays with intensive trap spacing increased the amount of information needed to inform parameters with high precision."
can establishment success be determined through demographic parameters? a case study on five introduced bird species,NA,PLOS ONE,SANZ AGUILAR A;ANADON JD;EDELAAR P;CARRETE M;TELLA JL,"the dominant criterion to determine when an introduced species is established relies on the maintenance of a self-sustaining population in the area of introduction, i.e. on the viability of the population from a demographic perspective. there is however a paucity of demographic studies on introduced species, and establishment success is thus generally determined by expert opinion without undertaking population viability analyses (pvas). by means of an intensive five year capture-recapture monitoring program (involving >12,000 marked individuals) we studied the demography of five introduced passerine bird species in southern spain which are established and have undergone a fast expansion over the last decades. we obtained useful estimates of demographic parameters (survival and reproduction) for one colonial species (ploceus melanocephalus), confirming the long-term viability of its local population through pvas. however, extremely low recapture rates prevented the estimation of survival parameters and population growth rates for widely distributed species with low local densities (estrilda troglodytes and amandava amandava) but also for highly abundant yet non-colonial species (estrilda astrild and euplectes afer). therefore, determining the establishment success of introduced passerine species by demographic criteria alone may often be troublesome even when devoting much effort to field-work. alternative quantitative methodologies such as the analysis of spatio-temporal species distributions complemented with expert opinion deserve thus their role in the assessment of establishment success of introduced species when estimates of demographic parameters are difficult to obtain, as is generally the case for non-colonial, highly mobile passerines."

in situ tagging technique for fishes provides insight into growth and movement of invasive lionfish,animal health; animal movement; fish behavior; invasive species; mark-recapture; pterois volitans; red lionfish; site fidelity; tagging method,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,AKINS JL;MORRIS JA;GREEN SJ,"information on fish movement and growth is primarily obtained through the marking and tracking of individuals with external tags, which are usually affixed to anesthetized individuals at the surface. however, the quantity and quality of data obtained by this method is often limited by small sample sizes owing to the time associated with the tagging process, high rates of tagging-related mortality, and displacement of tagged individuals from the initial capture location. to address these issues, we describe a technique for applying external streamer and dart tags in situ, which uses scuba divers to capture and tag individual fish on the sea floor without the use of anesthetic. we demonstrate this method for indo-pacific lionfish (pterois volitans/p. miles), species which are particularly vulnerable to barotrauma when transported to and handled at the surface. to test our method, we tagged 161 individuals inhabiting 26 coral reef locations in the bahamas over a period of 3 years. our method resulted in no instances of barotrauma, reduced handling and recovery time, and minimal post-tagging release displacement compared with conventional ex situ tag application. opportunistic resighting and recapture of tagged individuals reveals that lionfish exhibit highly variable site fidelity, movement patterns, and growth rates on invaded coral reef habitats. in total, 24% of lionfish were resighted between 29 and 188 days after tagging. of these, 90% were located at the site of capture, while the remaining individuals were resighted between 200 m and 1.1 km from initial site of capture over 29 days later. in situ growth rates ranged between 0.1 and 0.6 mm/day. while individuals tagged with streamer tags posted slower growth rates with increasing size, as expected, there was no relationship between growth rate and fish size for individuals marked with dart tags, potentially because of large effects of tag presence on the activities of small bodied lionfish (i.e., < 150 mm), where the tag was up to 7.6% of the lionfish's mass. our study offers a novel in situ tagging technique that can be used to provide critical information on fish site fidelity, movement patterns, and growth in cases where ex situ tagging is not feasible."
demographic variation in the uk serotine bat: filling gaps in knowledge for management,eptesicus serotinus; favourable conservation status; prereproductive delay; reproduction; survival; temporal variation,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CHAUVENET ALM;HUTSON AM;SMITH GC;AEGERTER JN,"species of conservation concern, or those in conflict with man, are most efficiently managed with an understanding of their population dynamics. european bats exemplify the need for successful and cost-effective management for both reasons, often simultaneously. across europe, bats are protected, and the concept of favourable conservation status (fcs) is used as a key tool for the assessment and licensing of disruptive actions to populations. however, for efficient decision-making, this assessment requires knowledge on the demographic rates and long-term dynamics of populations. we used capture-mark-recapture to describe demographic rates for the serotine bat (eptesicus serotinus) at two sites in england and investigate the transition rates between three stages: juveniles, immatures, and breeders. we then use these rates in an individual-based population dynamics model to investigate the expected trajectories for both populations. our results demonstrate for the first time the presence and scale of temporal variation in this species' demography. we describe the lengthy prereproductive period (3.5 years) that female serotines experience. finally, we show how site-specific variation in demographic rates can produce divergent population trajectories. effective management of european bat populations can be achieved through the understanding of life histories, and local demographic rates and population dynamics, in order to anticipate the presence of source and sink sites in the landscape. using the serotine bat in england, we show that these can be obtained from rigorous and systematic studies of long-term demographic datasets."
experimental evaluation shows limited influence of pine plantations on the connectivity of highly fragmented bird populations,australia; birds; dispersal; functional connectivity; matrix; pine and conifer plantations; population synchrony,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MORTELLITI A;WESTGATE MJ;LINDENMAYER DB,"1. conversion of natural and agricultural areas to conifer plantations is an important element of global change. despite their widespread distribution and global importance, it is still unclear whether conifer plantations hinder or enhance movement by biota. 2. population connectivity is difficult to quantify without detailed studies such as those using capture-mark-recapture methods. a novel solution is to quantify the synchrony in abundance between populations over time. using this approach, more connected populations are expected to display synchrony, whereas disconnected populations are expected to fluctuate asynchronously. here, we compared the relative effects of spatial proximity and matrix type on the population synchrony of a suite of forest-dependent birds in a long-term, fully controlled, and replicated landscape-scale experiment in south-eastern australia. 3. our experiment consisted of comparing bird populations inhabiting remnant eucalypt patches surrounded by radiata pine pinus radiata plantations (50 patches) with bird populations inhabiting remnant eucalypt patches where the surrounding landscapes are grazing fields (55 patches). our data set encompassed 10 years and included 52 bird species characterized by different life history traits. after controlling for the effects of rainfall and patch characteristics on population dynamics, we found that spatial proximity, not matrix type, was the main driver of population synchrony for 16 species. the effect of the pine plantation matrix was negative (it reduced synchrony). however, the magnitude of its effect was particularly low (being significant only in four species). 4. synthesis and applications. our results show that pine plantations do not increase connectivity. in fact, they have little effect, with the exception of a few species, for which they may constitute a barrier. the implications of our findings for landscape management are that the conversion of agricultural areas to plantation forestry does not promote substantial movement of individuals (to the extent that would synchronize populations). therefore, plantation expansion should not be promoted on the belief that it increases connectivity relative to an agricultural matrix."
habitat-specific effectiveness of feral cat control for the conservation of an endemic ground-nesting bird species,camera trapping; invasive species; meso-predator release effect; predator control; shorebird; spatially explicit mark-recapture; wader,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,OPPEL S;BURNS F;VICKERY J;GEORGE K;ELLICK G;LEO D;HILLMAN JC,"1. invasive non-native species are one of the greatest drivers of the loss of biodiversity world-wide. consequently, removing or controlling invasive predators should generally benefit vulnerable native species. however, especially on islands, where most mammalian predators are introduced, these predators may also prey on other invasive mammals. removing only apex predators may lead to increases of meso-predators that may in turn increase predation pressure on native wildlife. 2. we examined the benefits of a feral cat felis catus control programme on nest survival of a critically endangered ground-nesting bird, the st helena plover charadrius sanctaehelenae in two habitat types, harbouring c. 30% of the global population of this species. we monitored nest success and the activity of introduced mammals (cats, rabbits oryctolagus cuniculus, rats rattus rattus and rattus norvegicus, and mice mus musculus) over 2 years, before and after controlling feral cats. 3. live trapping removed 56 feral cats from our study areas. in the semi-desert, rabbit and mouse activity increased, but rat activity remained low after feral cat control. in pastures, rat and mouse activity increased after feral cat control, while rabbit activity remained constant. 4. nest survival of plovers increased more than threefold in the semi-desert, but increased only marginally in pastures. this difference may be due to an increase in rat activity and potentially rat predation following cat control in pastures, whereas no increase in rat activity was observed in the semi-desert. 5. synthesis and applications. our study shows habitat-specific consequences of feral cat control on ground-nesting bird productivity after 1 year, probably mediated by differences in the availability of alternative prey. the results highlight the importance of experimental trials and a thorough understanding of the interactions between multiple invasive species before predator-control operations are implemented over larger scales. on islands with multiple invasive species, there may not be a simple generic approach to predator management (other than removing all invasive species simultaneously)."

to breed or not: a novel approach to estimate breeding propensity and potential trade-offs in an arctic-nesting species,breeding propensity; chen caerulescens atlantica; cost of reproduction; greater snow goose; heterogeneity; multi-event models; reproduction; reproduction strategy; survival; temporary emigration,ECOLOGY,SOUCHAY G;GAUTHIER G;PRADEL R,"breeding propensity, i.e., the probability that a mature female attempts to breed in a given year, is a critical demographic parameter in long-lived species. life-history theory predicts that this trait should be affected by reproductive trade-offs so that the probability of future reproduction should depend on the current reproductive investment. however, breeding propensity is one of the most difficult parameters to estimate because nonbreeders are often absent from the breeding area, thereby requiring the inclusion of unobservable states in the analysis. we developed a new methodological approach by integrating a robust design sampling scheme within the multi-event capture-recapture framework. our new model accounted for uncertainty in state assignation while allowing for departure of individuals between secondary sampling occasions. we applied this model to a long-term data set of female greater snow geese (chen caerulescens atlantica) to estimate breeding propensity and to investigate potential reproductive costs. we combined resightings during the nesting stage and recapture at the end of the breeding season to estimate breeding propensity and nesting success, and added recoveries to improve survival probability estimates. we found that both breeding propensity and nesting success depended upon breeding status in the previous year, though not survival. successful breeders had a lower breeding propensity than failed breeders in the following year, but a higher nesting success. individuals absent from the breeding colony had a low breeding propensity, but a high nesting success the following year. our results suggest a cost of reproduction on breeding propensity in the next year, but once females decide to breed, nesting success is likely driven by individual quality. an added benefit of our model is that, unlike previous models with unobservable states, all parameters were identifiable when survival and breeding probabilities were fully state dependent. our new multi-event framework is a flexible tool that can be applied to a large range of species to estimate breeding propensity and to investigate reproductive trade-offs."
"estimates of annual survival, growth, and recruitment of a white-tailed ptarmigan population in colorado over 43 years",alpine; colorado; demography; lagopus leucura; weather,POPULATION ECOLOGY,WANN GT;ALDRIDGE CL;BRAUN CE,"long-term datasets for high-elevation species are rare, and considerable uncertainty exists in understanding how high-elevation populations have responded to recent climate warming. we present estimates of demographic vital rates from a 43-year population study of white-tailed ptarmigan (lagopus leucura), a species endemic to alpine habitats in western north america. we used capture-recapture models to estimate annual rates of apparent survival, population growth, and recruitment for breeding-age ptarmigan, and we fit winter weather covariates to models in an attempt to explain annual variation. there were no trends in survival over the study period but there was strong support for age and sex effects. the average rate of annual growth suggests a relatively stable breeding-age population ( = 1.036), but there was considerable variation between years for both population growth and recruitment rates. winter weather covariates only explained a small amount of variation in female survival and were not an important predictor of male survival. cumulative winter precipitation was found to have a quadratic effect on female survival, with survival being highest during years of average precipitation. cumulative winter precipitation was positively correlated with population growth and recruitment rates, although this covariate only explained a small amount of annual variation in these rates and there was considerable uncertainty among the models tested. our results provide evidence for an alpine-endemic population that has not experienced extirpation or drastic declines. however, more information is needed to understand risks and vulnerabilities of warming effects on juveniles as our analysis was confined to determination of vital rates for breeding-age birds."
"survival, demography, and growth of gopher tortoises (gopherus polyphemus) from three study sites with different management histories",demography; gopher tortoise; gopherus polyphemus; growth; habitat management; population recovery; survivorship,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,TUBERVILLE TD;TODD BD;HERMANN SM;MICHENER WK;GUYER C,"recovery or sustainable management of wildlife populations often entails management of habitat on which they depend. in this regard, turtles pose unique conservation challenges because of their life histories. the combination of late maturity, low survival when young, and dependence on high adult survival suggests they may be slow to respond demographically to conventional habitat management. thus, long-term studies are necessary to understand population dynamics and recovery potential in these species. we used 5-11 years of mark-recapture data from 3 populations to evaluate survivorship, demography, and somatic growth of gopher tortoises (gopherus polyphemus). green grove and wade tract (southwest ga) are ecological reserves with a history of land management compatible with tortoises. in contrast, conecuh national forest (south-central al) is a closed-canopy pine plantation with prior intensive site preparation but where management intervention improved habitat for tortoises during the study. apparent survival was high for mature tortoises (87-98%) compared to immature tortoises (70-82%). adults comprised 57-79% of individuals captured, with green grove and wade tract populations dominated by larger individuals but conecuh having a more uniform size distribution. the largest adults captured at conecuh (297mm maximum carapace length [cl]) were smaller than the largest adults from green grove (337mm cl) or wade tract (341mm cl), although characteristic growth constants from von bertalanffy models were similar among sites. we suggest these results indicate a recovering population at conecuh, where habitat conditions for gopher tortoises have improved despite a legacy of intense predation by humans and reduced habitat quality at the inception of this national forest. further, we recommend using a combination of short-term and long-term monitoring metrics to assess population recovery in such long-lived species.

environmental correlates of temporary emigration for female weddell seals and consequences for recruitment,"capture-mark-recapture; colonial breeding; density dependence; environmental variability; marine mammal; mcmurdo sound, antarctica; open robust-design multistate; pinniped; ross sea; trade-offs; unobservable states",ECOLOGY,STAUFFER GE;ROTELLA JJ;GARROTT RA;KENDALL WL,"in colonial-breeding species, prebreeders often emigrate temporarily from natal reproductive colonies then subsequently return for one or more years before producing young. variation in attendance-nonattendance patterns can have implications for subsequent recruitment. we used open robust-design multistate models and 28 years of encounter data for prebreeding female weddell seals (leptonychotes weddellii [lesson]) to evaluate hypotheses about (1) the relationships of temporary emigration (te) probabilities to environmental and population size covariates and (2) motivations for attendance and consequences of nonattendance for subsequent probability of recruitment to the breeding population. te probabilities were density dependent ((beta) over cap (bpop) = 0.66, (se) over cap = 0.17; estimated effects [beta] and standard errors of population size in the previous year) and increased when the fast-ice edge was distant from the breeding colonies ((beta) over cap (dist) = 0.75, (se) over cap = 0.04; estimated effects and standard errors of distance to the sea-ice edge in the current year on te probability in the current year) and were strongly age and state dependent. these results suggest that trade-offs between potential benefits and costs of colony attendance vary annually and might influence motivation to attend colonies. recruitment probabilities were greatest for seals that consistently attended colonies in two or more years (e.g., (psi) over cap (age10) = 0.56, sd = 0.17) and lowest for seals that never or inconsistently attended prior to recruitment (e.g., (psi) over cap (age10) = 0.32, sd = 0.15), where (psi) over cap (age10) denotes the mean recruitment probability (over all years) for 10-year-old seals for the specified prebreeder state. in colonial-breeding seabirds, repeated colony attendance increases subsequent probability of recruitment to the adult breeding population; our results suggest similar implications for a marine mammal and are consistent with the hypothesis that prebreeders were motivated to attend reproductive colonies to gain reproductive skills or perhaps to optimally synchronize estrus through close association with mature breeding females."
estimating nest abundance while accounting for time-to-event processes and imperfect detection,"anas discors; blue-winged teal; capture-recapture; habitat choice; nest success; north and south dakota, usa; population density; population dynamics; prairie pothole region",ECOLOGY,PERON G;WALKER J;ROTELLA J;HINES JE;NICHOLS JD,"birds and their population dynamics are often used to understand and document anthropogenic effects on biodiversity. nest success is a critical component of the breeding output of birds in different environments; but to obtain the complete picture of how bird populations respond to perturbations, we also need an estimate of nest abundance or density. the problem is that raw counts generally underestimate actual nest numbers because detection is imperfect and because some nests may fail or fledge before being subjected to detection efforts. here we develop a state-space superpopulation capture-recapture approach in which inference about detection probability is based on the age at first detection, as opposed to the sequence of re-detections in standard capture-recapture models. we apply the method to ducks in which (1) the age of the nests and their initiation dates can be determined upon detection and (2) the duration of the different stages of the breeding cycle is a priori known. we fit three model variants with or without assumptions about the phenology of nest initiation dates, and use simulations to evaluate the performance of the approach in challenging situations. in an application to blue-winged teal anas discors breeding at study sites in north and south dakota, usa, nesting stage (egg-laying or incubation) markedly influenced nest survival and detection probabilities. two individual covariates, one binary covariate (presence of grazing cattle at the nest site), and one continuous covariate (robel index of vegetation), had only weak effects. we estimated that 5-10% of the total number of nests were available for detection but were missed by field crews. an additional 6-15% were never available for detection. these percentages are expected to be larger in less intense, more typical sampling designs. user-friendly software nestabund is provided to assist users in implementing the method."
genetic and environmental influences on fitness-related traits in an endangered shorebird population,animal model; breeding time; heritability; mass; natal dispersal; piping plover,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,SAUNDERS SP;CUTHBERT FJ,"adaptation depends on the additive genetic variance for fitness and its component traits. yet estimating additive genetic variance and heritability for wild populations is challenging because determining relatedness of individuals is difficult. we used 20 years (1994-2013) of phenotypic records from mark-recapture data and a multi-generational pedigree to estimate quantitative genetic variation in three fitness-related traits in great lakes piping plovers (charadrius melodus), an endangered wild shorebird. genetic and environmental components of variance as well as heritabilities were estimated using bayesian inference for animal models. phenotypic variation in age-corrected chick mass was composed of a significant additive genetic component (h(2) = 0.27; 95% credible interval: 0.16-0.38), and hatch year, common maternal environment, and hatch site effects. conversely, natal dispersal distance and female breeding time were not significantly heritable (h(2) = 0.03; 95% ci: 0.0-0.11; h(2) = 0.08, 95% ci: 0.0-0.22, respectively). rather, environmental factors (e.g., breeding site) are the main sources of variation in these two traits. variation in female breeding time was minimally influenced by her mate and was moderately repeatable. the low potential for natal dispersal and breeding time to evolve may limit the ability of this population to adapt to climate change long-term. however, trait alteration could occur by a phenotypically plastic response, allowing rapid adjustment to novel environmental conditions and short-term persistence. depending on the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on the trait(s) of interest, results from quantitative genetic studies can also help identify management priorities for endangered populations.

food unpredictability in early life increases survival of captive grey partridges (perdix perdix) after release into the wild,multistate model; perdix perdix; post-release survival; prepare for release; reintroduction; unpredictable food supply,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,HOMBERGER B;JENNI L;DUPLAIN J;LANZ M;SCHAUB M,"reintroducing locally extinct species is an increasingly used conservation tool. however, many reintroductions fail to establish self-sustaining populations. the quality of the individuals released may crucially affect reintroduction success, but it is largely unknown which quality traits are important and how they might be improved, especially in captive-reared animals. we aimed at increasing survival of captive-bred grey partridges (perdix perdix) after release. we experimentally tested the effects of prenatal and postnatal unpredictable food supply on post-release survival of two captive strains (two or >30 generations in captivity). 691 full-grown birds representing all eight strain x prenatal x postnatal treatment combinations were released in autumn in 28 social groups (coveys) and followed in the field for six months by radio tracking and visual observations. data were analysed with multistate capture-recapture models including several random effects. post-release survival was higher in birds having encountered postnatal unpredictable food supply and decreased drastically with later release dates. also, coveys strongly affected an individual's survival prospects. our results suggest that post-release survival of captive-bred grey partridges can be increased significantly through simple, inexpensive pre-release measures in captivity, i.e. exposing them to an unpredictable environment. similar measures might be successful in other species and could ultimately enhance reintroduction success.

longitudinal variation in community structure of floodplain fishes along two rivers of the southeastern usa,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,GARNETT JA;BATZER DP,"many studies have examined whether longitudinal variation exists in fish communities within stream channels. yet despite the acknowledged importance of adjacent floodplain ecosystems, no study has investigated longitudinal variation in fish communities in floodplain wetlands. we conducted a study to determine if distinct fish communities exist between upper and lower river floodplains. we predicted that floodplains in the upper portions of a watershed will be dominated by opportunistic riverine fish. in contrast, floodplains farther downstream in the watershed will primarily consist of obligate floodplain fishes. we sampled fishes at 21 floodplain sites along the lengths of the oconee-altamaha and broad-savannah river systems of georgia, usa, during the 2008 and 2009 flood seasons. a modified mark-recapture method was utilized to estimate probabilities of species detection and occupancy. ordination and analysis of similarity using species site occupancy estimates identified two unique communities related to floodplain position, and indicator species analysis supported our hypothesis of community distinction based on life history traits. water resource managers should consider how flood pulse character influences fish communities when regulating flow regimes."
"empirical, spatially explicit natural mortality and movement rate estimates for the threatened gulf sturgeon (acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi)",NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,RUDD MB;AHRENS RNM;PINE WE;BOLDEN SK,"understanding mortality rates and movement patterns across a species' distribution can provide key insight necessary for developing effective conservation, recovery, and management plans. we directly estimated site fidelity and natural mortality rates for the threatened gulf sturgeon (acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) across a large portion of their range in the northern gulf of mexico using acoustic telemetry methods and a simulation-tested, multistate mark-recapture model. our results suggest that fidelity rates to riverine habitats used during spring and summer are high, but natural mortality rates vary widely. our results are highly relevant for managing this species. the high fidelity rates, coupled with supporting genetic analyses, suggest that management of individual riverine populations of gulf sturgeon should be considered. the need for individual river-based management is exacerbated by the variation in natural mortality rates among rivers. the reasons for these differences in mortality are unclear, but are an important area of future research because higher mortality rates may impede recovery of some gulf sturgeon populations to stated management targets."
to breed or not to breed: past reproductive status and environmental cues drive current breeding decisions in a long-lived amphibian,iteroparity; survival; skipped breeding; amphibian; multi-event models,OECOLOGIA,CAYUELA H;BESNARD A;BONNAIRE E;PERRET H;RIVOALEN J;MIAUD C;JOLY P,"iteroparity is an adaptive response to uncertainty in reproductive success. however, spreading reproductive success over multiple reproduction events during a lifetime is constrained by adult mortality and the stochasticity associated with interactions between external factors and physiological states. the acquisition of information about environmental conditions during the growth of progeny and sufficient resources during the non-reproductive period are key factors for breeding success. consequently, we hypothesized that long-lived animals may skip a breeding opportunity when information about unfavourable environmental conditions is available. in addition, nutritional constraints could prevent an animal from replenishing its reserves sufficiently to invest in the current breeding period. we investigated these questions using capture-recapture data from a 5-year study on a large population of yellow-bellied toads in a forest in north-eastern france. we took advantage of various advances in multi-state capture-recapture models (e.g. unobservable states and mixture models) to test our hypotheses. our results show that the combined effects of rainfall deficit and the breeding/non-breeding state of individuals during the past breeding season affect breeding probability during the following breeding opportunity. we also found that females breed less frequently than males, suggesting that the overall energy cost of reproduction differs between genders. finally, the results indicate that toad survival appears to be negatively influenced by rainfall deficits. we discuss the yellow-bellied toad's reproductive behaviour in term of bet-hedging strategy and life history trait evolution."

time-location sampling with capture-recapture to assess specialised recreational fisheries,angler; hard-to-reach; innovative; mark-recapture; sport fishing; survey,FISHERIES RESEARCH,ZISCHKE MT;GRIFFITHS SP,"specialisation in recreational fisheries has led to increasing diversification and segmentation of fishers into small 'hard-to-reach' populations that are inherently difficult and costly to sample using traditional methods. in this paper, we quantitatively assess, and expand upon, time-location sampling (tls) for a specialised recreational sport fishery off eastern australia using stratified random sampling of fishing tackle stores as aggregation points for fishers. multiple tls survey events facilitated the use of capture-recapture models to provide a minimum population size estimate of 3185 (se 1338) fishers in the study region in 2010. adopting a questionnaire with a long recall period (e.g. 12 months) may introduce biases in estimates of effort and catch from tls. therefore, these biases were corrected for using a 'benchmark' on-site survey, providing minimum estimates of effort and catch of 172,438 (se 8440) angler hours and 4.7-31.4 (se 2.6-6.8) t for six pelagic species, respectively, in the study region during 2010. tls with capture-recapture is an efficient method for sampling hard-to-reach specialised fishers and may yield annual estimates of population size, effort and catch. further research is needed to refine methods and develop systematic protocols that may be applied to a wide range of hard-to-reach populations, including recreational, artisanal and illegal fisheries.

a viable population of the european red squirrel in an urban park,NA,PLOS ONE,REZOUKI C;DOZIERES A;LE COEUR C;THIBAULT S;PISANU B;CHAPUIS JL;BAUDRY E,"whether urban parks can maintain viable and self-sustaining populations over the long term is questionable. in highly urbanized landscapes, urban parks could play a role in biodiversity conservation by providing habitat and resources to native species. however, populations inhabiting urban parks are usually small and isolated, leading to increased demographic stochasticity and genetic drift, with expected negative consequences on their viability. here, we investigated a european red squirrel population located in an urban park close to paris, france (parc de sceaux; 184 ha) to assess its viability. using mitochondrial d-loop sequences and 13 microsatellite loci, we showed that the population presented high levels of genetic variation and no evidence of inbreeding. the size of the population was estimated at 100-120 individuals based on the comparison of two census techniques, distance sampling and capture-mark-recapture. the estimated heterozygosity level and population size were integrated in a population viability analysis to project the likelihood of the population's persistence over time. results indicate that the red squirrel population of this urban park can be viable on the long term (i.e. 20 years) for a range of realistic demographic parameters (juvenile survival at least >40%) and immigration rates (at least one immigration event every two years). this study highlights that urban parks can be potential suitable refuges for the red squirrel, a locally threatened species across western european countries, provided that ecological corridors are maintained."
exploring heterozygosity-survival correlations in a wild songbird population: contrasting effects between juvenile and adult stages,NA,PLOS ONE,CANAL D;SERRANO D;POTTI J,"the relationship between genetic diversity and fitness, a major issue in evolutionary and conservation biology, is expected to be stronger in traits affected by many loci and those directly influencing fitness. here we explore the influence of heterozygosity measured at 15 neutral markers on individual survival, one of the most important parameters determining individual fitness. we followed individual survival up to recruitment and during subsequent adult life of 863 fledgling pied flycatchers born in two consecutive breeding seasons. mark-recapture analyses showed that individual heterozygosity did not influence juvenile or adult survival. in contrast, the genetic relatedness of parents was negatively associated with the offspring's survival during the adult life, but this effect was not apparent in the juvenile (from fledgling to recruitment) stage. stochastic factors experienced during the first year of life in this long-distance migratory species may have swamped a relationship between heterozygosity and survival up to recruitment."
species distribution models of an endangered rodent offer conflicting measures of habitat quality at multiple scales,dipodomys ingens; giant kangaroo rat; habitat suitability; mark-recapture; maxent; survival,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,BEAN WT;PRUGH LR;STAFFORD R;BUTTERFIELD HS;WESTPHAL M;BRASHARES JS,"1. the high cost of directly measuring habitat quality has led ecologists to test alternate methods for estimating and predicting this critically important ecological variable. in particular, it is frequently assumed but rarely tested that models of habitat suitability ('species distribution models', sdms) may provide useful indices of habitat quality, either from an individual animal or manager's perspective. critically, sdms are increasingly used to estimate species' ranges, with an implicit assumption that areas of high suitability will result in higher probability of persistence. this assumption underlies efforts to use sdms to design protected areas, assess the status of cryptic species or manage responses to climate change. recent tests of this relationship have provided mixed results, suggesting sdms may predict abundance but not other measures of high-quality habitat (e. g. survival, persistence). 2. in this study, we created a suite of sdms for the endangered giant kangaroo rat dipodomys ingens at three distinct scales using the machine-learning method maxent. we compared these models with three measures of habitat quality: survival, abundance and body condition. 3. species distribution models were not correlated with survival, while models at all scales were positively correlated with abundance. finer-scale models were more closely correlated with abundance than the largest scale. body condition was not correlated with habitat suitability at any scale. the inability of models to predict survival may be due to a lack of information in environmental covariates; unmeasured community processes or stochastic events; or the inadequacy of using models that predict species presence to also predict demography. 4. synthesis and applications. species distribution models (sdms), especially fine scale ones, may be useful for longer-term management goals, such as identifying high-quality habitat for protection. however, short-term management decisions should be based only on models that use covariates appropriate for the necessary temporal and spatial scales. assumptions about the relationship between habitat suitability and habitat quality must be made explicit. even then, care should be taken in inferring multiple types of habitat quality from sdms."

a multi-method hierarchical modeling approach to quantifying bias in occupancy from noninvasive genetic tagging studies,camera trapping; monitoring; mustelids; occupancy estimation; spatial distribution,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,FISHER JT;BRADBURY S,"detecting ecological change in mammalian communities requires large volumes of data collected across large landscapes. noninvasive genetic tagging (ngt) can provide such data and is a common method of estimating species occupancy, distribution, and abundance. methods to correct errors in genetic analysis exist, but estimating and accounting for detection error in ngt studiesspecifically, detection error during hair trappinghas received less attention. if detectability varies with an ecological characteristic that is instead attributed to occupancy, detection error may lead to spurious conclusions. we demonstrate how multi-method occupancy models informed by camera-trapping data can quantify error, partition sources of variability, and estimate occupancy from ngt studies. we surveyed marten (martes americana), fisher (pekania pennanti), and wolverine (gulo gulo) occurrence via hair trapping and camera trapping for 3 repeated monthly surveys at 66 sites in the rocky mountains of alberta, canada. camera traps photographed the hair traps and surrounding sampling site. we used multi-method occupancy models to estimate site occupancy, probability of detection, and conditional occupancy at a hair trap. we tested the predictions that detection error in ngt studies could be induced by temporal variability and behavioral variability arising from the presence of heterospecifics. models indicated that ngt via hair trapping consistently underestimated occupancy of marten, fisher, and wolverine compared to cameras. the magnitude of bias varied, but at worst underestimated occupancy by half. the presence of a heterospecific affected a species' detection at hair traps. wolverine presence increased marten detection, whereas marten decreased fisher detection at ngt traps. for all species, detection error was reduced through successive monthly surveys, although heterogeneity induced by other mustelids remained. detection error from multiple sources can bias ngt occupancy estimates, with implications for population estimation, ecological inference, species' legal status assessments, and conservation decisions. we recommend that ngt studies quantify and correct for detection error using independent survey methods and multi-method occupancy models, to improve the ability to answer ecological questions and make conservation decisions in the face of ecological change.

polar bears from space: assessing satellite imagery as a tool to track arctic wildlife,NA,PLOS ONE,STAPLETON S;LARUE M;LECOMTE N;ATKINSON S;GARSHELIS D;PORTER C;ATWOOD T,"development of efficient techniques for monitoring wildlife is a priority in the arctic, where the impacts of climate change are acute and remoteness and logistical constraints hinder access. we evaluated high resolution satellite imagery as a tool to track the distribution and abundance of polar bears. we examined satellite images of a small island in foxe basin, canada, occupied by a high density of bears during the summer ice-free season. bears were distinguished from other light-colored spots by comparing images collected on different dates. a sample of ground-truthed points demonstrated that we accurately classified bears. independent observers reviewed images and a population estimate was obtained using mark-recapture models. this estimate (n : 94; 95% confidence interval: 92-105) was remarkably similar to an abundance estimate derived from a line transect aerial survey conducted a few days earlier (n: 102; 95% ci: 69-152). our findings suggest that satellite imagery is a promising tool for monitoring polar bears on land, with implications for use with other arctic wildlife. large scale applications may require development of automated detection processes to expedite review and analysis. future research should assess the utility of multi-spectral imagery and examine sites with different environmental characteristics."
grass invasion increases top-down pressure on an amphibian via structurally mediated effects on an intraguild predator,anaxyrus americanus; ecosystem engineer; food web; habitat complexity; indirect effects; intraguild predation; invasive; microstegium vimineum; trophic cascade; wolf spider,ECOLOGY,DEVORE JL;MAERZ JC,"plants serve as both basal resources and ecosystem engineers, so plant invasion may exert trophic influences on consumers both via bottom-up processes and by altering the environmental context in which trophic interactions occur. to determine how these mechanisms affect a native predator we used a mark recapture study in eight pairs of 58-m(2) field enclosures to measure the influence of japanese stilt grass invasion on 3200 recently metamorphosed american toads. toad survivorship was lower in invaded habitats despite abiotic effects that favor amphibians. prey densities were also lower in invaded habitats, but growth was unaffected. frequent spider predation events in invaded habitats led us to use factorial field cage manipulations of stilt grass and lycosid spiders to determine if invasion increases predation rates. spiders persisted at higher densities in the presence of stilt grass, and toad survival was lowest in cages with both grass and spiders. invasion alone did not significantly reduce toad survival. our results demonstrate that despite prey reductions and abiotic effects, it is increased spider persistence that reduces toad survival in invaded habitats. invasion therefore affects resident forest floor consumers by modifying trophic interactions between native species, causing structurally mediated reductions in intraguild predation rates among spiders, with cascading implications for toad survival."

experimentally decoupling reproductive investment from energy storage to test the functional basis of a life-history trade-off,anolis; cost of reproduction; energy allocation; estradiol; fat body; lizard; mark-recapture; natural selection; phenotypic manipulation; survival,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,COX RM;LOVERN MB;CALSBEEK R,"the ubiquitous life-history trade-off between reproduction and survival has long been hypothesized to reflect underlying energy-allocation trade-offs between reproductive investment and processes related to self-maintenance. although recent work has questioned whether energy-allocation models provide sufficient explanations for the survival cost of reproduction, direct tests of this hypothesis are rare, especially in wild populations. this hypothesis was tested in a wild population of brown anole lizards (anolis sagrei) using a two-step experiment. first, stepwise variation in reproductive investment was created using unilateral and bilateral ovariectomy (ovx) along with intact (sham) control. next, this manipulation was decoupled from its downstream effects on energy storage by surgically ablating the abdominal fat stores from half of the females in each reproductive treatment. as predicted, unilateral ovx (intermediate reproductive investment) induced levels of growth, body condition, fat storage and breeding-season survival that were intermediate between the high levels of bilateral ovx (no reproductive investment) and the low levels of sham (full reproductive investment). ablation of abdominal fat bodies had a strong and persistent effect on energy stores, but it did not influence post-breeding survival in any of the three reproductive treatments. this suggests that the energetic savings of reduced reproductive investment do not directly enhance post-breeding survival, with the caveat that only one aspect of energy storage was manipulated and ovx itself had no overall effect on post-breeding survival. this study supports the emerging view that simple energy-allocation models may often be insufficient as explanations for the life-history trade-off between reproduction and survival."
large-scale movements in european badgers: has the tail of the movement kernel been underestimated?,btb; btb vaccination; culling; dispersal kernel; landscape scale; mark-recapture; meles meles; sex-biased dispersal; wildlife management,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,BYRNE AW;QUINN JL;O KEEFFE JJ;GREEN S;SLEEMAN DP;MARTIN SW;DAVENPORT J,"characterizing patterns of animal movementis a major aimin population ecology, and yet doing so at an appropriate spatial scale remains a major challenge. estimating the frequency and distances of movements is of particular importance when species are implicated in the transmission of zoonotic diseases. european badgers (meles meles) areclassically viewed as exhibiting limited dispersal, and yet their movements bring them into conflict with farmers due to their potential to spread bovine tuberculosis in parts of their range.considerable uncertainty surrounds themovement potential of badgers, and this may be related tothe spatial scale of previous empirical studies.we conducted a large-scale mark-recapture study (755km2; 2008-2012; 1935 capture events; 963 badgers) to investigate movement patterns in badgers, and undertook a comparative meta-analysis using published data from 15 european populations. the dispersal movement (>1km) kernel followed an inverse power-law function, with a substantial tail' indicating the occurrence of rare long-distance dispersal attempts during the study period. the mean recorded distance from this distribution was 2 center dot 6km, the 95 percentile was 7 center dot 3km and the longest recorded was 22 center dot 1km. dispersal frequency distributions were significantly different between genders; males dispersed more frequently than females, but females made proportionally more long-distance dispersal attempts than males. we used a subsampling approach to demonstrate that the appropriate minimum spatial scale to characterize badger movements in our study population was 80km2, substantially larger than many previous badger studies. furthermore, the meta-analysis indicated a significant association between maximum movement distance and study area size, while controlling for population density. maximum long-distance movements were often only recorded by chance beyond the boundaries of study areas. these findings suggest that the tail of the badger movement distribution is currently underestimated. the implications of this for understanding the spatial ecology of badger populations and for the design of disease intervention strategies are potentially significant."
selection based on the size of the black tie of the great tit may be reversed in urban habitats,divergent selection; parus major; plumage coloration; survival; trap response; urban adaptation,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SENAR JC;CONROY MJ;QUESADA J;MATEOS GONZALEZ F,"a standard approach to model how selection shapes phenotypic traits is the analysis of capture-recapture data relating trait variation to survival. divergent selection, however, has never been analyzed by the capture-recapture approach. most reported examples of differences between urban and nonurban animals reflect behavioral plasticity rather than divergent selection. the aim of this paper was to use a capture-recapture approach to test the hypothesis that divergent selection can also drive local adaptation in urban habitats. we focused on the size of the black breast stripe (i.e., tie width) of the great tit (parus major), a sexual ornament used in mate choice. urban great tits display smaller tie sizes than forest birds. because tie size is mostly genetically determined, it could potentially respond to selection. we analyzed capture/recapture data of male great tits in barcelona city (n = 171) and in a nearby (7 km) forest (n = 324) from 1992 to 2008 using mark. when modelling recapture rate, we found it to be strongly influenced by tie width, so that both for urban and forest habitats, birds with smaller ties were more trap-shy and more cautious than their larger tied counterparts. when modelling survival, we found that survival prospects in forest great tits increased the larger their tie width (i.e., directional positive selection), but the reverse was found for urban birds, with individuals displaying smaller ties showing higher survival (i.e., directional negative selection). as melanin-based tie size seems to be related to personality, and both are heritable, results may be explained by cautious personalities being favored in urban environments. more importantly, our results show that divergent selection can be an important mechanism in local adaptation to urban habitats and that capture-recapture is a powerful tool to test it."
estimating the abundance of rare and elusive carnivores from photographic-sampling data when the population size is very small,camera traps; capture-recapture; heterogeneous detection; small population,POPULATION ECOLOGY,GERBER BD;IVAN JS;BURNHAM KP,"conservation and management agencies require accurate and precise estimates of abundance when considering the status of a species and the need for directed actions. due to the proliferation of remote sampling cameras, there has been an increase in capture-recapture studies that estimate the abundance of rare and/or elusive species using closed capture-recapture estimators (c-r). however, data from these studies often do not meet necessary statistical assumptions. common attributes of these data are (1) infrequent detections, (2) a small number of individuals detected, (3) long survey durations, and (4) variability in detection among individuals. we believe there is a need for guidance when analyzing this type of sparse data. we highlight statistical limitations of closed c-r estimators when data are sparse and suggest an alternative approach over the conventional use of the jackknife estimator. our approach aims to maximize the probability individuals are detected at least once over the entire sampling period, thus making the modeling of variability in the detection process irrelevant, estimating abundance accurately and precisely. we use simulations to demonstrate when using the unconditional-likelihood m (0) (constant detection probability) closed c-r estimator with profile-likelihood confidence intervals provides reliable results even when detection varies by individual. if each individual in the population is detected on average of at least 2.5 times, abundance estimates are accurate and precise. when studies sample the same species at multiple areas or at the same area over time, we suggest sharing detection information across datasets to increase precision when estimating abundance. the approach suggested here should be useful for monitoring small populations of species that are difficult to detect."

"survival, recruitment, and population growth rate of an important mesopredator: the northern raccoon",NA,PLOS ONE,TROYER EM;DEVITT SEC;SUNQUIST ME;GOSWAMI VR;OLI MK,"populations of mesopredators (mid-sized mammalian carnivores) are expanding in size and range amid declining apex predator populations and ever-growing human presence, leading to significant ecological impacts. despite their obvious importance, population dynamics have scarcely been studied for most mesopredator species. information on basic population parameters and processes under a range of conditions is necessary for managing these species. here we investigate survival, recruitment, and population growth rate of a widely distributed and abundant mesopredator, the northern raccoon (procyon lotor), using pradel's temporal symmetry models and >6 years of monthly capture-mark-recapture data collected in a protected area. monthly apparent survival probability was higher for females (0.949, 95% ci = 0.936-0.960) than for males (0.908, 95% ci = 0.893-0.920), while monthly recruitment rate was higher for males (0.091, 95% ci = 0.078-0.106) than for females (0.054, 95% ci = 0.042-0.067). finally, monthly realized population growth rate was 1.000 (95% ci = 0.996-1.004), indicating that our study population has reached a stable equilibrium in this relatively undisturbed habitat. there was little evidence for substantial temporal variation in population growth rate or its components. our study is one of the first to quantify survival, recruitment, and realized population growth rate of raccoons using long-term data and rigorous statistical models."
reliability of different mark-recapture methods for population size estimation tested against reference population sizes constructed from field data,NA,PLOS ONE,GRIMM A;GRUBER B;HENLE K,"reliable estimates of population size are fundamental in many ecological studies and biodiversity conservation. selecting appropriate methods to estimate abundance is often very difficult, especially if data are scarce. most studies concerning the reliability of different estimators used simulation data based on assumptions about capture variability that do not necessarily reflect conditions in natural populations. here, we used data from an intensively studied closed population of the arboreal gecko gehyra variegata to construct reference population sizes for assessing twelve different population size estimators in terms of bias, precision, accuracy, and their 95%-confidence intervals. two of the reference populations reflect natural biological entities, whereas the other reference populations reflect artificial subsets of the population. since individual heterogeneity was assumed, we tested modifications of the lincoln-petersen estimator, a set of models in programs mark and care-2, and a truncated geometric distribution. ranking of methods was similar across criteria. models accounting for individual heterogeneity performed best in all assessment criteria. for populations from heterogeneous habitats without obvious covariates explaining individual heterogeneity, we recommend using the moment estimator or the interpolated jackknife estimator (both implemented in capture/mark). if data for capture frequencies are substantial, we recommend the sample coverage or the estimating equation (both models implemented in care-2). depending on the distribution of catchabilities, our proposed multiple lincoln-petersen and a truncated geometric distribution obtained comparably good results. the former usually resulted in a minimum population size and the latter can be recommended when there is a long tail of low capture probabilities. models with covariates and mixture models performed poorly. our approach identified suitable methods and extended options to evaluate the performance of mark-recapture population size estimators under field conditions, which is essential for selecting an appropriate method and obtaining reliable results in ecology and conservation biology, and thus for sound management."

(jabes, 2009, pp 338-355) suggest a constraint that may be applied to overcome parameter redundancy when it is present in multisite memory models. for this case, we apply symbolic methods to derive a simpler constraint, which allows more parameters to be estimated, and give general results not limited to a particular configuration. we also consider the effect sparse data can have on parameter redundancy and recommend minimum sample sizes. memory models for multisite capture-recapture data can be highly complex and difficult to fit to data. we emphasize the importance of a structured approach to modeling such data, by considering a priori which parameters can be estimated, which constraints are needed in order for estimation to take place, and how much data need to be collected. we also give guidance on the amount of data needed to use two alternative families of tests for whether models for multisite capture-recapture data need to incorporate memory."

marine survival difference between wild and hatchery-reared steelhead trout determined during early downstream migration,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,MELNYCHUK MC;KORMAN J;HAUSCH S;WELCH DW;MCCUBBING DJF;WALTERS CJ,"we observed large survival differences between wild and hatchery-reared steelhead trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) during the juvenile downstream migration immediately after release, which persisted through adult life. following a railway spill of sodium hydroxide into the cheakamus river, british columbia, a short-term conservation hatchery rearing program was implemented for steelhead. we used acoustic telemetry and mark-recapture models to estimate survival of wild and (or) hatchery-reared steelhead during 4 years of the smolt migration, with both groups released in 2008. after adjusting for estimated freshwater residualization, 7%-13% of wild smolts and 30%-40% of hatchery smolts died in the first 3 km of the migration. estimated survival from release to ocean entry was 71%-84% for wild fish and 26%-40% for hatchery fish and to exit from the strait of georgia system was 22%-33% for wild fish and 3.5%-6.7% for hatchery fish. a calculated 2.3-fold survival difference established during the downstream migration was similar to that after the return of adult spawners, as return rates were 8.0% for wild fish and 4.1% for hatchery fish. contrary to current understanding, a large proportion of salmon mortality in the smolt-to-adult period, commonly termed ""marine mortality"", may actually occur prior to ocean entry."
efficiency of electrofishing in turbid lowland rivers: implications for measuring temporal change in fish populations,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,LYON JP;BIRD T;NICOL S;KEARNS J;O MAHONY J;TODD CR;COWX IG;BRADSHAW CJA,"to quantify how electrofishing capture probability varies over time and across physiochemical and disturbance gradients in a turbid lowland river, we tagged between 68 and 95 fish.year(-1) with radio transmitters and up to 424 fish.year(-1) with external and passive integrated transponder (pit) tags. we surveyed the site noninvasively using radiotelemetry to determine which of the radio-tagged fish were present (effectively closing the radio-tagged population to emigration) and then electrofished to estimate the proportion of available fish that were captured based on both this and standard mark-recapture methods. we replicated the electrofishing surveys three times over a minimum of 12 days each year, for 7 years. electrofishing capture probability varied between 0.020 and 0.310 over the 7 years and between four different large-bodied species (murray cod (maccullochella peelii), trout cod (maccullochella macquariensis), golden perch (macquaria ambigua ambigua), and silver perch (bidyanus bidyanus)). river turbidity associated with increased river discharge negatively influenced capture probability. increasing fish length increased detection of fish up to 500 mm for murray cod, after which capture probability decreased. variation in capture probability in large lowland rivers results in additional uncertainty when estimating population size or relative abundance. research and monitoring programs using fish as an indicator should incorporate strategies to lessen potential error that might result from changes in capture probabilities."
monitoring abundance and phenology in (multivoltine) butterfly species: a novel mixture model,ukbms; stopover duration; parameter redundancy; common blue butterfly; super-population; normal mixtures; sample counts,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MATECHOU E;DENNIS EB;FREEMAN SN;BRERETON T,"data from 'citizen science' surveys are increasingly valuable in identifying declines in widespread species, but require special attention in the case of invertebrates, with considerable variation in number, seasonal flight patterns and, potentially, voltinism. there is a need for reliable and more informative methods of inference in such cases. we focus on data consisting of sample counts of individuals that are not uniquely identifiable, collected at one or more sites. arrival or emergence and departure or death of individuals take place during the study. we introduce a new modelling approach, which borrows ideas from the 'stopover' capture-recapture literature, that permits the estimation of parameters of interest, such as mean arrival times and relative abundance, or in some cases, absolute abundance, and the comparison of these between sites. the model is evaluated using an extensive simulation study which demonstrates that the estimates for the parameters of interest obtained by the model are reliable, even when the data sets are sparse, as is often the case in reality. when applied to data for the common blue butterfly polyommatus icarus at a large number of sites, the results suggest that mean emergence times, as well as the relative sizes of the broods, are linked to site northing, and confirm field experience that the species is bivoltine in the south of the uk but practically univoltine in the north. synthesis and applications. our proposed 'stopover' model is parameterized with biologically informative constituents: times of emergence, survival rate and relative brood sizes. estimates of absolute or relative abundance that can be obtained alongside these underlying variables are robust to the presence of missing observations and can be compared in a statistically rigorous framework. these estimates are direct indices of abundance, rather than 'sightings', implicitly adjusted for the possible presence of repeat sightings during a season. at the same time, they provide indices of change in demographic and phenological parameters that may be of use in identifying the factors underlying population change. the model is widely applicable and this will increase the utility of already valuable and influential long-standing surveys in monitoring the effects of environmental change on phenology or abundance."
a simulation study of acoustic-assisted tracking of whales for mark-recapture surveys,NA,PLOS ONE,PEEL D;MILLER BS;KELLY N;DAWSON S;SLOOTEN E;DOUBLE MC,"collecting enough data to obtain reasonable abundance estimates of whales is often difficult, particularly when studying rare species. passive acoustics can be used to detect whale sounds and are increasingly used to estimate whale abundance. much of the existing effort centres on the use of acoustics to estimate abundance directly, e. g. analysing detections in a distance sampling framework. here, we focus on acoustics as a tool incorporated within mark-recapture surveys. in this context, acoustic tools are used to detect and track whales, which are then photographed or biopsied to provide data for mark-recapture analyses. the purpose of incorporating acoustics is to increase the encounter rate beyond using visual searching only. while this general approach is not new, its utility is rarely quantified. this paper predicts the ""acoustically-assisted'' encounter rate using a discrete-time individual-based simulation of whales and survey vessel. we validate the simulation framework using existing data from studies of sperm whales. we then use the framework to predict potential encounter rates in a study of antarctic blue whales. we also investigate the effects of a number of the key parameters on encounter rate. mean encounter rates from the simulation of sperm whales matched well with empirical data. variance of encounter rate, however, was underestimated. the simulation of antarctic blue whales found that passive acoustics should provide a 1.7-3.0 fold increase in encounter rate over visual-only methods. encounter rate was most sensitive to acoustic detection range, followed by vocalisation rate. during survey planning and design, some indication of the relationship between expected sample size and effort is paramount; this simulation framework can be used to predict encounter rates and establish this relationship. for a case in point, the simulation framework indicates unequivocally that real-time acoustic tracking should be considered for quantifying the abundance of antarctic blue whales via mark-recapture methods."

the effects of birth weight and maternal care on survival of juvenile steller sea lions (eumetopias jubatus),NA,PLOS ONE,MANISCALCO JM,"steller sea lions were listed as endangered following a collapse of the western distinct population beginning in the late 1970s. low juvenile survival has been implicated as a factor in the decline. i conducted a multistate mark-recapture analysis to estimate juvenile survival in an area of the western population where sea lions are showing signs of recovery. survival for males and females was 80% between 3 weeks and 1 year of age. approximately 20% of juveniles continued to be nursed by their mothers between ages 1 and 2 and 10% between ages 2 and 3. survival for juveniles that suckled beyond 1 year was 88.2% and 89.9% to ages 2 and 3, respectively. in contrast, survival for individuals weaned by age 1 was 40.6% for males and 64.2% for females between ages 1 and 2. birth mass positively influenced survival for juveniles weaned at age 1 but had little effect on individuals continuing to suckle. cumulative survival to age 4 was double that estimated during the population decline in this region. evidence suggests that western steller sea lions utilize a somewhat different maternal strategy than those in the eastern distinct population. western adult females generally invest more in their pups during the first year but wean offspring by age 1 more often. this results in better survival to age 1, but greater mortality between ages 1 and 3 compared to the eastern population. different maternal strategies may reflect density dependent pressures of populations at opposite levels of abundance."
movement patterns in a partial migrant: a multi-event capture-recapture approach,NA,PLOS ONE,GOURLAY LAROUR ML;PRADEL R;GUILLEMAIN M;GUITTON JS;L HOSTIS M;SANTIN JANIN H;CAIZERGUES A,"partial migration is a pervasive albeit poorly studied phenomenon by which some individuals of a population migrate while others are residents. it has tremendous consequences on seasonal variations of population size/structure and therefore management. using a multi-event capture-mark-recapture/recovery (cmr) approach, we assessed seasonal site occupancy, survival and site fidelity of a partially migratory diving duck, the common pochard (aythya ferina), in an area potentially including both local breeders and winter visitors. the modelling exercise indeed discriminated two different categories of individuals. first, locally breeding females which had a probability of being present in our study area during winter of 0.41. females of this category were found to be more faithful to their breeding site than males (breeding site fidelity probabilities of 1 and 0.11, respectively). the second category of birds were winter visitors, which included adults of both sexes, whose probability of being present in the study area during the breeding season was nil, and young of both sexes with a 0.11 probability of being present in the area during the breeding season. all wintering individuals, among which there was virtually no locally breeding male, displayed a high fidelity to our study area from one winter to the next (0.41-0.43). estimated annual survival rates differed according to age (adults 0.69, young 0.56). for both age classes mortality was higher during late winter/early spring than during summer/early winter. our study is among the first to show how and under which conditions the multi-event approach can be employed for investigating complex movement patterns encountered in partial migrants, providing a convenient tool for overcoming state uncertainty. it also shows why studying patterns of probability of individual presence/movements in partial migrants is a key towards understanding seasonal variations in numbers."
compensatory heterogeneity in spatially explicit capture-recapture data,carnivores; density estimates; dna; effective sampling area; grizzly bear; heterogeneity; home range; secr; sex differences; single-detector sampling area; spatially explicit capture-recapture; ursus arctos,ECOLOGY,EFFORD MG;MOWAT G,"spatially explicit capture-recapture methods, used widely to estimate the abundance of large carnivores, allow for movement within home ranges during sampling. probability of detection is a decreasing function of distance from the home range center, with one parameter for magnitude and another for spatial scale. sex-based and other differences in home range size potentially cause heterogeneity in individual detection and bias in estimates of density. the two parameters of detection have hitherto been treated as independent, but we suggest that an inverse relation is expected when detection probability depends on time spent near the detector. variation in the spatial scale of detection is then compensated by reciprocal variation in the magnitude parameter. we define a net measure of detection (single-detector sampling area, a(0)), and show by simulation that its coefficient of variation (cv) is a better predictor of bias than the cv of either component or the sum of their squared cvs. in an example using the grizzly bear ursus arctos, the estimated sex variation in a(0) was small despite large variation in each component. from the simulations, the relative bias of density estimates was generally negligible (<5%) when cv(a(0)) < 30%. parameterization of the detection model in terms of a(0) and spatial scale can be more parsimonious and significantly aids the biological interpretation of detection parameters."
when is a parasite not a parasite? effects of larval tick burdens on white-footed mouse survival,bayesian analysis; capture-mark-recapture model; ectoparasites; ixodes scapularis; peromyscus leucopus; state-space model; survival,ECOLOGY,HERSH MH;LADEAU SL;PREVITALI MA;OSTFELD RS,"many animal species can carry considerable burdens of ectoparasites: parasites living on the outside of a host's body. ectoparasite infestation can decrease host survival, but the magnitude and even direction of survival effects can vary depending on the type of ectoparasite and the nature and duration of the association. when ectoparasites also serve as vectors of pathogens, the effects of ectoparasite infestation on host survival have the potential to alter disease dynamics by regulating host populations and stabilizing transmission. we quantified the impact of larval ixodes scapularis tick burdens on both within-season and overwinter survival of white-footed mice (peromyscus leucopus) using a hierarchical bayesian capture-mark-recapture model. i. scapularis and p. leucopus are, respectively, vectors and competent reservoirs for the causative agents of lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. using a data set of 5587 individual mouse capture histories over sixteen years, we found little evidence for any effect of tick burdens on either within-season or overwinter mouse survival probabilities. in male mice, tick burdens were positively correlated with within-season survival probabilities. mean maximum tick burdens were also positively correlated with population rates of change during the concurrent breeding season. the apparent indifference of mice to high tick burdens may contribute to their effectiveness as reservoir hosts for several human zoonotic pathogens."

estimating migratory connectivity of birds when re- encounter probabilities are heterogeneous,bird banding laboratory; migratory connectivity; multistate model; nearctic-neotropical migrant; re-encounter probability,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,COHEN EB;HOSTETLER JA;ROYLE JA;MARRA PP,"understanding the biology and conducting effective conservation of migratory species requires an understanding of migratory connectivity - the geographic linkages of populations between stages of the annual cycle. unfortunately, for most species, we are lacking such information. the north american bird banding laboratory (bbl) houses an extensive database of marking, recaptures and recoveries, and such data could provide migratory connectivity information for many species. to date, however, few species have been analyzed for migratory connectivity largely because heterogeneous re-encounter probabilities make interpretation problematic. we accounted for regional variation in re-encounter probabilities by borrowing information across species and by using effort covariates on recapture and recovery probabilities in a multistate capture-recapture and recovery model. the effort covariates were derived from recaptures and recoveries of species within the same regions. we estimated the migratory connectivity for three tern species breeding in north america and over-wintering in the tropics, common (sterna hirundo), roseate (sterna dougallii), and caspian terns (hydroprogne caspia). for western breeding terns, model-derived estimates of migratory connectivity differed considerably from those derived directly from the proportions of re-encounters. conversely, for eastern breeding terns, estimates were merely refined by the inclusion of re-encounter probabilities. in general, eastern breeding terns were strongly connected to eastern south america, and western breeding terns were strongly linked to the more western parts of the nonbreeding range under both models. through simulation, we found this approach is likely useful for many species in the bbl database, although precision improved with higher re-encounter probabilities and stronger migratory connectivity. we describe an approach to deal with the inherent biases in bbl banding and re-encounter data to demonstrate that this large dataset is a valuable source of information about the migratory connectivity of the birds of north america."
probabilistic maturation reaction norms assessed from mark- recaptures of wild fish in their natural habitat,age and size at maturation; growth; life-history evolution; phenotypic plasticity; salmo trutta; survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,OLSEN EM;SERBEZOV D;VOLLESTAD LA,"reaction norms are a valuable tool in evolutionary biology. lately, the probabilistic maturation reaction norm approach, describing probabilities of maturing at combinations of age and body size, has been much applied for testing whether phenotypic changes in exploited populations of fish are mainly plastic or involving an evolutionary component. however, due to typical field data limitations, with imperfect knowledge about individual life histories, this demographic method still needs to be assessed. using 13years of direct mark-recapture observations on individual growth and maturation in an intensively sampled population of brown trout (salmo trutta), we show that the probabilistic maturation reaction norm approach may perform well even if the assumption of equal survival of juvenile and maturing fish does not hold. earlier studies have pointed out that growth effects may confound the interpretation of shifts in maturation reaction norms, because this method in its basic form deals with body size rather than growth. in our case, however, we found that juvenile body size, rather than annual growth, was more strongly associated with maturation. viewed against earlier studies, our results also underscore the challenges of generalizing life-history patterns among species and populations."

"tracking natal dispersal in a coastal population of a migratory songbird using feather stable isotope (delta h-2, delta s-34) tracers",NA,PLOS ONE,HACHE S;HOBSON KA;BAYNE EM;VAN WILGENBURG SL;VILLARD MA,"adult birds tend to show high fidelity to their breeding territory or disperse over relatively short distances. gene flow among avian populations is thus expected to occur primarily through natal dispersal. although natal dispersal is a critical demographic process reflecting the area over which population dynamics take place, low recapture rates of birds breeding for the first time have limited our ability to reliably estimate dispersal rates and distances. stable isotope approaches can elucidate origins of unmarked birds and so we generated year-and age-specific delta h-2 and delta s-34 feather isoscapes (ca. 180 000 km(2)) of coastal-breeding ovenbirds (seiurus aurocapilla) and used bivariate probability density functions to assign the likely natal areas of 35 males recruited as first-year breeders into a population located in northwestern new brunswick, canada. most individuals (80-94% depending on the magnitude of an age correction factor used; i.e. 28-33 out of 35) were classified as residents (i.e. fledged within our study area) and estimated minimum dispersal distances of immigrants were between 40 and 240 km. even when considering maximum dispersal distances, the likely origin of most first-year breeders was<200 km from our study area. our method identified recruitment into our population from large geographic areas with relatively few samples whereas previous mark-recapture based methods have required orders of magnitude more individuals to describe dispersal at such geographic scales. natal dispersal movements revealed here suggest the spatial scale over which many population processes are taking place and we suggest that conservation plans aiming to maintain populations of ovenbirds and ecologically-similar species should consider management units within 100 or at most 200 km of target breeding populations."

climate driven life histories: the case of the mediterranean storm petrel,NA,PLOS ONE,SOLDATINI C;ALBORES BARAJAS YV;MASSA B;GIMENEZ O,"seabirds are affected by changes in the marine ecosystem. the influence of climatic factors on marine food webs can be reflected in long-term seabird population changes. we modelled the survival and recruitment of the mediterranean storm petrel (hydrobates pelagicus melitensis) using a 21-year mark-recapture dataset involving almost 5000 birds. we demonstrated a strong influence of prebreeding climatic conditions on recruitment age and of rainfall and breeding period conditions on juvenile survival. the results suggest that the juvenile survival rate of the mediterranean subspecies may not be negatively affected by the predicted features of climate change, i.e., warmer summers and lower rainfall. based on considerations of winter conditions in different parts of the mediterranean, we were able to draw inferences about the wintering areas of the species for the first time."

sex ratio bias and extinction risk in an isolated population of tuatara (sphenodon punctatus),NA,PLOS ONE,GRAYSON KL;MITCHELL NJ;MONKS JM;KEALL SN;WILSON JN;NELSON NJ,"understanding the mechanisms underlying population declines is critical for preventing the extinction of endangered populations. positive feedbacks can hasten the process of collapse and create an 'extinction vortex,' particularly in small, isolated populations. we provide a case study of a male-biased sex ratio creating the conditions for extinction in a natural population of tuatara (sphenodon punctatus) on north brother island in the cook strait of new zealand. we combine data from long term mark-recapture surveys, updated model estimates of hatchling sex ratio, and population viability modeling to measure the impacts of sex ratio skew. results from the mark-recapture surveys show an increasing decline in the percentage of females in the adult tuatara population. our monitoring reveals compounding impacts on female fitness through reductions in female body condition, fecundity, and survival as the male-bias in the population has increased. additionally, we find that current nest temperatures are likely to result in more male than female hatchlings, owing to the pattern of temperature-dependent sex determination in tuatara where males hatch at warmer temperatures. anthropogenic climate change worsens the situation for this isolated population, as projected temperature increases for new zealand are expected to further skew the hatchling sex ratio towards males. population viability models predict that without management intervention or an evolutionary response, the population will ultimately become entirely comprised of males and functionally extinct. our study demonstrates that sex ratio bias can be an underappreciated threat to population viability, particularly in populations of long-lived organisms that appear numerically stable."
use of posterior predictive checks as an inferential tool for investigating individual heterogeneity in animal population vital rates,bayesian inference; dynamic heterogeneity; fixed heterogeneity; individual variation; leptonychotes weddellii; model checking; posterior predictive checking; state-space models,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CHAMBERT T;ROTELLA JJ;HIGGS MD,"the investigation of individual heterogeneity in vital rates has recently received growing attention among population ecologists. individual heterogeneity in wild animal populations has been accounted for and quantified by including individually varying effects in models for mark-recapture data, but the real need for underlying individual effects to account for observed levels of individual variation has recently been questioned by the work of tuljapurkar et al. (ecology letters, 12, 93, 2009) on dynamic heterogeneity. model-selection approaches based on information criteria or bayes factors have been used to address this question. here, we suggest that, in addition to model-selection, model-checking methods can provide additional important insights to tackle this issue, as they allow one to evaluate a model's misfit in terms of ecologically meaningful measures. specifically, we propose the use of posterior predictive checks to explicitly assess discrepancies between a model and the data, and we explain how to incorporate model checking into the inferential process used to assess the practical implications of ignoring individual heterogeneity. posterior predictive checking is a straightforward and flexible approach for performing model checks in a bayesian framework that is based on comparisons of observed data to model-generated replications of the data, where parameter uncertainty is incorporated through use of the posterior distribution. if discrepancy measures are chosen carefully and are relevant to the scientific context, posterior predictive checks can provide important information allowing for more efficient model refinement. we illustrate this approach using analyses of vital rates with long-term mark-recapture data for weddell seals and emphasize its utility for identifying shortfalls or successes of a model at representing a biological process or pattern of interest."
"mark recapture estimates of dispersal ability and observations on the territorial behaviour of the rare hoverfly, hammerschmidtia ferruginea (diptera, syrphidae)",saproxylic; populus tremula; mate seeking; distribution,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,ROTHERAY EL;BUSSIERE LF;MOORE P;BERGSTROM L;GOULSON D,"in order to effectively manage habitat for fragmented populations, we need to know details of resource utilisation, and the capacity of species to colonise unoccupied habitat patches. dispersal is vital in maintaining viable populations in increasingly fragmented environments by allowing re-colonisation of areas in which populations have gone extinct. in the uk, the endangered aspen hoverfly hammerschmidtia ferruginea (fall,n 1817) (diptera, syrphidae) depends on a limited and transient breeding habitat: decaying aspen wood populus tremula l. (salicaceae). conservation management for h. ferruginea involves encouraging aspen expansion across scotland, and ensuring retention, maintenance and continuity of dead wood where h. ferruginea has been recorded and in areas that may link populations. in order to do this effectively we need to know how far h. ferruginea can disperse. by taking advantage of the tendency of adults to group on decaying aspen logs, we estimated dispersal ability through mark recapture techniques. in the first year, 1,066 flies were marked as they emerged from aspen logs and 78 were re-sighted at artificially-placed decaying aspen logs up to 4 km from the release site. in the second year, of 1,157 individually marked flies, 112 were re-sighted and one was observed 5 km from the release site. territorial behaviour was recorded at all (19) decaying aspen log locations. in total, 72 males were recorded defending territories, which overlapped with 68 % of recorded female oviposition sites. among males only, wing length was positively associated with dispersal. while these results show h. ferruginea is capable of locating decaying logs up to 5 km away, most dispersing individuals (68 %) were recorded at 1 km, which should be taken into account in developing management protocols. if enough dead wood is available it should be distributed within a radius of 1-2 km, and where possible, as stepping-stones linking up aspen woodlands. we discuss the implications of our findings for the natural history of this species, and make recommendations for its conservation management."
population dynamics of reintroduced gunnison's prairie dogs in the southern portion of their range,burrowing mammals; conservation; cynomys gunnisoni; grassland; reintroduction; restoration; survival; translocations,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,DAVIDSON AD;FRIGGENS MT;SHOEMAKER KT;HAYES CL;ERZ J;DURAN R,"burrowing, herbivorous mammals play important roles as ecosystem engineers and keystone species of grassland ecosystems around the world, but populations of many species have declined dramatically because of myriad threats from human activities. prairie dogs (cynomys spp.) play important roles in shaping the central grasslands of north america, and have declined by about 98% across their range, with consequent losses in associated species and grassland habitat. this has prompted much interest in restoring their populations to protected areas. managers lack a clear understanding of the long-term success of reintroductions, however, and how success may vary across different species of prairie dogs and their widespread geographic ranges. we reintroduced over 1,000 gunnison's prairie dogs (c. gunnisoni) to a semiarid grassland ecosystem in the southern portion of their range in central new mexico, usa, and used standard capture-recapture methods to study their population dynamics over a period of 8 years. mean adult survival was 27% over the course of the study, with precipitation identified as the primary driver of survival. estimated survival was below 12% during severe drought periods and during the first few years following initial reintroduction, the latter likely because of high predation. consequently, multiple releases of animals were required to prevent extirpation, and the long-term sustainability of this population remains questionable. over the 8 years of our study, our site experienced 4 severe droughts during spring, the key period for prairie dog mating, pregnancy, and lactation. production of offspring at the site was low, likely because of the dry and variable conditions that occurred. we show that prairie dog restoration in semi-arid grassland environments that are typical of the lower elevations and southern extent of their range may not succeed in producing viable colonies, and that dedicated management for multiple years is needed to counteract periods of slow or negative population growth. our findings underscore the importance of maintaining and expanding existing colonies wherever possible in these more arid regions, and suggest that reintroductions should be treated as a secondary management strategy. our work also reveals the high vulnerability of prairie dog population extinction due to drought, which has important implications for gunnison's prairie dog conservation under a warming and drying climate.

does seasonality drive spatial patterns in demography? variation in survival in african reed warblers acrocephalus baeticatus across southern africa does not reflect global patterns,avian life history; capture-mark-recapture; jags; multistate state-space; seasonality; spatial variation,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,JANSEN DYM;ABADI F;HAREBOTTLE D;ALTWEGG R,"among birds, northern temperate species generally have larger clutches, shorter development periods and lower adult survival than similarly-sized southern and tropical species. even though this global pattern is well accepted, the driving mechanism is still not fully understood. the main theories are founded on the differing environmental seasonality of these zones (higher seasonality in the north). these patterns arise in cross-species comparisons, but we hypothesized that the same patterns should arise among populations within a species if different types of seasonality select for different life histories. few studies have examined this. we estimated survival of an azonal habitat specialist, the african reed warbler, across the environmentally diverse african subcontinent, and related survival to latitude and to the seasonality of the different environments of their breeding habitats. data (1998-2010) collected through a public ringing scheme were analyzed with hierarchical capture-mark-recapture models to determine resident adult survival and its spatial variance across sixteen vegetation units spread across four biomes. the models were defined as state-space multi-state models to account for transience and implemented in a bayesian framework. we did not find a latitudinal trend in survival or a clear link between seasonality and survival. spatial variation in survival was substantial across the sixteen sites (spatial standard deviation of the logit mean survival: 0.70, 95% credible interval (cri): 0.33-1.27). mean site survival ranged from 0.49 (95% cri: 0.18-0.80) to 0.83 (95% cri: 0.62-0.97) with an overall mean of 0.67 (95% cri: 0.47-0.85). a hierarchical modeling approach enabled us to estimate spatial variation in survival of the african reed warbler across the african subcontinent from sparse data. although we could not confirm the global pattern of higher survival in less seasonal environments, our findings from a poorly studied region contribute to the study of life-history strategies."

animal reintroductions: an innovative assessment of survival,adaptive management; anaxyrus boreas; rocky mountain national park; multistate robust design,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,MUTHS E;BAILEY LL;WATRY MK,"quantitative evaluations of reintroductions are infrequent and assessments of milestones reached before a project is completed, or abandoned due to lack of funding, are rare. however, such assessments, which are promoted in adaptive management frameworks, are critical. quantification can provide defensible estimates of biological success, such as the number of survivors from a released cohort, with associated cost per animal. it is unlikely that the global issues of endangered wildlife and population declines will abate, therefore, assurance colonies and reintroductions are likely to become more common. if such endeavors are to be successful biologically or achieve adequate funding, implementation must be more rigorous and accountable. we use a novel application of a multistate, robust design capture-recapture model to estimate survival of reintroduced tadpoles through metamorphosis (i.e., the number of individuals emerging from the pond) and thereby provide a quantitative measure of effort and success for an ""in progress"" reintroduction of toads. our data also suggest that tadpoles released at later developmental stages have an increased probability of survival and that eggs laid in the wild hatched at higher rates than eggs laid by captive toads. we illustrate how an interim assessment can identify problems, highlight successes, and provide information for use in adjusting the effort or implementing a decision-theoretic adaptive management strategy. published by elsevier ltd."
coastal nurseries and their importance for conservation of sea kraits,NA,PLOS ONE,BONNET X;BRISCHOUX F;BONNET C;PLICHON P;FAUVEL T,"destruction and pollution of coral reefs threaten these marine biodiversity hot stops which shelter more than two thirds of sea snake species. notably, in many coral reef ecosystems of the western pacific ocean, large populations of sea kraits (amphibious sea snakes) have drastically declined during the past three decades. protecting remaining healthy populations is thus essential. in new caledonia, coral reefs shelter numerous sea krait colonies spread throughout an immense lagoon (24,000 km(2)). sea kraits feed on coral fish but lay their eggs on land. however, ecological information on reproduction and juveniles is extremely fragmentary, precluding protection of key habitats for reproduction. our 10 years mark recapture study on yellow sea kraits (l. saintgironsi >8,700 individuals marked) revealed that most neonates aggregate in highly localized coastal sites, where they feed and grow during several months before dispersal. hundreds of females emigrate seasonally from remote populations (>50 km away) to lay their eggs in these coastal nurseries, and then return home. protecting these nurseries is a priority to maintain recruitment rate, and to retain sea krait populations in the future."

application of the genetic mark-recapture technique for run size estimation of yukon river chinook salmon,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HAMAZAKI T;DECOVICH N,"we present an application of the genetic mark-recapture technique to estimate salmon run size in a large river. application of this technique requires modifications to estimation methodology. under a typical lincoln-petersen mark-recapture estimation of salmon run size (n = m/p), individual fish are captured and marked (m) in the lower river and are recaptured (m) at escapement (e: the number of fish reached spawning ground) monitoring sites selected upriver where the proportion of marked individuals (p = m/e) is estimated. in this genetic mark-recapture technique, the marked individuals are not captured and recaptured, but rather the naturally distinctive genetic (marked) population is captured and recaptured. genetically, the lower river population is a mixture of multiple genetic stocks, whereas the upriver escapement population consists of a single genetic stock. hence, the mark-recapture experiment (n = m/p(m)) is reversed. the proportion of ""marked"" genetic stock (p(m)) is estimated in the lower river, and size of the ""marked"" stock in the lower river (m) is estimated by summing its upriver escapement (e-m) and harvest (c-m) between the lower and upper portions of river (m = e-m+c-m). the harvest is calculated as a product of total upriver harvest (c) and the proportion of the ""marked"" stock (p(cm)) in the harvest (c-m = c center dot p(cm)). further, when the proportion of multiple genetic stocks (p(k)) is identified, stock-specific run size (n-k = n center dot p(k)), escapement (e-k = n-k-c-k, where c-k = c center dot p(ck)), and exploitation rate (ex(k) = c-k /n-k) can also be estimated, which provides substantially more information than does the conventional approach. we illustrate an application of this technique for estimating run size of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the yukon river, alaska. received june 6, 2013; accepted november 20, 2013"

effects of exploitation on an overabundant species: the lesser snow goose predicament,harvest; additive mortality; chen caerulescens caerulescens; compensatory mortality; native invasive species; cause-specific mortality; capture-mark-recapture; population control,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,KOONS DN;ROCKWELL RF;AUBRY LM,"invasive and overabundant species are an increasing threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning world-wide. as such, large amounts of money are spent each year on attempts to control them. these efforts can, however, be thwarted if exploitation is compensated demographically or if populations simply become too numerous for management to elicit an effective and rapid functional response. we examined the influence of these mechanisms on cause-specific mortality in lesser snow geese using multistate capture-reencounter methods. the abundance and destructive foraging behaviours of snow geese have created a trophic cascade that reduces (sub-) arctic plant, insect and avian biodiversity, bestowing them the status of 'overabundant'. historically, juvenile snow geese suffered from density-related degradation of their saltmarsh brood-rearing habitat. this allowed harvest mortality to be partially compensated by non-harvest mortality (process correlation between mortality sources: rho=-0 center dot 47; 90% bci: -0 center dot 72 to -0 center dot 04). snow goose family groups eventually responded to their own degradation of habitat by dispersing to non-degraded areas. this relaxed the pressure of density dependence on juvenile birds, but without this mechanism for compensation, harvest began to have an additive effect on overall mortality (rho=0 center dot 60; 90% bci: -0 center dot 06 to 0 center dot 81). in adults, harvest had an additive effect on overall mortality throughout the 42-year study (rho=0 center dot 24; 90% bci: -0 center dot 59 to 0 center dot 67). with the aim of controlling overabundant snow geese, the conservation order amendment to the international migratory bird treaty was implemented in february of 1999 to allow for harvest regulations that had not been allowed since the early 1900s (e.g. a spring harvest season, high or unlimited bag limits and use of electronic calls and unplugged shotguns). although harvest mortality momentarily increased following these actions, the increasing abundance of snow geese has since induced a state of satiation in harvest that has driven harvest rates below the long-term average. more aggressive actions will thus be needed to halt the growth and spread of the devastating trophic cascade that snow geese have triggered. our approach to investigating the impacts of population control efforts on cause-specific mortality will help guide more effective management of invasive and overabundant species world-wide."
assessing sex-related chick provisioning in greater flamingo phoenicopterus roseus parents using capture-recapture models,waterbirds; multistate capture-recapture models; stable isotopes; sexual size dimorphism; sexual segregation; parental care; foraging ecology,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,RENDON MA;GARRIDO A;RENDON MARTOS M;RAMIREZ JM;AMAT JA,"in sexually dimorphic species, the parental effort of the smaller sex may be reduced due to competitive exclusion in the feeding areas by the larger sex or physiological constraints. however, to determine gender effects on provisioning patterns, other intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting parental effort should be accounted for. greater flamingos (phoenicopterus roseus) exhibit sexual size dimorphism. in fuente de piedra colony, the lake dries out almost completely during the breeding season and both parents commute between breeding and foraging sites >130km away during the chick-rearing period. applying multistate capture-recapture models to daily observations of marked parents, we determined the effects of sex, and their interactions with other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, on the probability of chick desertion and sojourn in the colony and feeding areas. moreover, using stable isotopes in the secretions that parents produce to feed their chicks, we evaluated sex-specific use of wetlands. the probability of chick attendance (complementary to chick desertion) was >0 center dot 98. chick desertion was independent of parental sex, but decreased with parental age. females stayed in the feeding areas for shorter periods [mean: 7 center dot 5 (95% ci: 6 center dot 0-9 center dot 4) days] than males [9 center dot 2 (7 center dot 3-11 center dot 8) days]. isotopic signatures of secretions did not show sex differences in delta c-13, but males' secretions were enriched in delta n-15, suggesting they fed on prey of higher trophic levels than females. both parents spent approximately 1day in the colony, but females prolonged their mean stay when the lake dried out. females also allocated more time to foraging in the flooded areas remaining in the colony, likely because they were energetically more stressed than males. the results indicate that sex-specific provisioning behaviour in greater flamingo is related to differential effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. males seem forage less efficiently than females, whereas females' body condition seems to be lower after feeding the chick. our methodology may be extended to species that feed on distant food sources and that do not visit their offspring daily, to elucidate patterns of chick-provisioning behaviour."

trap configuration and spacing influences parameter estimates in spatial capture-recapture models,NA,PLOS ONE,SUN CC;FULLER AK;ROYLE JA,"an increasing number of studies employ spatial capture-recapture models to estimate population size, but there has been limited research on how different spatial sampling designs and trap configurations influence parameter estimators. spatial capture-recapture models provide an advantage over non-spatial models by explicitly accounting for heterogeneous detection probabilities among individuals that arise due to the spatial organization of individuals relative to sampling devices. we simulated black bear (ursus americanus) populations and spatial capture-recapture data to evaluate the influence of trap configuration and trap spacing on estimates of population size and a spatial scale parameter, sigma, that relates to home range size. we varied detection probability and home range size, and considered three trap configurations common to large-mammal mark-recapture studies: regular spacing, clustered, and a temporal sequence of different cluster configurations (i.e., trap relocation). we explored trap spacing and number of traps per cluster by varying the number of traps. the clustered arrangement performed well when detection rates were low, and provides for easier field implementation than the sequential trap arrangement. however, performance differences between trap configurations diminished as home range size increased. our simulations suggest it is important to consider trap spacing relative to home range sizes, with traps ideally spaced no more than twice the spatial scale parameter. while spatial capture-recapture models can accommodate different sampling designs and still estimate parameters with accuracy and precision, our simulations demonstrate that aspects of sampling design, namely trap configuration and spacing, must consider study area size, ranges of individual movement, and home range sizes in the study population."
fine-scale genetic structure and cryptic associations reveal evidence of kin-based sociality in the african forest elephant,NA,PLOS ONE,SCHUTTLER SG;PHILBRICK JA;JEFFERY KJ;EGGERT LS,"spatial patterns of relatedness within animal populations are important in the evolution of mating and social systems, and have the potential to reveal information on species that are difficult to observe in the wild. this study examines the fine-scale genetic structure and connectivity of groups within african forest elephants, loxodonta cyclotis, which are often difficult to observe due to forest habitat. we tested the hypothesis that genetic similarity will decline with increasing geographic distance, as we expect kin to be in closer proximity, using spatial autocorrelation analyses and tau k-r tests. associations between individuals were investigated through a non-invasive genetic capture-recapture approach using network models, and were predicted to be more extensive than the small groups found in observational studies, similar to fission-fusion sociality found in african savanna (loxodonta africana) and asian (elephas maximus) species. dung samples were collected in lope national park, gabon in 2008 and 2010 and genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci, genetically sexed, and sequenced at the mitochondrial dna control region. we conducted analyses on samples collected at three different temporal scales: a day, within six-day sampling sessions, and within each year. spatial autocorrelation and tau k-r tests revealed genetic structure, but results were weak and inconsistent between sampling sessions. positive spatial autocorrelation was found in distance classes of 0-5 km, and was strongest for the single day session. despite weak genetic structure, individuals within groups were significantly more related to each other than to individuals between groups. social networks revealed some components to have large, extensive groups of up to 22 individuals, and most groups were composed of individuals of the same matriline. although fine-scale population genetic structure was weak, forest elephants are typically found in groups consisting of kin and based on matrilines, with some individuals having more associates than observed from group sizes alone."

factors influencing survival of canada geese breeding in southern quebec,age; body condition; branta canadensis maxima; harvest distribution; hatching date; quebec; survival; temperate-nesting canada goose,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,PILOTTE C;REED ET;RODRIGUE J;GIROUX JF,"temperate nesting canada geese are considered a nuisance in many regions of eastern north america. in southern quebec, a breeding population became established 20 years ago and has grown steadily since that time. because of the long-lived nature of geese, understanding the factors that influence annual survival is critical to the management of these populations. our objectives were to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of the harvest of canada geese that breed in southern quebec, determine how year, sex, and age affect survival rates, and to evaluate the effects of hatch date and body condition near fledging on juvenile survival. we conducted mixed live recapture and dead recovery capture-mark-recapture analyses using data from birds banded as pre-fledged juveniles between 2003 and 2009 (n=3,972). recoveries were distributed near the breeding area and along the east coast of the united states. juveniles were mainly recovered in quebec and yearlings in the united states. harvest during the special early hunting season in quebec represented only 9% of the total harvest. annual survival rates were similar for both males and females, but varied among years for each age class. survival averaged 0.82 (95% ci 0.76-0.87) for juveniles, 0.76 (0.69-0.82) for yearlings, and 0.82 (0.75-0.87) for adults. we observed a negative relationship between hatch date and juvenile survival but did not find significant effects of body condition and age at banding on survival. in addition to a short migration, a possible explanation for the high survival of juveniles includes the use by family groups predominantly of areas that are not open to hunting. the use of rural habitats where susceptibility to hunting is high, combined with the behavior of molt migration could explain the lower survival rates of yearlings than juveniles. we argue that high survival rates for all age classes contribute significantly to the growth of this population.

relative survival of gags mycteroperca microlepis released within a recreational hook-and-line fishery: application of the cox regression model to control for heterogeneity in a large-scale mark-recapture study,gag mycteroperca microlepis; proportional hazards model; discard mortality; mark-recapture; recreational fishery,FISHERIES RESEARCH,SAULS B,"from june 2009 through december 2012 fishery observers were placed on charter and headboat vessels operating in the gulf of mexico to directly observe reef fishes as they were caught by recreational anglers fishing with hook-and-line gear. the objective of this study was to relate injuries and impairments measured directly from gags mycteroperca microlepis caught and released within the recreational fishery to subsequent mark-recapture rates. due to the large spatial and temporal scales of the study design, it could not be assumed that encounter probabilities were equal for all individual tagged fish in the population. also, changes in fishing effort following the deepwater horizon oil spill during 2010 in the gulf of mexico and drastically reduced recreational harvest seasons for gag during 2011 and 2012 were unanticipated during the design of this study. therefore, it was necessary to control for potential covariates on encounter and recapture rates for gags tagged in different regions, different years, and different times of year. this analysis demonstrates the utility of the cox regression proportional hazards model in comparing relative survival among gags released in various conditions while controlling for potential covariates on both the occurrence and timing of recapture events. a total of 3954 gags were observed in this study, and the majority (77.26%) were released in good condition (condition category 1), defined as fish that immediately submerged without assistance from venting and had not suffered internal injuries from embedded hooks or visible damage to the gills. however, compared to gags caught in shallower depths, a greater proportion of gags caught and released from depths deeper than 30 m were in fair or poor condition. relative survival was significantly reduced (alpha <0.05) for gags released in fair and poor condition after controlling for variable mark-recapture rates among regions and across months and years when tagged fish were initially captured and released. gags released within the recreational fishery in fair and poor condition were only 66.4% (95% c.i. 46.9-94.0%) and 50.6% (26.2-97.8%) as likely to be recaptured, respectively, as gags released in good condition. overall discard mortality was calculated for gags released in all condition categories at 10 m depth intervals. there was a significant linear increase in estimated mortality from less than 15% (range of uncertainty, 0.1-25.2%) in shallow depths to 30 m, to 35.6% (5.6-55.7%) at depths greater than 70 m (p < 0.001, r-2 = 0.917) (c) 2013 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

effects of red-backed salamanders on ecosystem functions,NA,PLOS ONE,HOCKING DJ;BABBITT KJ,"ecosystems provide a vast array of services for human societies, but understanding how various organisms contribute to the functions that maintain these services remains an important ecological challenge. predators can affect ecosystem functions through a combination of top-down trophic cascades and bottom-up effects on nutrient dynamics. as the most abundant vertebrate predator in many eastern us forests, woodland salamanders (plethodon spp.) likely affect ecosystems functions. we examined the effects of red-backed salamanders (plethodon cinereus) on a variety of forest ecosystem functions using a combined approach of large-scale salamander removals (314-m(2) plots) and small-scale enclosures (2 m(2)) where we explicitly manipulated salamander density (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 m(-2)). in these experiments, we measured the rates of litter and wood decomposition, potential nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, acorn germination, and foliar insect damage on red oak seedlings. across both experimental venues, we found no significant effect of red-backed salamanders on any of the ecosystem functions. we also found no effect of salamanders on intraguild predator abundance (carabid beetles, centipedes, spiders). our study adds to the already conflicting evidence on effects of red-backed salamander and other amphibians on terrestrial ecosystem functions. it appears likely that the impact of terrestrial amphibians on ecosystem functions is context dependent. future research would benefit from explicitly examining terrestrial amphibian effects on ecosystem functions under a variety of environmental conditions and in different forest types."
abundance and survival rates of the hawai'i island associated spinner dolphin (stenella longirostris) stock,NA,PLOS ONE,TYNE JA;POLLOCK KH;JOHNSTON DW;BEJDER L,"reliable population estimates are critical to implement effective management strategies. the hawai'i island spinner dolphin (stenella longirostris) is a genetically distinct stock that displays a rigid daily behavioural pattern, foraging offshore at night and resting in sheltered bays during the day. consequently, they are exposed to frequent human interactions and disturbance. we estimated population parameters of this spinner dolphin stock using a systematic sampling design and capture-recapture models. from september 2010 to august 2011, boat-based photo-identification surveys were undertaken monthly over 132 days (>1,150 hours of effort; >100,000 dorsal fin images) in the four main resting bays along the kona coast, hawai'i island. all images were graded according to photographic quality and distinctiveness. over 32,000 images were included in the analyses, from which 607 distinctive individuals were catalogued and 214 were highly distinctive. two independent estimates of the proportion of highly distinctive individuals in the population were not significantly different (p = 0.68). individual heterogeneity and time variation in capture probabilities were strongly indicated for these data; therefore capture-recapture models allowing for these variations were used. the estimated annual apparent survival rate (product of true survival and permanent emigration) was 0.97 se +/- 0.05. open and closed capture-recapture models for the highly distinctive individuals photographed at least once each month produced similar abundance estimates. an estimate of 221 +/- 4.3 se highly distinctive spinner dolphins, resulted in a total abundance of 631 +/- 60.1 se, (95% ci 524-761) spinner dolphins in the hawai'i island stock, which is lower than previous estimates. when this abundance estimate is considered alongside the rigid daily behavioural pattern, genetic distinctiveness, and the ease of human access to spinner dolphins in their preferred resting habitats, this hawai'i island stock is likely more vulnerable to negative impacts from human disturbance than previously believed."

the proximate causes of sexual size dimorphism in phrynocephalus przewalskii,NA,PLOS ONE,ZHAO W;LIU NF,"sexual size dimorphism (ssd) is a common phenomenon and is a central topic in evolutionary biology. recently, the importance of pursuing an ontogenetic perspective of ssd has been emphasized, to elucidate the proximate physiological mechanisms leading to its evolution. however, such research has seldom focused on the critical periods when males and females diverge. using mark-recapture data, we investigated the development of ssd, sex-specific survivorship, and growth rates in phrynocephalus przewalskii (agamidae). we demonstrated that both male and female lizards are reproductively mature at age 10-11 months (including 5 months hibernation). male-biased ssd in snout-vent length (svl) was only found in adults and was fully expressed at age 11 months (june of the first full season of activity), just after sexual maturation. however, male-biased ssd in tail length (tl), hind-limb length (ll), and head width (hw) were fully expressed at age 9-10 months, just before sexual maturation. analysis of age-specific linear growth rates identified sexually dimorphic growth during the fifth growth month (age 10-11 months) as the proximate cause of ssd in svl. the males experienced higher mortality than females in the first 2 years and only survived better than females after ssd was well developed. this suggests that the critical period of divergence in the sizes of male and female p. przewalskii occurs between 10 and 11 months of age (may to june during the first full season of activity), and that the sexual difference in growth during this period is the proximate cause. however, the sexual difference in survivorship cannot explain the male-biased ssd in svl. our results indicate that performance-related characteristics, such as tl, hw, and ll diverged earlier than svl. the physiological mechanisms underlying the different growth patterns of males and females may reflect different energy allocations associated with their different reproductive statuses."
seasonal survival probabilities suggest low migration mortality in migrating bats,NA,PLOS ONE,GIAVI S;MORETTI M;BONTADINA F;ZAMBELLI N;SCHAUB M,"migration is adaptive if survival benefits are larger than costs of residency. many aspects of bat migration ecology such as migratory costs, stopover site use and fidelity are largely unknown. since many migrating bats are endangered, such information is urgently needed to promote conservation. we selected the migrating leisler's bat (nyctalus leisleri) as model species and collected capture-recapture data in southern switzerland year round during 6 years. we estimated seasonal survival and site fidelity with cormack-jolly-seber models that accounted for the presence of transients fitted with bayesian methods and assessed differences between sexes and seasons. activity peaked in autumn and spring, whereas very few individuals were caught during summer. we hypothesize that the study site is a migratory stopover site used during fall and spring migration for most individuals, but there is also evidence for wintering. additionally, we found strong clues for mating during fall. summer survival that included two major migratory journeys was identical to winter survival in males and slightly higher in females, suggesting that the migratory journeys did not bear significant costs in terms of survival. transience probability was in both seasons higher in males than in females. our results suggest that, similarly to birds, leisler's bat also use stopover sites during migration with high site fidelity. in contrast to most birds, the stopover site was also used for mating and migratory costs in terms of survival seemed to be low. transients' analyses highlighted strong individual variation in site use which makes particularly challenging the study and modelling of their populations as well as their conservation."
growth and maximum size of tiger sharks (galeocerdo cuvier) in hawaii,NA,PLOS ONE,MEYER CG;O MALLEY JM;PAPASTAMATIOU YP;DALE JJ;HUTCHINSON MR;ANDERSON JM;ROYER MA;HOLLAND KN,"tiger sharks (galecerdo cuvier) are apex predators characterized by their broad diet, large size and rapid growth. tiger shark maximum size is typically between 380 & 450 cm total length (tl), with a few individuals reaching 550 cm tl, but the maximum size of tiger sharks in hawaii waters remains uncertain. a previous study suggested tiger sharks grow rather slowly in hawaii compared to other regions, but this may have been an artifact of the method used to estimate growth (unvalidated vertebral ring counts) compounded by small sample size and narrow size range. since 1993, the university of hawaii has conducted a research program aimed at elucidating tiger shark biology, and to date 420 tiger sharks have been tagged and 50 recaptured. all recaptures were from hawaii except a single shark recaptured off isla jacques cousteau (24 degrees 13'17 '' n 109 degrees 52'14 '' w), in the southern gulf of california (minimum distance between tag and recapture sites = approximately 5,000 km), after 366 days at liberty (dal). we used these empirical mark-recapture data to estimate growth rates and maximum size for tiger sharks in hawaii. we found that tiger sharks in hawaii grow twice as fast as previously thought, on average reaching 340 cm tl by age 5, and attaining a maximum size of 403 cm tl. our model indicates the fastest growing individuals attain 400 cm tl by age 5, and the largest reach a maximum size of 444 cm tl. the largest shark captured during our study was 464 cm tl but individuals >450 cm tl were extremely rare (0.005% of sharks captured). we conclude that tiger shark growth rates and maximum sizes in hawaii are generally consistent with those in other regions, and hypothesize that a broad diet may help them to achieve this rapid growth by maximizing prey consumption rates."
effects of low-level culling of feral cats in open populations: a case study from the forests of southern tasmania,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,LAZENBY BT;MOONEY NJ;DICKMAN CR,"context feral cats (felis catus) threaten biodiversity in many parts of the world, including australia. low-level culling is often used to reduce their impact, but in open cat populations the effectiveness of culling is uncertain. this is partly because options for assessing this management action have been restricted to estimating cat activity rather than abundance. aims we measured the response, including relative abundance, of feral cats to a 13-month pulse of low-level culling in two open sites in southern tasmania. methods to do this we used remote cameras and our analysis included identification of individual feral cats. we compared estimates of relative abundance obtained via capture-mark-recapture and minimum numbers known to be alive, and estimates of activity obtained using probability of detection and general index methods, pre- and post-culling. we also compared trends in cat activity and abundance over the same time period at two further sites where culling was not conducted. key results contrary to expectation, the relative abundance and activity of feral cats increased in the cull-sites, even though the numbers of cats captured per unit effort during the culling period declined. increases in minimum numbers of cats known to be alive ranged from 75% to 211% during the culling period, compared with pre- and post-cull estimates, and probably occurred due to influxes of new individuals after dominant resident cats were removed. conclusions our results showed that low-level ad hoc culling of feral cats can have unwanted and unexpected outcomes, and confirmed the importance of monitoring if such management actions are implemented. implications if culling is used to reduce cat impacts in open populations, it should be as part of a multi-faceted approach and may need to be strategic, systematic and ongoing if it is to be effective."
use by small mammals of a chronosequence of tropical rainforest revegetation,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,WHITEHEAD T;GOOSEM M;PREECE ND,"context. the conversion of tropical rainforest to grazing pasture results in a drastic change in small-mammal community composition. restoring the landscape through ecological revegetation is thus an increasingly important management technique to conserve rainforest mammals. aims. this study aimed to determine the habitat ages at which species of small mammals recolonised revegetated habitats on the southern atherton tablelands, north-eastern queensland, australia. we focussed on changes in rainforest mammal abundance and diversity with increasing habitat age. methods. small-mammal trapping and mark-recapture techniques investigated mammal diversity, abundance and community composition within remnant rainforest, three age classes of ecological revegetation and abandoned grazing pasture. key results. small-mammal community composition differed between remnant rainforest and abandoned grazing pasture. the pasture and 3-year old revegetated sites were similar in composition, both lacking rainforest small mammals. six-and 7-year old revegetation plantings provided suboptimal habitat for both rainforest and grassland mammals, whereas 16-and 22-year old revegetated habitats were dominated by rainforest species, with some individuals being frequently recaptured. conclusions. as revegetated habitats aged, the small-mammal community composition transitioned from a grassland-like composition to a community dominated by rainforest species. implications. although rainforest small mammals were very occasionally captured within the 6- and 7-year old habitats, revegetated plantings were not dominated by rainforest species until the habitat was 16 years old. this highlights the importance of commencing revegetation as early as possible to minimise future population declines and maximise the conservation of rainforest mammals."
"evaluating the accuracy and precision of multiple abundance estimators using state-space models: a case study for a threatened population of chinook salmon in johnson creek, idaho",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,CHASCO BE;WARD EJ;HESSE JA;RABE C;KINZER R;VOGEL JL;ORME R,"over the last century, chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha populations in the pacific northwest have experienced dramatic declines, leading to many of them being listed as threatened under the endangered species act. the abundance of these threatened populations relative to the thresholds for delisting remains the primary metric for assessing recovery, yet determining the true population abundances from multiple survey types with unknown levels of accuracy and precision remains difficult. the abundance of the spring-summer chinook salmon population in johnson creek, idaho, has been measured using a mark-recapture survey and three different redd count surveys (rcss) that vary temporally and spatially. using a state-space model, we determined the accuracy and precision of each survey type by decoupling the observation error of the survey from the process error describing the annual variability in the true population abundance. we then extended the results of the model to determine the risk of managers' incorrectly delisting the population (a type i error) or incorrectly keeping it listed (a type ii error). finally, we show that salmon managers with data-limited populations (primarily those with only single-pass index rcss) might use the results of our risk analysis to determine whether expanding survey efforts to minimize management risks is appropriate when they are confronted with dwindling financial resources. for example, we determined that although both the multiple-pass extended rcs (cv = 0.06) and mark-recapture surveys (cv = 0.14) provide unbiased estimates of salmon abundance in johnson creek, the mark-recapture study can have annual costs that are 30-100 times greater. managers may determine that directing research funds toward acquiring information unique to weir-based mark-recapture surveys (i.e., migration timing, good genetics samples, etc.) may not be justified for all populations."

(1) the values derived here provide some of the only estimates of local population size for these species across monsoonal northern australia; (2) population-size estimates varied considerably among seasons or sampling episodes; (3) the low apparent survival probabilities indicated that many individuals may move at scales larger than the study area; (4) density of snubfin and humpback dolphins in the present study area exceeded the few other estimates available for these species elsewhere in australia. implications. the present study provided the first baseline estimates of abundance and apparent survival for three coastal dolphin species in monsoonal northern australia. such information is becoming increasingly important as development pressures intensify in coastal areas. sampling protocols for future monitoring and impact assessment need an enhanced consideration of seasonality and scale issues."
overcoming the challenges of measuring the abundance of a cryptic macropod: is a qualitative approach good enough?,faecal pellets; indirect survey method; population size estimates; quokka; rapid survey; relative abundance; runnels; setonix brachyurus; sightings; tracks,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,BAIN K;WAYNE A;BENCINI R,"context. an understanding of population size and status is necessary for the implementation of appropriate conservation measures to recover threatened taxa. mark-recapture studies at large spatial scales are impractical and expensive and a rapid survey technique is an attractive option to provide a measure of relative abundance for cryptic species, using indicators of activity. aims. the aim of our study was to use conventional methods for population estimation to calibrate a rapid survey technique for the quokka (setonix brachyurus) in the southern forests of western australia, with a view to providing quantitative outcomes from this widely adopted monitoring approach. methods. weevaluated the accuracy of relative abundances obtained from the rapid survey technique by comparing them with abundance estimates obtained through established methods for the estimation of populations, including web-based mark-recapture and transect-based counts of activity indicators and sightings. key results. the rapid survey technique was effective at determining presence of quokkas but resulted in an overestimation of population size because of inaccurate assumptions about occupancy and relative abundance of animals. an alternative survey method based on counts of fresh faecal-pellet groups was found to provide a more reliable and practical estimation of population abundance (r-2 = 0.97). conclusions. activity indices can be used to quantify population abundance, but only for indicators of activity that can be detected readily and for which freshness of activity can be determined. implications. our findings suggest that a rapid survey based on activity indices can be used to evaluate quantitatively the population size of a species that is rare and potentially mobile at a landscape scale. the attraction of these techniques is that they provide a rapid and inexpensive survey option that is potentially applicable to any cryptic and/or threatened species and is practical for resource-constrained land managers."
better off in the wild? evaluating a captive breeding and release program for the recovery of an endangered rodent,key largo woodrat; captive breeding; release; matrix population model; population viability analysis; probability of extinction and quasi-extinction,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,MCCLEERY R;HOSTETLER JA;OLI MK,"the critical question for the success of all captive breeding and release programs (cbrps) is the same: will the benefit of augmenting or reestablishing a population with captive animals outweigh the loss of taking individuals from the wild? yet, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the impact of removal of animals for captive breeding on the source population and the potential contribution of the released animals to the augmented populations. we used the endangered key largo woodrat (neotoma floridana smalli, klwr) as a model system to simultaneously examine the effect of animal removal, captive breeding, and reintroduction on the dynamics and persistence of a wild population. we used mark-recapture and telemetry data, as well as zoo records from a recent cbrp for the endangered klwr to parameterize a matrix population model and to simulate the response of the klwr population to alternative captive breeding and release strategies. our results suggest that a cbrp as practiced previously would not contribute to klwr recovery; instead, removal of wild klwr for captive breeding could harm the population. captive breeding programs will not contribute to the recovery of klwr unless survival of released animals and breeding success of captive individuals are improved. our study provides a framework for simultaneous consideration of animal removal from the wild, breeding success in captivity and survival of released animals for a comprehensive evaluation of captive breeding programs.

barriers impede upstream spawning migration of flathead chub,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,WALTERS DM;ZUELLIG RE;CROCKETT HJ;BRUCE JF;LUKACS PM;FITZPATRICK RM,"many native cyprinids are declining throughout the north american great plains. some of these species require long reaches of contiguous, flowing riverine habitat for drifting eggs or larvae to develop, and their declining populations have been attributed to habitat fragmentation or barriers (e.g., dams, dewatered channels, and reservoirs) that restrict fish movement. upstream dispersal is also needed to maintain populations of species with passively drifting eggs or larvae, and prior researchers have suggested that these fishes migrate upstream to spawn. to test this hypothesis, we conducted a mark-recapture study of flathead chub platygobio gracilis within a 91-km reach of continuous riverine habitat in fountain creek, colorado. we measured cpue, spawning readiness (percent of flathead chub expressing milt), and fish movement relative to a channel-spanning dam. multiple lines of evidence indicate that flathead chub migrate upstream to spawn during summer. the cpue was much higher at the base of the dam than at downstream sites; the seasonal increases in cpue at the dam closely tracked seasonal increases in spawning readiness, and marked fish moved upstream as far as 33km during the spawning run. the upstream migration was effectively blocked by the dam. the cpue of flathead chub was much lower upstream of the ohdd than at downstream sites, and <0.2% of fish marked at the dam were recaptured upstream. this study provides the first direct evidence of spawning migration for flathead chub and supports the general hypothesis that barriers limit adult dispersal of these and other plains fishes. received march 12, 2013; accepted july 2, 2013"
genetic-based estimates of adult chinook salmon spawner abundance from carcass surveys and juvenile out-migrant traps,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,RAWDING DJ;SHARPE CS;BLANKENSHIP SM,"due to the challenges associated with monitoring in riverine environments, unbiased and precise spawner abundance estimates are often lacking for populations of pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp. listed under the federal endangered species act. we investigated genetic approaches to estimate the 2009 spawner abundance for a population of columbia river chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha via genetic mark-recapture and rarefaction curves. the marks were the genotyped carcasses collected from the spawning area during the first sampling event. the second sampling event consisted of a collection of juveniles from a downstream migrant trap located below the spawning area. the parents that assigned to the juveniles through parentage analysis were considered the recaptures, which was a subset of the genotypes captured in the second sample. using the petersen estimator, the genetic mark-recapture spawner abundance estimates based on the binomial and hypergeometric models were 910 and 945 chinook salmon, respectively. these results were in agreement with independently derived spawner abundance estimates based on redd counts, area-under-the-curve methods, and carcass tagging based on the jolly-seber model. using a rarefaction curve approach, which required only the juvenile offspring sample, our estimate of successful breeders was 781 fish. our genetic-based approaches provide new alternatives to estimate adult pacific salmon abundance in challenging environmental conditions or for populations with poor or unknown estimates of precision. received december 7, 2012; accepted july 17, 2013"
localized spatial and temporal variation in reproductive effort of florida bass,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,SHAW SL;ALLEN MS,"few studies have explored annual reproductive effort of fish populations, yet factors such as skipped spawning could influence recruitment processes. we estimated the number of broods produced annually as an index of reproductive effort for florida bass micropterus floridanus across four lakes in north-central florida. snorkel surveys were used to estimate reproductive effort in the lakes from 2010 to 2012. mark-recapture methods were used to estimate the abundance of florida bass in each lake during each year. all four lakes contained high-density florida bass populations that showed evidence of relatively slow growth. average relative weight in all populations was low, ranging from 65.4 to 68.8 for adults (25.0cm tl). annual reproductive effort (estimated number of broods) varied among lakes and across years. we found evidence for multiple spawning events per adult and for skipped spawning. devils hole lake produced the highest number of broods in all 3years, ranging from 1.62 broods/spawner in 2012 to 3.72 broods/spawner in 2011 (median = 3.24 broods/spawner in 2010). all other populations exhibited skipped spawning, with the proportion of nonreproductive adults varying across years. picnic lake fish had the lowest number of broods overall (only 0.02 broods/spawner in 2011 and 0.01 broods/spawner in 2012). the other two lakes showed variable levels of spawning effort. spawner abundance in these populations was not related to the estimated annual number of broods, contrary to the general assumption made for many population models. variability in annual reproductive effort may be more common than anticipated, potentially clouding the relationship between spawner abundance and recruitment. estimation of annual reproductive effort may provide insight into density-dependent population regulation and recruitment processes. received february 14, 2013; accepted july 22, 2013"

a hierarchical bayesian approach for estimating freshwater mussel growth based on tag-recapture data,hierarchical bayesian models; pit tags; freshwater mussels; growth rate; von bertalanffy,FISHERIES RESEARCH,TANG M;JIAO Y;JONES JW,"in fisheries stock assessment and management, the von bertalanffy growth model is commonly used to describe individual growth of many species by fitting age-at-length data. however, it is difficult or impossible to determine accurate individual ages in some cases. mark-recapture survey becomes an alternative choice to collect individual growth information. in mark-recapture studies, some tagged animals can be recaptured more than one time and ignorance of the autocorrelations for each individual may result in substantial biases in estimations of growth parameters. to investigate the existence of individual and sex variability in growth, we designed an experiment to collect mark-recapture data for one endangered freshwater mussel species (epioblasma capsaeformis) and one common, non-imperiled species (actinonaias pectorosa) by using a passive integrated transponder (pit) technique. models with individual and sex variability (m1), sex-related differences (m2), individual variability (m3) and nonhierarchy (m4) were developed to estimate growth of e. capsaeformis and a. pectorosa. deviance information criterion (dic) was used to measure the performance of these models. for e. capsaefonnis, female mussels tended to have higher means of asymptotic length (44.96 mm) and growth rate coefficient (0.283/year) than males (42.18 mm and 0.213/year). the model m3 yielded the lowest dic value for both species, indicating individual differences should be considered in parameter estimation. thus, we suggest that a hierarchical approach be used to consider individual variability for modeling growth of mussels with mark-recapture data, especially when there is a high percentage of multiple recaptures.

the effect of research activities and winter precipitation on voiding behaviour of agassiz's desert tortoises (gopherus agassizii),conservation; research manipulation; sonoran desert; survival; wildlife handling,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,AGHA M;MURPHY MO;LOVICH JE;ENNEN JR;OLDHAM CR;MEYER K;BJURLIN C;AUSTIN M;MADRAK S;LOUGHRAN C;TENNANT L;PRICE SJ,"context. there is little information available on how research activities might cause stress responses in wildlife, especially responses of threatened species such as the desert tortoise (gopherus agassizii). aims. the present study aims to detect behavioural effects of researcher handling and winter precipitation on a natural population of desert tortoises in the desert of southwestern united states, over the period 1997 to 2014, through extensive assessments of capture events during multiple research studies, and capture-mark-recapture survivorship analysis. methods. juvenile and adult desert tortoises were repeatedly handled with consistent methodology across 18 years during 10 study seasons. using a generalised linear mixed-effects model, we assessed the effects of both research manipulation and abiotic conditions on probability of voiding. additionally, we used a cormack-jolly-seber model to assess the effects of winter precipitation and voiding on long-term apparent survivorship. key results. of 1008 total capture events, voiding was recorded on 83 (8.2%) occasions in 42 different individuals. our top models indicated that increases in handling time led to significantly higher probabilities of voiding for juveniles, females and males. similarly, increases in precipitation resulted in significantly higher probabilities of voiding for juveniles and females, but not for males. tortoise capture frequency was negatively correlated with voiding occurrence. cormack-jolly-seber models demonstrated a weak effect of winter precipitation on survivorship, but a negligible effect for both voiding behaviour and sex. conclusions. handling-induced voiding by desert tortoises may occur during common research activities and years of above average winter precipitation. increased likelihood of voiding in individuals with relatively low numbers of recaptures suggested that tortoises may have perceived researchers initially as predators, and therefore voided as a defensive strategy. voiding does not appear to impact long-term survivorship in desert tortoises at this site. implications. this study has demonstrated that common handling practices on desert tortoise may cause voiding behaviour. these results suggest that in order to minimise undesirable behavioural responses in studied desert tortoise populations, defined procedures or protocols must be followed by the investigators to reduce contact period to the extent feasible."
bayes and empirical bayes estimators of abundance and density from spatial capture-recapture data,NA,PLOS ONE,DORAZIO RM,"in capture-recapture and mark-resight surveys, movements of individuals both within and between sampling periods can alter the susceptibility of individuals to detection over the region of sampling. in these circumstances spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) models, which incorporate the observed locations of individuals, allow population density and abundance to be estimated while accounting for differences in detectability of individuals. in this paper i propose two bayesian secr models, one for the analysis of recaptures observed in trapping arrays and another for the analysis of recaptures observed in area searches. in formulating these models i used distinct submodels to specify the distribution of individual home-range centers and the observable recaptures associated with these individuals. this separation of ecological and observational processes allowed me to derive a formal connection between bayes and empirical bayes estimators of population abundance that has not been established previously. i showed that this connection applies to every poisson point-process model of secr data and provides theoretical support for a previously proposed estimator of abundance based on recaptures in trapping arrays. to illustrate results of both classical and bayesian methods of analysis, i compared bayes and empirical bayes esimates of abundance and density using recaptures from simulated and real populations of animals. real populations included two iconic datasets: recaptures of tigers detected in camera-trap surveys and recaptures of lizards detected in area-search surveys. in the datasets i analyzed, classical and bayesian methods provided similar - and often identical - inferences, which is not surprising given the sample sizes and the noninformative priors used in the analyses."
environmental instability as a motor for dispersal: a case study from a growing population of glossy ibis,NA,PLOS ONE,SANTORO S;GREEN AJ;FIGUEROLA J,"dispersal is a life-history trait directly affecting population dynamics and species range shifts and thus playing a prominent role in the response to climate change. nonetheless, the relationship between extreme climatic events and dispersal has received little attention in birds. here we focused on climatic, demographic and individual factors affecting the dispersal propensity of a major glossy ibis population. we performed a capture-resighting analysis on individuals born and observed at donana (south-west spain) over fourteen years. we applied a multiple analytical approach to show that single-site capture-resighting estimates were a reliable index of dispersal propensity from the area. we focused on the emigration of donana-born individuals sporadically (transients) and regularly (residents) frequenting their natal area. droughts during two out of 14 study years caused higher apparent dispersal rates, explaining most of the annual variation in these rates. the age structure of donana-born individuals resighted simultaneously locally and in morocco in one week over the 2010 autumn confirmed that the 2005 drought boosted permanent emigration. as numbers increased steadily during non-drought years since the formation of the colony in 1996 to several thousand pairs, philopatry increased gradually, while transients probability appeared to be related to average breeding success. age, sex, density, quality of foraging habitat and breeding success in the previous season were not found to directly affect apparent dispersal. nonetheless, autumn sex ratio gradually switched from male (approximate to 0.68) to female-skewed (approximate to 0.44) by the end of the study period, suggesting that males and females respond differently to high densities reached in recent years. this study demonstrates the importance of extreme climatic events as a powerful motor for spread of species in expansion. also, it suggests different factors drive emigration of individuals according to their amount of experience in the area (e.g. transients vs residents)."
evidence of a high density population of harvested leopards in a montane environment,NA,PLOS ONE,GREY JNC;KENT VT;HILL RA,"populations of large carnivores can persist in mountainous environments following extensive land use change and the conversion of suitable habitat for agriculture and human habitation in lower lying areas of their range. the significance of these populations is poorly understood, however, and little attention has focussed on why certain mountainous areas can hold high densities of large carnivores and what the conservation implications of such populations might be. here we use the leopard (panthera pardus) population in the western soutpansberg mountains, south africa, as a model system and show that montane habitats can support high numbers of leopards. spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) analysis recorded the highest density of leopards reported outside of state-protected areas in sub-saharan africa. this density represents a temporally high local abundance of leopards and we explore the explanations for this alongside some of the potential conservation implications."
apparent survival rates of forest birds in eastern ecuador revisited: improvement in precision but no change in estimates,NA,PLOS ONE,BLAKE JG;LOISELLE BA,"knowledge of survival rates of neotropical landbirds remains limited, with estimates of apparent survival available from relatively few sites and species. previously, capture-mark-recapture models were used to estimate apparent survival of 31 species (30 passerines, 1 trochilidae) from eastern ecuador based on data collected from 2001 to 2006. here, estimates are updated with data from 2001-2012 to determine how additional years of data affect estimates; estimates for six additional species are provided. models assuming constant survival had highest support for 19 of 31 species when based on 12 years of data compared to 27 when based on six; models incorporating effects of transients had the highest support for 12 of 31 species compared to four when based on 12 and six years, respectively. average apparent survival based on the most highly-supported model (based on model averaging, when appropriate) was 0.59 (+/- 0.02 se) across 30 species of passerines when based on 12 years and 0.57 (+/- 0.02) when based on six. standard errors of survival estimates based on 12 years were approximately half those based on six years. of 31 species in both data sets, estimates of apparent survival were somewhat lower for 13, somewhat higher for 17, and remained unchanged for one; confidence intervals for estimates based on six and 12 years of data overlapped for all species. results indicate that estimates of apparent survival are comparable but more precise when based on longer-term data sets; standard error of the estimates was negatively correlated with numbers of captures (r(s) = -0.72) and recaptures (r(s) = -0.93, p<0.001 in both cases). thus, reasonable estimates of apparent survival may be obtained with relatively few years of data if sample sizes are sufficient."
markov models for community dynamics allowing for observation error,bayesian inference; community dynamics; markov model; multistate dynamic occupancy model; sampling error; sessile organisms; state-space model; transition probability,ECOLOGY,FUKAYA K;ROYLE JA,"markov models are dynamic models that characterize transitions among discrete ecological states with transition probability matrices. such models are widely used to infer community dynamics of sessile organisms because transition probabilities (the elements of transition probability matrices) can be estimated with time series data from grid sampling, where species occupancy states are assessed at multiple fixed points in a quadrat or transect. these estimates, however, are known to be biased when resampling error exists. in this study, we used the perspective of multistate dynamic occupancy models to develop a new markov model that is structured hierarchically such that transitions among occupancy states and observation processes are considered explicitly at each fixed point. we show that, by adopting a hierarchical bayesian approach, our model provides estimates for transition probabilities that are robust to sampling error. we also show that error rate may be estimated without additional data obtained from rapid repeated sampling. considerations for the analysis for the application to real data set and potential extensions of the proposed model are discussed."
integrating batch marks and radio tags to estimate the size of a closed population with a movement model,batch-marking; capture-recapture; movement,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,SCHWARZ CJ;COPE S;FRATTON G,"movement models require individually identifiable marks to estimate the movement rates among strata. but they are relatively expensive to apply and monitor. batch marks can be readily applied, but individual animal movements cannot be identified. we describe a method to estimate population size in a stratified population when movement takes place among strata and animals are marked with a combination of batch and individually identifiable tags. a hierarchical model with bayesian inference is developed that pools information across segments on the detection efficiency based on radio-tagged fish and also uses the movement of the radio-tagged fish to impute the movement of the batch-marked fish to provide estimates of the population size on a segment and river level. the batch marks provide important information to help estimate the movement rates, but contribute little to the overall estimate of the population size. in this case, the approximate equal catchability among strata in either sample obviates the need for stratification."
correcting length-frequency distributions for imperfect detection,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,BRETON AR;HAWKINS JA;WINKELMAN DL,"sampling gear selects for specific sizes of fish, which may bias length-frequency distributions that are commonly used to assess population size structure, recruitment patterns, growth, and survival. to properly correct for sampling biases caused by gear and other sources, length-frequency distributions need to be corrected for imperfect detection. we describe a method for adjusting length-frequency distributions when capture and recapture probabilities are a function of fish length, temporal variation, and capture history. the method is applied to a study involving the removal of smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu by boat electrofishing from a 38.6-km reach on the yampa river, colorado. smallmouth bass longer than 100mm were marked and released alive from 2005 to 2010 on one or more electrofishing passes and removed on all other passes from the population. using the huggins mark-recapture model, we detected a significant effect of fish total length, previous capture history (behavior), year, pass, yearxbehavior, and yearxpass on capture and recapture probabilities. we demonstrate how to partition the huggins estimate of abundance into length frequencies to correct for these effects. uncorrected length frequencies of fish removed from little yampa canyon were negatively biased in every year by as much as 88% relative to mark-recapture estimates for the smallest length-class in our analysis (100-110mm). bias declined but remained high even for adult length-classes (200mm). the pattern of bias across length-classes was variable across years. the percentage of unadjusted counts that were below the lower 95% confidence interval from our adjusted length-frequency estimates were 95, 89, 84, 78, 81, and 92% from 2005 to 2010, respectively. length-frequency distributions are widely used in fisheries science and management. our simple method for correcting length-frequency estimates for imperfect detection could be widely applied when mark-recapture data are available."
females better face senescence in the wandering albatross,breeding success; breeding probability; capture-mark-recapture; diomedea exulans; seabird; senescence; sexual dimorphism; survival,OECOLOGIA,PARDO D;BARBRAUD C;WEIMERSKIRCH H,"sex differences in lifespan and aging are widespread among animals. since investment in current reproduction can have consequences on other life-history traits, the sex with the highest cost of breeding is expected to suffer from an earlier and/or stronger senescence. this has been demonstrated in polygynous species that are highly dimorphic. however in monogamous species where parental investment is similar between sexes, sex-specific differences in aging patterns of life-history traits are expected to be attenuated. here, we examined sex and age influences on demographic traits in a very long-lived and sexually dimorphic monogamous species, the wandering albatross (diomedea exulans). we modelled within the same model framework sex-dependent variations in aging for an array of five life-history traits: adult survival, probability of returning to the breeding colony, probability of breeding and two measures of breeding success (hatching and fledging). we show that life-history traits presented contrasted aging patterns according to sex whereas traits were all similar at young ages. both sexes exhibited actuarial and reproductive senescence, but, as the decrease in breeding success remained similar for males and females, the survival and breeding probabilities of males were significantly more affected than females. we discuss our results in the light of the costs associated to reproduction, age-related pairing and a biased operational sex-ratio in the population leading to a pool of non-breeders of potentially lower quality and therefore more subject to death or breeding abstention. for a monogamous species with similar parental roles, the patterns observed were surprising and when placed in a gradient of observed age/sex-related variations in life-history traits, wandering albatrosses were intermediate between highly dimorphic polygynous and most monogamous species."
assessment of the fishing impact on the silver eel stock in the baltic using survival analysis,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,DEKKER W;SJOBERG NB,"restoration of the depleted stock of the european eel (anguilla anguilla (l.)) requires anthropogenic impacts to be quantified, reduced, and controlled. in this article, we assess the impact of the silver eel fishery on the baltic coast in sweden, applying survival analysis to 60 years of mark-recapture experiments, involving 8000 recaptures out of 18 000 releases. the hazard of being recaptured (overall 46%) varies along the coast and declined substantially over the decades. but, most notably, the hazard for the individual diminishes strongly after the first kilometres en route. this individualized hazard disqualifies the more traditional mark-recapture methodology, which assumes random recaptures. we advocate the general use of survival analysis for conventional mark-recapture data. the result of our analysis indicates that the impact of the fishery just prior the 2009 fishing restrictions was in the order of 10%-in itself well within sustainability limits, though only but one of the factors contributing to the mortality in the baltic sea."

rapid assessment of rat eradication after aerial baiting,detection; invasive rodents; island restoration; modelling; pest management; rattus rattus; surveillance; tropical islands,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,SAMANIEGO HERRERA A;ANDERSON DP;PARKES JP;AGUIRRE MUNOZ A,"eradication of introduced rodents on islands is increasingly implemented as a conservation tool. aerial baiting, currently the main eradication technique, provides no information on whether eradication has been achieved. success is usually evaluated after a standard period of 2years with no sign of rodents. we describe a novel approach to assess the success of eradication efforts based on a project to eradicate ship rats rattus rattus from isabel island (82ha), mexico. we used detection and home-range parameters obtained from a capture-recapture study completed prior to aerial baiting to build a spatial-survey model that predicts probability of eradication after the treatment. the spatial-survey model estimated a >99% probability of success after two surveys with no rats detected. this approach can be used to make eradication projects more cost-effective. survivors, if any, could be located and dispatched by localized control methods. this avoids repeat aerial baiting of the whole island if failure becomes apparent. this model is a useful tool for (a) assessing the probability of eradication within weeks, rather than years of an operation, and (b) predicting the required survey effort to achieve a probability of success consistent with the costs and risks of falsely declaring eradication success. synthesis and applications: rapid assessment of success after rodent eradication efforts on islands results in financial savings by potentially reducing the duration of the projects. improvements in biosecurity guidelines might also accrue as delays in detecting rats after an operation may confound their identification as offspring of survivors or re-invaders. advanced techniques and predictive modelling will increase confidence among partners and donors and allow more efficient achievement of regional programmes."
impact of farmland use on population density and activity patterns of serval in south africa,camera trap; capture recapture models; conservation; land use; leptailurus serval; south africa,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,RAMESH T;DOWNS CT,"the drakensberg midlands, south africa are experiencing unprecedented levels of habitat change. despite the serval (leptailurus serval) being a near-threatened wetland specialist, no studies have investigated their response to land use. to assess their abundance, we used camera trapping at 3 sites differing in intensity of farmland use with capture recapture models. a total of 1,320 camera trap nights across the 3 sites yielded 26 and 28 servals. we detected no major difference in servals/100 km(2) among the 3 sites using spatially explicit maximum-likelihood (7.6 +/- 2.3; 6.5 +/- 2.7; 6.5 +/- 2.6) and bayesian (7.7 +/- 1.6; 6.2 +/- 1.9; 6.9 +/- 2.1) methods in sites a, b, and c, respectively. servals were mainly crepuscular and nocturnal. the mardia-watson-wheeler test showed significant difference in activity in a and c compared with b, whereas it showed no difference between a and c. servals avoided activity during the day in the intensively farmed b. abundance analysis at the broader habitat scale may not have detected variation among sites. differences need to be tested at smaller spatial scales. the statistical approaches in this study provide the 1st robust estimation of serval population size. this estimation of a medium-sized felid with changing land use can assist their management and conservation."
evidence for an association between post-fledging dispersal and microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity in a large population of greater flamingos,NA,PLOS ONE,GILLINGHAM MAF;CEZILLY F;WATTIER R;BECHET A,"dispersal can be divided into three stages: departure, transience and settlement. despite the fact that theoretical studies have emphasized the importance of heterozygosity on dispersal strategies, empirical evidence of its effect on different stages of dispersal is lacking. here, using multi-event capture-mark-recapture models, we show a negative association between microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity (mlh; 10 loci; n = 1023) and post-fledging dispersal propensity for greater flamingos, phoenicopterus roseus, born in southern france. we propose that the negative effects of inbreeding depression affects competitive ability and therefore more homozygous individuals are more likely to disperse because they are less able to compete within the highly saturated natal site. finally, a model with the effect of mlh on propensity of post-fledgling dispersers to disperse to the long-distance sites of africa was equivalent to the null model, suggesting that mlh had low to no effect on dispersal distance. variations in individual genetic quality thus result in context-dependent heterogeneity in dispersal strategies at each stage of dispersal. our results have important implications on fitness since sites visited early in life are known to influence site selection later on in life and future survival."
innate immunity correlates with host fitness in wild boar (sus scrofa) exposed to classical swine fever,NA,PLOS ONE,ROSSI S;DOUCELIN A;LE POTIER MF;ERAUD C;GILOT FROMONT E,"constitutive humoral immunity (chi) is thought to be a first-line of protection against pathogens invading vertebrate hosts. however, clear evidence that chi correlates with host fitness in natural conditions is still lacking. this study explores the relationship between chi, measured using a haemagglutination-haemolysis assay (hahl), and resistance to classical swine fever virus (csfv) among wild boar piglets. the individual dynamics of hahl during piglet growth was analysed, using 423 serum samples from 92 piglets repeatedly captured in the absence of csfv (in 2006) within two areas showing contrasting food availability. natural antibody levels increased with age, but, in the youngest piglets antibody levels were higher in individuals from areas with the highest food availability. complement activity depended on natural antibody levels and piglets' body condition. in the presence of csfv (i.e., in 2005 within one area), serum samples from piglets that were repeatedly captured were used to assess whether piglet hahl levels affected csfv status at a later capture. the correlation between chi and resistance to csfv was tested using 79 hahl measures from 23 piglets captured during a csfv outbreak. both natural antibodies and complement activity levels measured at a given time correlated negatively to the subsequent probability of becoming viremic. finally, capture-mark-recapture models showed that piglets with medium/high average complement activity, independently of their age, were significantly less at risk of becoming viremic and more likely to develop a specific immune response than piglets with low complement activity. additionally, piglets with high average complement activity showed the highest survival prospects. this study provides evidence linking chi to individual fitness within a natural mammal population. the results also highlight the potential of hahl assays to explore the dynamics and co-evolution between wildlife mammal hosts and blood-borne parasites interacting with the chi."

known unknowns in an imperfect world: incorporating uncertainty in recruitment estimates using multi-event capture-recapture models,breeding state assignment; multistate capture-recapture models; primiparity; southern elephant seals; state uncertainty; vital rates,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,DESPREZ M;MCMAHON CR;HINDELL MA;HARCOURT R;GIMENEZ O,"studying the demography of wild animals remains challenging as several of the critical parts of their life history may be difficult to observe in the field. in particular, determining with certainty when an individual breeds for the first time is not always obvious. this can be problematic because uncertainty about the transition from a prebreeder to a breeder state - recruitment - leads to uncertainty in vital rate estimates and in turn in population projection models. to avoid this issue, the common practice is to discard imperfect data from the analyses. however, this practice can generate a bias in vital rate estimates if uncertainty is related to a specific component of the population and reduces the sample size of the dataset and consequently the statistical power to detect effects of biological interest. here, we compared the demographic parameters assessed from a standard multistate capture-recapture approach to the estimates obtained from the newly developed multi-event framework that specifically accounts for uncertainty in state assessment. using a comprehensive longitudinal dataset on southern elephant seals, we demonstrated that the multi-event model enabled us to use all the data collected (6639 capture-recapture histories vs. 4179 with the multistate model) by accounting for uncertainty in breeding states, thereby increasing the precision and accuracy of the demographic parameter estimates. the multi-event model allowed us to incorporate imperfect data into demographic analyses. the gain in precision obtained has important implications in the conservation and management of species because limiting uncertainty around vital rates will permit predicting population viability with greater accuracy."
a multievent approach to estimating pair fidelity and heterogeneity in state transitions,great tit; heterogeneous recapture rates; multievent mark-recapture modeling; survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CULINA A;LACHISH S;PRADEL R;CHOQUET R;SHELDON BC,"fidelity rates of pair-bonded individuals are of considerable interest to behavioral and population biologists as they can influence population structure, mating rates, population productivity, and gene flow. estimates of fidelity rates calculated from direct observations of pairs in consecutive breeding seasons may be biased because (i) individuals that are not seen are assumed to be dead, (ii) variation in the detectability of individuals is ignored, and (iii) pair status must be known with certainty. this can lead to a high proportion of observations being ignored. this approach also restricts the way variation in fidelity rates for different types of individuals, or the covariation between fidelity and other vital rates (e.g., survival) can be analyzed. in this study, we develop a probabilistic multievent capture-mark-recapture (mecmr) modeling framework for estimating pair fidelity rates that accounts for imperfect detection rates and capture heterogeneity, explicitly incorporates uncertainty in the assessment of pair status, and allows estimates of state-dependent survival and fidelity rates to be obtained simultaneously. we demonstrate the utility of our approach for investigating patterns of fidelity in pair-bonded individuals, by applying it to 30years of breeding data from a wild population of great tits parus major linnaeus. results of model selection supported state-dependent recapture, survival, and fidelity rates. recapture rates were higher for individuals breeding with their previous partner than for those breeding with a different partner. faithful birds that were breeding with the same partner as in the previous breeding season (i.e., at t-1) experienced substantially higher survival rates (between t and t+1) and were also more likely to remain faithful to their current partner (i.e., to remain in the faithful state at t+1). first year breeders were more likely to change partner than older birds. these findings imply that traditional estimates, which do not account for state-dependent parameters, may be both inaccurate and biased, and hence, inferences based on them may conceal important biological effects. this was demonstrated in the analysis of simulated capture histories, which showed that our mecmr model was able to estimate state-dependant survival and pair fidelity rates in the face of varying state-dependant recapture rates robustly, and more accurately, than the traditional method. in addition, this new modeling approach provides a statistically rigorous framework for testing hypothesis about the causes and consequences of fidelity to a partner for natural populations. the novel modeling approach described here can readily be applied, either in its current form or via extension, to other populations and other types of dyadic interactions (e.g., between nonpaired individuals, such as parent-offspring relationships, or between individuals and locations, such as nest-site fidelity)."
accommodating species identification errors in transect surveys,abundance estimation; animal density; complete data; distance sampling; latent state model; partial state observation; quadrat sampling; species misclassification; species misidentification,ECOLOGY,CONN PB;MCCLINTOCK BT;CAMERON MF;JOHNSON DS;MORELAND EE;BOVENG PL,"ecologists often use transect surveys to estimate the density and abundance of animal populations. errors in species classification are often evident in such surveys, yet few statistical methods exist to properly account for them. in this paper, we examine biases that result from species misidentification when ignored, and we develop statistical models to provide unbiased estimates of density in the face of such errors. our approach treats true species identity as a latent variable and requires auxiliary information on the misclassification process (such as informative priors, experiments using known species, or a double-observer protocol). we illustrate our approach with simulated census data and with double-observer survey data for ice-associated seals in the bering sea. for the seal analysis, we integrated misclassification into a model-based framework for distance-sampling data. the simulated data analysis demonstrated reliable estimation of animal density when there are experimental data to inform misclassification rates; double-observer protocols provided robust inference when there were unknown species observations but no outright misclassification, or when misclassification probabilities were symmetric and a symmetry constraint was imposed during estimation. under our modeling framework, we obtained reasonable apparent densities of seal species even under considerable imprecision in species identification. we obtained more reliable inferences when modeling variation in density among transects. we argue that ecologists should often use spatially explicit models to account for differences in species distributions when trying to account for species misidentification. our results support using double-observer sampling protocols that guard against species misclassification (i.e., by recording uncertain observations as unknown)."
evaluating river otter demography using noninvasive genetic methods,abundance estimate; citizen science; humboldt bay; lontra canadensis; mark-recapture; noninvasive sampling; river otter,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BRZESKI KE;GUNTHER MS;BLACK JM,"the decline in river otter (lontra canadensis) populations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries throughout north america has led to protective status and strict harvest regulations. despite sustained interest in protecting river otters, relatively few contemporary studies have evaluated the current status of populations, especially in california. an effective way to estimate river otter population sizes and facilitate monitoring is with noninvasive genetic methods. our objective was to establish baseline demographic information for an understudied river otter population in northern california by estimating river otter abundance using noninvasive genetic sampling, supplemented with data obtained from an observation-based citizen science project focusing on river otters. we extracted dna from scat and genotyped samples at 6 microsatellite loci. we used program mark to build mark-recapture models to estimate river otter abundance and pooled visual observations from a citizen science project maintained in humboldt county, california to supplement population estimates with information regarding pups and group size. between 41 and 44 river otters were in the study area based on noninvasive genetic samples, and group sizes ranged 1-7 or 2-12 based on observational and genetic data, respectively. the humboldt bay region had a high density of river otters (0.93otters/km) as compared to other coastal systems; resource attributes of humboldt bay could contribute to this difference. results reported herein demonstrate methods appropriate for establishing baseline river otter demographics.

contrasting patterns of survival and dispersal in multiple habitats reveal an ecological trap in a food-caching bird,gray jays; highways; multistate capture-recapture; perisoreus canadensis; seasonality,OECOLOGIA,NORRIS DR;FLOCKHART DTT;STRICKLAND D,"a comprehensive understanding of how natural and anthropogenic variation in habitat influences populations requires long-term information on how such variation affects survival and dispersal throughout the annual cycle. gray jays perisoreus canadensis are widespread boreal resident passerines that use cached food to survive over the winter and to begin breeding during the late winter. using multistate capture-recapture analysis, we examined apparent survival and dispersal in relation to habitat quality in a gray jay population over 34 years (1977-2010). prior evidence suggests that natural variation in habitat quality is driven by the proportion of conifers on territories because of their superior ability to preserve cached food. although neither adults (> 1 year) nor juveniles (< 1 year) had higher survival rates on high-conifer territories, both age classes were less likely to leave high-conifer territories and, when they did move, were more likely to disperse to high-conifer territories. in contrast, survival rates were lower on territories that were adjacent to a major highway compared to territories that did not border the highway but there was no evidence for directional dispersal towards or away from highway territories. our results support the notion that natural variation in habitat quality is driven by the proportion of coniferous trees on territories and provide the first evidence that high-mortality highway habitats can act as an equal-preference ecological trap for birds. reproductive success, as shown in a previous study, but not survival, is sensitive to natural variation in habitat quality, suggesting that gray jays, despite living in harsh winter conditions, likely favor the allocation of limited resources towards self-maintenance over reproduction."
use of the robust design to estimate seasonal abundance and demographic parameters of a coastal bottlenose dolphin (tursiops aduncus) population,NA,PLOS ONE,SMITH HC;POLLOCK K;WAPLES K;BRADLEY S;BEJDER L,"as delphinid populations become increasingly exposed to human activities we rely on our capacity to produce accurate abundance estimates upon which to base management decisions. this study applied mark-recapture methods following the robust design to estimate abundance, demographic parameters, and temporary emigration rates of an indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin (tursiops aduncus) population off bunbury, western australia. boat-based photo-identification surveys were conducted year-round over three consecutive years along pre-determined transect lines to create a consistent sampling effort throughout the study period and area. the best fitting capture-recapture model showed a population with a seasonal markovian temporary emigration with time varying survival and capture probabilities. abundance estimates were seasonally dependent with consistently lower numbers obtained during winter and higher during summer and autumn across the three-year study period. specifically, abundance estimates for all adults and juveniles (combined) varied from a low of 63 (95% ci 59 to 73) in winter of 2007 to a high of 139 (95% ci 134 to148) in autumn of 2009. temporary emigration rates (gamma') for animals absent in the previous period ranged from 0.34 to 0.97 (mean = 0.54; +/- se 0.11) with a peak during spring. temporary emigration rates for animals present during the previous period (gamma '') were lower, ranging from 0.00 to 0.29, with a mean of 0.16 (+/- se 0.04). this model yielded a mean apparent survival estimate for juveniles and adults (combined) of 0.95 (+/- se 0.02) and a capture probability from 0.07 to 0.51 with a mean of 0.30 (+/- se 0.04). this study demonstrates the importance of incorporating temporary emigration to accurately estimate abundance of coastal delphinids. temporary emigration rates were high in this study, despite the large area surveyed, indicating the challenges of sampling highly mobile animals which range over large spatial areas."
impacts of anchor tag loss on walleye management in the winnebago system,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,KOENIGS RP;BRUCH RM;KAMKE KK,"rates of tag loss should be estimated and accounted for when using mark-recapture surveys and angler tag returns to estimate fish population abundance and exploitation rates. walleyes sander vitreus sampled during april 2010 spawning assessments conducted in the winnebago system, wisconsin, were marked with anchor tags and upper caudal fin clips to estimate tag loss rates during three time intervals: 0-11 d posttagging, 0-90 d posttagging, and 1 year posttagging. tag loss was negligible (<0.5%) within the first 11 d but increased to 4.7% within the first 90 d and to 21.9% after 1 year. after we corrected for the tag loss occurring within the first 90 d, estimates of population abundance decreased 4.3% for females and 4.4% for males, while estimates of exploitation increased 4.9% for both sexes. accounting for 21.9% annual tag loss led to more severe decreases in the estimates of population abundance (20.0% for females and 21.2% for males) and increases in the estimates of exploitation (28.0% for both sexes) than not accounting for any tag loss. higher exploitation rates resulted in higher estimates of fishing mortality and lower estimates of natural mortality. when used in yield-per-recruit models, the estimated natural mortality rates derived from exploitation rates that accounted for tag loss resulted in higher yields through the implementation of larger minimum length limits to maximize yield. we recommend that managers evaluate the effectiveness of their tagging operations by estimating tag loss and assessing the potential impacts of quantified loss on management metrics. we also caution against the application of population models without an accurate estimate of tag loss and the associated impacts on estimates of population abundance and exploitation and, in turn, fishing and natural mortality rates. received may 22, 2013; accepted june 11, 2013"
detecting noncompliance in the summer flounder recreational fishery using a mark-recapture growth model,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HENDERSON MJ;FABRIZIO MC,"we used a mark-recapture growth model to investigate recreational angler compliance with minimum length regulations in a popular chesapeake bay fishery. angler noncompliance can severely degrade the ability of fishery managers to avoid overexploitation and to achieve objectives of rebuilding plans. to discern noncompliance in the recreational fishery for summer flounder paralichthys dentatus, we fitted a growth model to 3,474 recapture records from a tagging study conducted by volunteer anglers in virginia from 2000 to 2011. most of the tagged fish were small (i.e., sublegal size), and the average time at liberty was 86 d. based on the growth model, summer flounder growth patterns changed at 34.7cm, possibly representing the length at which the majority of fish reach maturity. the mean size of harvested fish increased in response to increases in the minimum size limit, although harvest of sublegal fish continued. throughout the 12years of the study, 33-79% of the tagged fish that were recaptured and harvested were predicted to be sublegal based on the growth model. the percentage of sublegal fish that were harvested increased dramatically when large (5cm) increases in minimum size limits were implemented. we conclude that virginia recreational anglers responded to management regulations by adjusting the minimum size of harvested fish but that some anglers continued to harvest sublegal fish. received april 9, 2013; accepted june 18, 2013"
individual heterogeneity in black brant survival and recruitment with implications for harvest dynamics,adaptive management; frailty; growth rate; harvest; waterfowl,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,LINDBERG MS;SEDINGER JS;LEBRETON JD,"we examined individual heterogeneity in survival and recruitment of female pacific black brant (branta bernicla nigricans) using frailty models adapted to a capture-mark-recapture context. our main objectives were (1) to quantify levels of heterogeneity and examine factors affecting heterogeneity, and (2) model the effects of individual heterogeneity on harvest dynamics through matrix models. we used 24years of data on brant marked and recaptured at the tutakoke river colony, ak. multievent models were fit as hidden markov chain using program e-surge with an adequate overdispersion coefficient. annual survival of individuals marked as goslings was heterogeneous among individuals and year specific with about 0.23 difference in survival between high (0.73)- and low (0.50)-quality individuals at average survival probability. adult survival (0.85 +/- 0.004) was homogeneous and higher than survival of both groups of juveniles. the annual recruitment probability was heterogeneous for brant >1-year-old; 0.56 (+/- 0.21) and 0.31 (+/- 0.03) for high- and low-quality individuals, respectively. assuming equal clutch sizes for high- and low-quality individuals and that 80% of offspring were in the same quality class as the breeding female resulted in reproductive values about twice as high for high-quality individuals than low-quality individual for a given class of individuals producing differential contributions to population growth among groups. differences in reproductive values greatly increased when we assumed high-quality individuals had larger clutch sizes. when we assumed that 50% of offspring were in the same quality class as their mothers and clutches were equal, differences in reproductive values between quality classes were greatly reduced or eliminated (breeders [brs]). we considered several harvest scenarios using the assumption that 80% of offspring were in the same quality class as their mothers. the amount of compensation for harvest mortality declined as the proportion of high-quality individuals in the harvest increased, as differences in clutch sizes between groups decreased and as the proportion of brs in the harvest increased. synthesis and applications. harvest at the same proportional level of the overall population can result in variable responses in population growth rate when heterogeneity is present in a population. was <1.0 under every scenario when harvest rates were >10%, and heterogeneity caused as much as +2% difference in growth rates at the highest levels of proportional harvest for low-quality individuals and the greatest differences in qualities between classes of individuals, a critical difference for a population with near 1.0 such as the brant. we observed less response in overall survival in the presence of heterogeneity because we did not observe heterogeneity in the annual survival of brs. this analysis provides a comprehensive view of overall compensation at the population level and also constitutes the first example of a survival-recruitment model with heterogeneity. individual heterogeneity should be more explicitly considered in harvest management of vertebrates."
estimating transitions between states using measurements with imperfect detection: application to serological data,black-legged kittiwake; borrelia burdgorferi; continuous measurement; eco-epidemiology; hidden markov model; immunological assay; mixture; rissa tridactyla; stable-isotope ratio,ECOLOGY,CHOQUET R;CARRIE C;CHAMBERT T;BOULINIER T,"classifying the states of an individual and quantifying transitions between states are crucial while modeling animal behavior, movement, and physiologic status. when these states are hidden or imperfectly known, it is particularly convenient to relate them to appropriate quantitative measurements taken on the individual. this task is, however, challenging when quantitative measurements are not available at each sampling occasion. for capture-recapture data, various ways of incorporating such non-discrete information have been used, but they are either ad hoc and/or use a fraction of the available information by relying on a priori thresholds to assign individual states. here we propose assigning discrete states based on a continuous measurement, and then modeled survival and transition probabilities based on these assignments. the main advantage of this new approach is that a more informative use of the non-discrete information is done. as an illustrative working example, we applied this approach to eco-epidemiological data collected across a series of years in which individuals of a long-lived seabird, the black-legged kittiwake (rissa tridactyla), could either be visually detected or physically recaptured and blood sampled for subsequent immunological analyses. we discuss how this approach opens many perspectives in eco-epidemiology, but also more broadly, in population ecology."
a cautionary note on the discrete uniform prior for the binomial n,abundance; bayesian analysis; binomial; data augmentation; n estimation; priors,ECOLOGY,LINK WA,"analysis of wildlife data frequently involves estimation of population size n based on binomial counts. bayesian analysts often use a constant prior for n, the choice motivated by a desire to avoid an informative prior, and to let the data speak for themselves. for instance, data augmentation methods for model m-h posit a super-population of size m >> n with individual detection probabilities z(i)p(i), with p(i) sampled from a parametric family of interest, and z(i) an indicator of membership in the target population; thus, n = sigma(i)z(i). treating z(i) as independent bernoulli trials with success rate and assigning a uniform prior to is equivalent to assigning a discrete uniform prior for n on {0,1,2, ... , m}; by setting m large enough, analysts approximate the improper constant prior on the positive integers. in this paper, i demonstrate some paradoxical and plainly unacceptable features of the constant prior. these defects are not shared by the scale prior, which has been recommended for its good performance as measured by frequentist criteria. i show how the scale prior can be approximated in program openbugs, including data augmentation applications for individual covariates."

addressing depletion failure and estimating gear efficiency using back-calculation of capture probabilities,program mark; capture probability; removal method; depletion failure; gear selection,FISHERIES RESEARCH,FETHERMAN ER;LEPAK JM,"removal abundance (n) estimation methods are commonly used in fisheries but if capture probability (p) is not accurately estimated accurate estimates of n cannot be obtained. further, if adequate depletions are not achieved during removal, this must be addressed to improve data collection and estimation procedures. here, two disparate research projects are used as case studies to illustrate: (1) a method in program mark for back-calculating p estimated by the removal method following depletion failure; and (2) a program mark modeling approach used to estimate efficiency of gear deployed in removal studies. in the first case study, a depletion failure occurred in white sucker catostomus commersonii populations sampled concurrently with rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss populations using a weighted seine. back-calculation of closed capture-recapture estimates of p was used to account for depletion failure and obtain per-pass estimates of p for both species. the second case study describes a pilot experiment to determine the efficacy of two removal gears deployed to estimate n of fathead minnows pimephales promelas in cattle troughs. back-calculation of p was used to select the appropriate gear to complete removal estimates in future studies. results indicate that using program mark to back-calculate estimates of p allows researchers to detect problems associated with capture that may have resulted in depletion failure. further, the method allows for comparisons of gear efficiency prior to full-scale experimentation.

band reporting rates of waterfowl: does individual heterogeneity bias estimated survival rates?,band recoveries; bias; heterogeneous recovery rates; individual random effects; logit normal; ring recoveries; seber model; waterfowl survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,WHITE GC;CORDES LS;ARNOLD TW,"in capture-recapture studies, the estimation accuracy of demographic parameters is essential to the efficacy of management of hunted animal populations. dead recovery models based upon the reporting of rings or bands are often used for estimating survival of waterfowl and other harvested species. however, distance from the ringing site or condition of the bird may introduce substantial individual heterogeneity in the conditional band reporting rates (r), which could cause bias in estimated survival rates (s) or suggest nonexistent individual heterogeneity in s. to explore these hypotheses, we ran two sets of simulations (n=1000) in mark using seber's dead recovery model, allowing time variation on both s and r. this included a series of heterogeneity models, allowing substantial variation on logit(r), and control models with no heterogeneity. we conducted simulations using two different values of s: s=0.60, which would be typical of dabbling ducks such as mallards (anas platyrhynchos), and s=0.80, which would be more typical of sea ducks or geese. we chose a mean reporting rate on the logit scale of -1.9459 with sd=1.5 for the heterogeneity models (producing a back-transformed mean of 0.196 with sd=0.196, median=0.125) and a constant reporting rate for the control models of 0.196. within these sets of simulations, estimation models where sigma(s)=0 and sigma(s)>0 (sigma(s) is sd of individual survival rates on the logit scale) were incorporated to investigate whether real heterogeneity in r would induce apparent individual heterogeneity in s. models where sigma(s)=0 were selected approximately 91% of the time over models where sigma(s)>0. simulation results showed < 0.05% relative bias in estimating survival rates except for models estimating sigma(s)>0 when true s=0.8, where relative bias was a modest 0.5%. these results indicate that considerable variation in reporting rates does not cause major bias in estimated survival rates of waterfowl, further highlighting the robust nature of dead recovery models that are being used for the management of harvested species."

evidence for plasticity in the frequency of skipped breeding opportunities in common toads,bufo bufo; capture-recapture; life history; temperate zone; temporary emigration,POPULATION ECOLOGY,MUTHS E;SCHERER RD;BOSCH J,"breeding is limited by energetic or environmental constraints and long-lived species sometimes skip breeding opportunities. environmental conditions may vary considerably across the geographic and elevational range of a species and species that can respond through variation in life history strategies are likely to maintain populations at the extremes of their ranges. the decision to skip breeding enables animals to adjust life history to circumstances, and plasticity in behavior allows implementation of adjustments. elevational patterns suggest that breeding may be limited physiologically at high elevations (e.g., greater probability of skipped breeding; resources and environmental conditions more variable) in contrast to low elevations (probability of skipping breeding lower; resources and environmental conditions more predictable). we estimated the probabilities of survival and skipped breeding in a high-elevation population of common toads and compared estimates to existing data for common toads at low elevations, and to another toad species inhabiting a similar high elevation environment. female common toads at high elevations tend to have high probabilities of skipping breeding and survival relative to data for common toads at low elevations, and appear to use a similar strategy of skipping breeding in response to similar environmental constraints as other toads at high elevations. we provide evidence of variability in this aspect of life history for common toads. understanding variation in life history within widely distributed species is critical. knowing that certain life history strategies are employed on a continuum informs conservation efforts, especially as impacts of climate change are likely to be different depending on elevation."

comparison of two life history strategies after impoundment of a historically anadromous stock of columbia river redband trout,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HOLECEK DE;SCARNECCHIA DL,"in this study we collected information on abundance, age structure, migration, and exploitation to characterize the population demographics and reproductive characteristics of a historically anadromous columbia river redband trout oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri population now isolated in a southwestern idaho reservoir and limited to resident and adfluvial life histories. we estimated there were 3,905 adfluvial individuals in mann creek reservoir in october 2008 based on a mark-recapture population estimate. the adfluvial population sex ratio of 2.78 females per male captured at a weir, peak spawn timing near the peak of the hydrograph (late april), age at spawning (4-6years), and growth patterns (slow growth in the stream followed by rapid growth in the reservoir) were all characteristic of an anadromous population. resident fish abundance was not estimated, but the fish were characterized by relatively slow growth, earlier sexual maturity, and a reverse sex ratio (0.23 females per male) compared with the adfluvial fish. the two life histories (resident and adfluvial) and their differential use by the sexes are consistent with life history theory, which suggests female salmonids maximize fitness by increasing body size and fecundity while males attempt to maximize survival at the expense of growth. the migratory fish in this drainage that could have historically exercised an anadromous life history appear to be exercising the next-best option, an adfluvial life history, which has relatively similar costs and benefits to the anadromous form as distinct from the stream-resident form. future studies should evaluate other similar native populations isolated in reservoir systems because these populations could play a role in recovery of endangered steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout) populations in the western usa. received december 4, 2012; accepted april 18, 2013"
effective sociodemographic population assessment of elusive species in ecology and conservation management,camera trapping; chimpanzee; conservation management; density; elephant; gorilla; multiple species monitoring; spatially explicit capture-recapture,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,HEAD JS;BOESCH C;ROBBINS MM;RABANAL LI;MAKAGA L;KUHL HS,"wildlife managers are urgently searching for improved sociodemographic population assessment methods to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented conservation activities. these need to be inexpensive, appropriate for a wide spectrum of species and straightforward to apply by local staff members with minimal training. furthermore, conservation management would benefit from single approaches which cover many aspects of population assessment beyond only density estimates, to include for instance social and demographic structure, movement patterns, or species interactions. remote camera traps have traditionally been used to measure species richness. currently, there is a rapid move toward using remote camera trapping in density estimation, community ecology, and conservation management. here, we demonstrate such comprehensive population assessment by linking remote video trapping, spatially explicit capture- recapture (secr) techniques, and other methods. we apply it to three species: chimpanzees pan troglodytes troglodytes, gorillas gorilla gorilla gorilla, and forest elephants loxodonta cyclotis in loango national park, gabon. all three species exhibited considerable heterogeneity in capture probability at the sex or group level and density was estimated at 1.72, 1.2, and 1.37 individuals per km 2 and male to female sex ratios were 1:2.1, 1:3.2, and 1:2 for chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants, respectively. association patterns revealed four, eight, and 18 independent social groups of chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants, respectively: key information for both conservation management and studies on the species' ecology. additionally, there was evidence of resident and nonresident elephants within the study area and intersexual variation in home range size among elephants but not chimpanzees. our study highlights the potential of combining camera trapping and secr methods in conducting detailed population assessments that go far beyond documenting species diversity patterns or estimating single species population size. our study design is widely applicable to other species and spatial scales, and moderately trained staff members can collect and process the required data. furthermore, assessments using the same method can be extended to include several other ecological, behavioral, and demographic aspects: fission and fusion dynamics and intergroup transfers, birth and mortality rates, species interactions, and ranging patterns."
extensive sampling of polar bears (ursus maritimus) in the northwest passage (canadian arctic archipelago) reveals population differentiation across multiple spatial and temporal scales,conservation genetics; dna microsatellites; marine mammals; mark-recapture; mitochondrial dna; species at risk,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CAMPAGNA L;DE GROOT PJV;SAUNDERS BL;ATKINSON SN;WEBER DS;DYCK MG;BOAG PT;LOUGHEED SC,"as global warming accelerates the melting of arctic sea ice, polar bears (ursus maritimus) must adapt to a rapidly changing landscape. this process will necessarily alter the species distribution together with population dynamics and structure. detailed knowledge of these changes is crucial to delineating conservation priorities. here, we sampled 361 polar bears from across the center of the canadian arctic archipelago spanning the gulf of boothia (gb) and m'clintock channel (mc). we use dna microsatellites and mitochondrial control region sequences to quantify genetic differentiation, estimate gene flow, and infer population history. two populations, roughly coincident with gb and mc, are significantly differentiated at both nuclear (f-st = 0.01) and mitochondrial (f-st = 0.47; f-st = 0.29) loci, allowing bayesian clustering analyses to assign individuals to either group. our data imply that the causes of the mitochondrial and nuclear genetic patterns differ. analysis of mtdna reveals the matrilineal structure dates at least to the holocene, and is common to individuals throughout the species' range. these mtdna differences probably reflect both genetic drift and historical colonization dynamics. in contrast, the differentiation inferred from microsatellites is only on the scale of hundreds of years, possibly reflecting contemporary impediments to gene flow. taken together, our data suggest that gene flow is insufficient to homogenize the gb and mc populations and support the designation of gb and mc as separate polar bear conservation units. our study also provide a striking example of how nuclear dna and mtdna capture different aspects of a species demographic history."

winter weather versus group thermoregulation: what determines survival in hibernating mammals?,climate change; cooperative breeding; hoary marmot; mark-recapture; pacific decadal; oscillation; snowpack; survival; social structure,OECOLOGIA,PATIL VP;MORRISON SF;KARELS TJ;HIK DS,"for socially hibernating mammals, the effectiveness of huddling as a means of energy conservation should increase with group size. however, group size has only been linked to increased survival in a few hibernating species, and the relative importance of social structure versus winter conditions during hibernation remains uncertain. we studied the influence of winter weather conditions, social group composition, age-structure, and other environmental factors and individual attributes on the overwinter survival of hoary marmots (marmota caligata) in the yukon territory, canada. juvenile hoary marmot survival was negatively correlated with the mean winter (november to may) pacific decadal oscillation (pdo) index. survival in older age-classes was negatively correlated with pdo lagged by 1 year. social group size and structure were weakly correlated with survival in comparison to pdo. the relationship between winter pdo and survival was most likely due to the importance of snowpack as insulation during hibernation. the apparent response of hoary marmots to changing winter conditions contrasted sharply with those of other marmot species and other mammalian alpine herbivores. in conclusion, the severity of winter weather may constrain the effectiveness of group thermoregulation in socially hibernating mammals."
temporal variation of juvenile survival in a long-lived species: the role of parasites and body condition,elasticity; mortality; cestodes; body mass; geese,OECOLOGIA,SOUCHAY G;GAUTHIER G;PRADEL R,"studies of population dynamics of long-lived species have generally focused on adult survival because population growth should be most sensitive to this parameter. however, actual variations in population size can often be driven by other demographic parameters, such as juvenile survival, when they show high temporal variability. we used capture-recapture data from a long-term study of a hunted, migratory species, the greater snow goose (chen caerulescens atlantica), to assess temporal variability in first-year survival and the relative importance of natural and hunting mortality. we also conducted a parasite-removal experiment to determine the effect of internal parasites and body condition on temporal variation in juvenile survival. we found that juvenile survival showed a higher temporal variability than adult survival and that natural mortality was more important than hunting mortality, unlike in adults. parasite removal increased first-year survival and reduced its annual variability in females only. body condition at fledging was also positively correlated with first-year survival in treated females. with reduced parasite load, females, which are thought to invest more in their immune system than males according to bateman's principle, could probably reallocate more energy to growth than males, leading to a higher survival. treated birds also had a higher survival than control ones during their second year, suggesting a developmental effect that manifested later in life. our study shows that natural factors such as internal parasites may be a major source of variation in juvenile survival of a long-lived, migratory bird, which has implications for its population dynamics."

anadromous sea lampreys recolonize a maine coastal river tributary after dam removal,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HOGG R;COGHLAN SM;ZYDLEWSKI J,"sedgeunkedunk stream, a third-order tributary to the penobscot river, maine, historically supported several anadromous fishes, including the atlantic salmon salmo salar, alewife alosa pseudoharengus, and sea lamprey petromyzon marinus. however, two small dams constructed in the 1800s reduced or eliminated spawning runs entirely. in 2009, efforts to restore marine-freshwater connectivity in the system culminated with removal of the lowermost dam, thus providing access to an additional 4.6km of lotic habitat. because sea lampreys utilized accessible habitat prior to dam removal, they were chosen as a focal species with which to quantify recolonization. during spawning runs of 2008-2011 (before and after dam removal), individuals were marked with pit tags and their activity was tracked with daily recapture surveys. open-population mark-recapture models indicated a fourfold increase in the annual abundance of spawning-phase sea lampreys, with estimates rising from 59 +/- 4 ((n) over cap +/- se) before dam removal (2008) to 223 +/- 18 and 242 +/- 16 after dam removal (2010 and 2011, respectively). accompanying the marked increase in annual abundance was a greater than fourfold increase in nesting sites: the number of nests increased from 31 in 2008 to 128 and 131 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. during the initial recolonization event (i.e., in 2010), sea lampreys took 6 d to move past the former dam site and 9 d to expand into the furthest upstream reaches. conversely, during the 2011 spawning run, sea lampreys took only 3 d to penetrate into the upstream reaches, thus suggesting a potential positive feedback in which larval recruitment into the system may have attracted adult spawners via conspecific pheromone cues. although more research is needed to verify the migratory pheromone hypothesis, our study clearly demonstrates that small-stream dam removal in coastal river systems has the potential to enhance recovery of declining anadromous fish populations. received march 2, 2013; accepted may 23, 2013"
waterbird demography as indicator of wetland health: the french-wintering common snipe population,capture-recapture; common snipe; sustainable harvest; climate change; leslie matrix; drainage; flyway approach to conservation; multistate model,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,PERON G;FERRAND Y;LERAY G;GIMENEZ O,"the population dynamics of waterbirds constitute an indicator of wetland conservation status. however, waterbird population censuses are difficult to implement because the individuals are very mobile within their range, and some species are elusive or breed in remote areas. therefore, demographic models based on the estimation of survival and breeding success appear as a reliable alternative to population censuses. here we present this model-based approach in the case of the french-wintering snipe population (gallinago gallinago), which breeds mainly in northern and eastern europe. using a multi-state model to accommodate the mobile nature of waterbirds, we estimate snipe survival using a joint analysis of capture-recapture and ring-recovery data. then, we use matrix population models to estimate the minimum recruitment rate required to maintain the population at its current size and derive a chart for using age-ratio of ringed birds as indicator of population trend. although we call for more data collection in order to reduce uncertainty, we conclude that occasional declines are likely after years with poor breeding success, but that the french-wintering snipe population is on average stable. individual-based monitoring data and population modeling make it possible to use waterbirds as indicator species at the flyway scale.

a comparison of methods to estimate shovelnose sturgeon mortality in the mississippi river adjacent to missouri and illinois,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,PHELPS QE;VINING I;HERZOG DP;DAMES R;TRAVNICHEK VH;TRIPP SJ;BOONE M,"mortality is a key parameter in understanding the dynamics of any fish population. we examined three methods to evaluate shovelnose sturgeon scaphirhynchus platorynchus mortality (e.g., ratio of first year recruits to all recruits [heincke's method], a linearized weighted catch curve, and an open system mark-recapture mortality approach). the mississippi river was sampled in two distinct but connected geomorphic sections: upper mississippi river (umr; river kilometer 323-587) and the middle mississippi river (mmr; river kilometer 0-322). all analyses were pooled across these areas due to potential emigration or immigration throughout both study reaches. heincke's method estimated annual mortality at 16.9% for the full range of ages (9-23years) with generally increasing estimates with decreasing age ranges considered (10-23, 11-23, 12-23, and so on). a linearized weighted catch curve that considered increasing estimates of mortality for the shorter age ranges generated an annual mortality estimate of 29.0%.d four mark-recapture models were considered using the program mark. the model with the greatest support was the model that provided estimates of annual mortality for each year and a single recapture probability. the annual mortality estimates from this model varied from 2.7% to 70.7% after correcting for tag loss. the best fit model with a single estimate of annual mortality was the one that estimated annual recapture probabilities for each year and had a mortality estimate of 34.6% (after correcting for tag loss, but not for immigration, emigration, or sampling effort). the three methods provided varying results, and our data indicated that a single method to estimate shovlenose sturgeon mortality rate may not be appropriate. as such, biologists must recognize that disparities in shovelnose sturgeon mortality rates may exist using various methods and should use caution when choosing which method will be employed to estimate sturgeon mortality."
a standardized technique to back-calculate length at age from unsectioned walleye spines,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,MEERBEEK JR;HAWKINS KA,"the primary assumption of using back-calculated length-at-age (bcl) methods to estimate fish growth is that the body length and hard-part radius relationship is linear. therefore, standardized techniques are required for bcl methods to be comparable over time. recent studies have found that unsectioned dorsal spines of sander spp. improve efficiency and provide accurate age estimates. we evaluated a simple, standardized method of using unsectioned walleye s. vitreus (n = 162) dorsal spines to estimate age and bcl (direct-proportion and fraser-lee methods) by comparing these estimates with those of a sectioned spine technique. we validated the technique by comparing observed growth (measured via a mark-recapture study) with bcl growth estimated via sectioned and unsectioned techniques. the time required to process, prepare, view and perform bcl for each of the two techniques was also compared. both reader age estimates and exact reader agreement rates were significantly better using the sectioned spine technique. age frequencies varied significantly among readers and techniques as differences ranged up to 8years. no difference was detected among the slopes of the back-calculation methods among techniques, but there were significant differences in the mean bcl estimates for ages < 10years old. the relationships between observed growth and growth estimated via bcl methods were significant; however, bcl methods significantly overestimated walleye growth. total processing time for the unsectioned technique was significantly less, but based on our poor ability to replicate ages, we do not suggest the use of our standardized unsectioned spine technique to estimate the age or bcl older walleye. in addition, no bcl method accurately estimated annual growth regardless of technique or reader experience. we conclude that more research is necessary to validate dorsal spine-based bcl estimates on walleye populations. once validated, further research evaluating new or modifying our technique for unsectioned walleye spines needs to be explored."

are urban green spaces suitable for woodland carabids? first insights from a short-term experiment,urban ecology; capture-mark-recapture; woodland carabids; abax parallelepipedus; survival probability; urban green space,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,VERGNES A;CHANTEPIE S;ROBERT A;CLERGEAU P,"one consequence of the spatial expansion of cities is the multiplication of highly fragmented and diverse green spaces immediately surrounded by urban areas. whereas the global expansion of urban areas is a growing concern for the viability of woodland arthropods, the suitability of green spaces as refuges to arthropods needs to be clarified. in order to assess and compare the survival rates of the woodland carabid abax parallelepipedus in four types of green urban sites (remnant forest patch, urban park, woody corridor and set of gardens), we conducted a capture-mark-recapture experiment based on 483 individuals collected in a forest located in a natural landscape (considered as the control site) and released into the various green spaces. results indicated strong heterogeneity in survival probability between green spaces. survival rates were slightly higher in the control site than in the remnant forest patch, the urban park and the corridor, which appear suitable for the survival of the species. however, it was substantially lower in the gardens. the analysis further revealed that these differences in survival are largely explained by the differences of within -site habitat fragmentation. by indicating that urban green spaces may contribute unequally to woodland carabids survival, our study highlights that the modification of local environmental conditions alone (increase of temperature, increase of soil pollution and change in food availability) could not explain the negative effect of urbanization. this study argues for the development of corridors in cities in order to favour the colonisation of green spaces by woodland carabids."

"bayesian implementation of a time stratified lincoln-petersen estimator for salmon abundance in the upper matanuska river, alaska, usa",pacific salmon; bayesian modeling; mark-recapture; time stratified; winbugs,FISHERIES RESEARCH,SETHI SA;TANNER TL,"time stratified lincoln-petersen mark-recapture models can generate estimates of salmon abundance that are robust to capture heterogeneity. bayesian implementation of these estimators provides a flexible framework to formulate different model structures, including random effects structures and models with functional relationships between parameters and covariates, and can successfully generate estimates in the face of sparse data. in this article, we used a bayesian time stratified lincoln-petersen model to provide first ever abundance estimates of chum, oncorhynchus keta, coho, o. kisutch, and sockeye salmon, o. nerka, in the upper matanuska river, alaska, usa, using tagging data from 2009. for each species, we formulated a suite of twelve model structures and used deviance information criterion based multimodel inference and model averaging to estimate salmon abundance. model averaged point estimates for upper river 2009 chum, coho, and sockeye salmon were 54,720, 11,430, and 13,750, fish respectively, supporting a growing body of ecological research which demonstrates that glacial river systems can sustain significant pacific salmon runs. results identified time varying probability of capture for chum and coho salmon, and population estimates were 17% and 8% higher, respectively, than estimates from a simple pooled lincoln-petersen model which has been demonstrated to be biased low in the face of capture heterogeneity. capture heterogeneity was not found for sockeye salmon, and the model averaged time stratified and pooled lincoln-petersen estimates agreed closely. time stratified models can potentially produce more accurate estimates, however, the additional model complexity results in less precise abundance estimates compared to the simple pooled lincoln-petersen estimator. published by elsevier b.v."
"larger body size at metamorphosis enhances survival, growth and performance of young cane toads (rhinella marina)",NA,PLOS ONE,CABRERA GUZMAN E;CROSSLAND MR;BROWN GP;SHINE R,"body size at metamorphosis is a key trait in species (such as many anurans) with biphasic life-histories. experimental studies have shown that metamorph size is highly plastic, depending upon larval density and environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, food supply, water quality, chemical cues from conspecifics, predators and competitors). to test the hypothesis that this developmental plasticity is adaptive, or to determine if inducing plasticity can be used to control an invasive species, we need to know whether or not a metamorphosing anuran's body size influences its subsequent viability. for logistical reasons, there are few data on this topic under field conditions. we studied cane toads (rhinella marina) within their invasive australian range. metamorph body size is highly plastic in this species, and our laboratory studies showed that larger metamorphs had better locomotor performance (both on land and in the water), and were more adept at catching and consuming prey. in mark-recapture trials in outdoor enclosures, larger body size enhanced metamorph survival and growth rate under some seasonal conditions. larger metamorphs maintained their size advantage over smaller siblings for at least a month. our data support the critical but rarely-tested assumption that all else being equal, larger body size at metamorphosis is likely to enhance an individual's long term viability. thus, manipulations to reduce body size at metamorphosis in cane toads may help to reduce the ecological impact of this invasive species."

population dynamics and range expansion in nine-banded armadillos,NA,PLOS ONE,LOUGHRY WJ;PEREZ HEYDRICH C;MCDONOUGH CM;OLI MK,"understanding why certain species can successfully colonize new areas while others do not is a central question in ecology. the nine-banded armadillo (dasypus novemcinctus) is a conspicuous example of a successful invader, having colonized much of the southern united states in the last 200 years. we used 15 years (1992-2006) of capture-mark-recapture data from a population of armadillos in northern florida in order to estimate, and examine relationships among, various demographic parameters that may have contributed to this ongoing range expansion. modeling across a range of values for gamma, the probability of juveniles surviving in the population until first capture, we found that population growth rates varied from 0.80 for gamma = 0.1, to 1.03 for gamma = 1.0. growth rates approached 1.0 only when gamma >= 0.80, a situation that might not occur commonly because of the high rate of disappearance of juveniles. net reproductive rate increased linearly with gamma, but life expectancy (estimated at 3 years) was independent of gamma. we also found that growth rates were lower during a 3-year period of hardwood removal that removed preferred habitat than in the years preceding or following. life-table response experiment (ltre) analysis indicated the decrease in growth rate during logging was primarily due to changes in survival rates of adults. likewise, elasticity analyses of both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates revealed that survival parameters were more influential on population growth than were those related to reproduction. collectively, our results are consistent with recent theories regarding biological invasions which posit that populations no longer at the leading edge of range expansion do not exhibit strong positive growth rates, and that high reproductive output is less critical in predicting the likelihood of successful invasion than are life-history strategies that emphasize allocation of resources to future, as opposed to current, reproduction."

influence of data quality and quantity from a multiyear tagging program on an integrated fish stock assessment,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,ZIEGLER PE,"using a modeling framework for toothfish (dissostichus spp.) population dynamics, fishing, and data collection, this study investigated how the bias and precision of biomass estimates from an integrated tag-based assessment are influenced by various aspects of a multiyear tagging program, particularly the effects of the size of tagged fish compared with the size of fish in the catch (tag size-overlap), numbers of tagged fish, duration of the tagging program, using catch-at-length or catch-at-age data as auxiliary data, and stock depletion levels. biomass estimates generally improved with more and better-quality tagging data. the results showed that even when tag releases were distributed over a relatively large number of size classes, low recapture numbers collected in short tagging programs with a 100% tag size-overlap were sufficient for robust and unbiased assessments. particularly in the early stages of the tagging program, a high tag size-overlap was imperative to maximize the likelihood of a robust assessment. biomass estimates were largely unaffected by the stock depletion level; however, using catch-at-age compared with catch-at-length improved recruitment estimates and resulted in more conservative biomass estimates."
integrated modeling of bilateral photo-identification data in mark-recapture analyses,abundance; latent multinomial; mark-resight; noninvasive capture-recapture; photo-identification; remote camera trapping,ECOLOGY,MCCLINTOCK BT;CONN PB;ALONSO RS;CROOKS KR,"when natural marks provide sufficient resolution to identify individual animals, noninvasive sampling using cameras has a number of distinct advantages relative to traditional mark-recapture methods. however, analyses from photo-identification records often pose additional challenges. for example, it is often unclear how to link left- and right-side photos to the same individual, and previous studies have primarily used data from just one side for statistical inference. here we describe how a recently developed statistical method can be adapted for integrated mark-recapture analyses using bilateral photo-identification records. the approach works by assuming that the true encounter history for each animal is a latent (unobserved) realization from a multinomial distribution. based on the type of photo encounter (e.g., right, left, or both sides), the recorded (observed) encounter histories can only arise from certain combinations of these latent histories. in this manner, the approach properly accounts for uncertainty about the true number of distinct animals observed in the study. using a markov chain monte carlo sampling procedure, we conduct a small simulation study to show that this approach has reasonable properties and outperforms other methods. we further illustrate our approach by estimating population size from bobcat photo-identification records. although motivated by bilateral photo-identification records, we note that the proposed methodology can be used to combine and jointly analyze other types of mark-recapture data (e.g., photo and dna records)."
effects of sampling conditions on dna-based estimates of american black bear abundance,american black bear; capture heterogeneity; capture-mark-recapture; dna sampling; great smoky mountains national park; model averaging; population abundance; simulations; ursus americanus,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,LAUFENBERG JS;VAN MANEN FT;CLARK JD,"dna-based capture-mark-recapture techniques are commonly used to estimate american black bear (ursus americanus) population abundance (n). although the technique is well established, many questions remain regarding study design. in particular, relationships among n, capture probability of heterogeneity mixtures a and b (pa and pb, respectively, or (p) over bar, collectively), the proportion of each mixture (pi), number of capture occasions (k), and probability of obtaining reliable estimates of n are not fully understood. we investigated these relationships using 1) an empirical dataset of dna samples for which true n was unknown and 2) simulated datasets with known properties that represented a broader array of sampling conditions. for the empirical data analysis, we used the full closed population with heterogeneity data type in program mark to estimate n for a black bear population in great smoky mountains national park, tennessee. we systematically reduced the number of those samples used in the analysis to evaluate the effect that changes in capture probabilities may have on parameter estimates. model-averaged n for females and males were 161 (95% ci=114-272) and 100 (95% ci=74-167), respectively (pooled n=261, 95% ci=192-419), and the average weekly (p) over bar was 0.09 for females and 0.12 for males. when we reduced the number of samples of the empirical data, support for heterogeneity models decreased. for the simulation analysis, we generated capture data with individual heterogeneity covering a range of sampling conditions commonly encountered in dna-based capture-mark-recapture studies and examined the relationships between those conditions and accuracy (i.e., probability of obtaining an estimated n that is within 20% of true n), coverage (i.e., probability that 95% confidence interval includes true n), and precision (i.e., probability of obtaining a coefficient of variation 20%) of estimates using logistic regression. the capture probability for the larger of 2 mixture proportions of the population (i.e., pa or pb, depending on the value of ) was most important for predicting accuracy and precision, whereas capture probabilities of both mixture proportions (pa and pb) were important to explain variation in coverage. based on sampling conditions similar to parameter estimates from the empirical dataset (pa=0.30, pb=0.05, n=250, =0.15, and k=10), predicted accuracy and precision were low (60% and 53%, respectively), whereas coverage was high (94%). increasing pb, the capture probability for the predominate but most difficult to capture proportion of the population, was most effective to improve accuracy under those conditions. however, manipulation of other parameters may be more effective under different conditions. in general, the probabilities of obtaining accurate and precise estimates were best when p<overbar>0.2. our regression models can be used by managers to evaluate specific sampling scenarios and guide development of sampling frameworks or to assess reliability of dna-based capture-mark-recapture studies.

top-down and bottom-up influences on demographic rates of antarctic fur seals arctocephalus gazella,antarctic oscillation; cormack jolly seber; detection probability; el nino southern oscillation; pinniped; shetland islands; southern annular mode; tag loss,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,SCHWARZ LK;GOEBEL ME;COSTA DP;KILPATRICK AM,"two major drivers in population dynamics are bottom-up processes, such as environmental factors that affect foraging success, and the top-down impacts of predation. many populations of marine mammal and seabird species appear to be declining in response to reductions in prey associated with the bottom-up effects of climate change. however, predation, which usually occurs at sea and is difficult to observe, may also play a key role. we analysed drivers of population dynamics of antarctic fur seals arctocephalus gazella at cape shirreff from 1997 to 2009, including a predator that targets pre-weaned pups and bottom-up environmental effects in an ecosystem particularly sensitive to small changes in temperature. we use bayesian mark-recapture analysis to demonstrate that although large-scale environmental variability affects annual adult survival and reproduction, first year survival appears to be driving the current decline in this population (as defined by a decline in the annual number of pups born). although the number of pups increased during the first third of the study, first year survival and recruitment of those pups in later years was very low. such low survival may be driven by leopard seal hydrurga leptonyx predation, particularly prior to weaning. our results suggest that without leopard seal predation, this population would most likely increase in size, despite the observed bottom-up effects of climate changes on adult vital rates. more broadly, our results show how age-targeted predation could be a major factor in population decline of k-selected colonial breeders."
anthropogenic subsidies mitigate environmental variability for insular rodents,anthropogenic resources; mediterranean islands; population dynamics; rattus rattus; trophic subsidies,OECOLOGIA,RUFFINO L;RUSSELL J;VIDAL E,"the exogenous input of nutrients and energy into island systems fuels a large array of consumers and drives bottom-up trophic cascades in island communities. the input of anthropogenic resources has increased on islands and particularly supplemented non-native consumers with extra resources. we test the hypothesis that the anthropogenic establishments of super-abundant gulls and invasive iceplants carpobrotus spp. have both altered the dynamics of an introduced black rat rattus rattus population. on bagaud island, two habitats have been substantially modified by the anthropogenic subsidies of gulls and iceplants, in contrast to the native mediterranean scrubland with no anthropogenic inputs. rats were trapped in all three habitats over two contrasting years of rainfall patterns to investigate: (1) the effect of anthropogenic subsidies on rat density, age-ratio and growth rates, and (2) the role of rainfall variability in modulating the effects of subsidies between years. we found that the growth rates of rats dwelling in the non-subsidized habitat varied with environmental fluctuation, whereas rats dwelling in the gull colony maintained high growth rates during both dry and rainy years. the presence of anthropogenic subsidies apparently mitigated environmental stress. age ratio and rat density varied significantly and predictably among years, seasons, and habitats. while rat densities always peaked higher in the gull colony, especially after rat breeding in spring, higher captures of immature rats were recorded during the second year in all habitats, associated with higher rainfall. the potential for non-native rats to benefit from anthropogenic resources has important implications for the management of similar species on islands."
birth-year and current-year influences on survival and recruitment rates of female weddell seals,capture-mark-recapture; environmental variability; marine mammal; mcmurdo sound; pinniped; southern ocean,POPULATION ECOLOGY,STAUFFER GE;ROTELLA JJ;GARROTT RA,"in long-lived species, juvenile survival typically is lower and more variable than adult survival, and modeling such variation is important for understanding population dynamics. variability in juvenile survival can be related to birth- or current-year influences, and the birth-year influences can be transient, persistent, or intermediate in duration. we used multi-state models and data collected from 5,459 known-aged prebreeder female weddell seals (leptonychotes weddellii lesson) tagged in erebus bay, antarctica from 1980-2007 to evaluate the duration of potential birth-year influences on survival rates and the importance of birth- and current-year influences on survival and recruitment rates. survival rates differed for each birth cohort and were positively related to current-year winter sea-ice conditions. the estimated duration of birth-cohort effects on survival was intermediate (6 years) rather than transient (2 years) or permanent. estimated survivorship from birth to 6 years of age varied among cohorts from 0.13 (se = 0.04) to 0.42 (se = 0.06), and averaged 0.25 (se = 0.02). recruitment rates (probability of transitioning from prebreeder to breeder state) varied annually but apparently were not related to birth-year conditions. our results provide evidence that birth- and current-year conditions act in combination to influence survival. although for many long-lived species the influences of either birth- or current-year conditions on survival are well-studied, we suggest that modeling survival rates as a function of birth- and current-year influences simultaneously could lead to better understanding of survival and improved stochastic models to project population dynamics."
beak marks on butterfly wings with special reference to japanese black swallowtail,avian predation; butterfly; marking; population; recapture; wing length,POPULATION ECOLOGY,KIRITANI K;YAMASHITA H;YAMAMURA K,"birds are believed to be one of the principal predators of butterflies. the beak marks (bms) left on the butterfly wings are useful indices of bird predation. we performed 84 collections in grasslands and woodlands during 2002-2006 in ito, shizuoka prefecture, and collected 893 specimens belonging to 48 species. in general, the larger was the body size the higher was the bm rate. there were two peaks in the bm rate and the peaks were higher by 13-14 % in autumn than in spring in both grasslands and woodlands. during 2007 and 2008, capture-mark-recapture surveys were conducted 82 times in a flight path of black swallowtail butterflies (bsbs). a total of 443 bsb were individually marked and released at a site 400 m away from the flight path after examining for bm, degree of wing damage, body size, sex and species. the bm% of bsb ranged from 40 to 46 %, which was the highest among the observed butterflies. the recapture rate was negatively correlated with the bm rate suggesting that the avian predation was strong enough to affect the survival rate of bsb adults. in addition, the bm rate showed a delayed positive response to bsb density in the previous month. variation in the bm rate was analyzed with a multivariate model; it indicated that month and wing length were significant explanatory variables. in addition, the highest bm rate was observed at an intermediate wing size. these results strongly suggested that variation in the bm rate was caused by variation in avian life history and predator size. all the evidence suggested that an appreciable predation pressure by birds operated on bsb adult populations."
selection on dispersal in isolated butterfly metapopulations,habitat fragmentation; maculinea; mark-recapture; mortality; virtual migration model,POPULATION ECOLOGY,BONELLI S;VRABEC V;WITEK M;BARBERO F;PATRICELLI D;NOWICKI P,"in most metapopulation models dispersal is assumed to be a fixed species-specific trait, but in reality dispersal abilities are highly sensitive to various selective pressures. strict isolation of a metapopulation, which precludes any influx of immigrants (and their genes) from outside and makes it impossible for emigrants to reach other localities with suitable habitat, thus reducing fitness benefits of long-distance dispersal to zero, may be expected to impose strong selection against dispersal. we tested the above prediction by comparing dispersal parameters derived with the virtual migration model for isolated and non-isolated metapopulations of two species of large blue maculinea (= phengaris) butterflies, surveyed with intensive mark-recapture. mortality during dispersal was found to be twice (in m. teleius) to five times higher (in m. arion) in isolated metapopulations. isolation also resulted in significantly reduced dispersal distances in isolated metapopulations, with the effect being particularly strong in m. arion females. apart from its evolutionary and ecological consequences, dispersal depression in isolated butterfly metapopulations implied by our results has serious conservation implications. it provides a clear argument against using parameter values obtained in a different environmental setting in modelling applications, e.g., population viability analyses or environmental impact assessment. furthermore, it underlines the importance of establishing well-connected networks of suitable habitats prior to species release in areas where reintroductions are planned."
dependent vs. independent juvenile survival: contrasting drivers of variation and the buffering effect of parental care,california; juvenile survival; mark-recapture; melospiza melodia; palomarin; post-fledging survival; song sparrow; weather,ECOLOGY,DYBALA KE;GARDALI T;EADIE JM,"juvenile survival is often found to be more sensitive than adult survival to variation in environmental conditions, and variation in juvenile survival can have significant impacts on population growth rates and viability. therefore, understanding the population-level effects of environmental changes requires understanding the effects on juvenile survival. we hypothesized that parental care will buffer the survival of dependent juveniles from variation in environmental conditions, while the survival of independent juveniles will respond more strongly to environmental variation and, in turn, drive the overall variation in annual juvenile survival. we tested this parental-care hypothesis using a 30-year mark-recapture data set to model the survival of juvenile song sparrows (melospiza melodia) during the dependent and independent stages. we examined the effects of weather, density, and cohort mean fledge date and body mass on annual variation in survival during the first 12 weeks after fledging, as well as effects of individual fledge date and body mass on individual variation in survival. the primary driver of annual variation in juvenile survival was precipitation during the previous rainy season, consistent with an effect on food availability, which had a strong positive effect on the survival of independent juveniles, but no effect on dependent juveniles. we also found strong support for effects of body mass and fledge date on individual survival probability, including striking differences in the effect of fledge date by stage. our results provided evidence that different mechanisms influence juvenile survival during each stage of fledgling development, and that parental care buffers the survival of dependent juveniles from variation in environmental conditions. consequently, variation in juvenile survival was driven by independent juveniles, not dependent juveniles, and studies focused only on survival during the dependent stage may not be able to detect the major drivers of variation in juvenile survival. we recommend that future efforts to understand or project the population-level effects of environmental change not only examine the effects on juvenile survival, but specifically consider the survival of independent juveniles, as well as how the drivers of variation in juvenile survival may vary by stage."
"monitoring strategy for eight amphibian species in french guiana, south america",NA,PLOS ONE,COURTOIS EA;DEVILLECHABROLLE J;DEWYNTER M;PINEAU K;GAUCHER P;CHAVE J,"although dramatic amphibian declines have been documented worldwide, only few of such events have been quantitatively documented for the tropical forests of south america. this is due partly to the fact that tropical amphibians are patchily distributed and difficult to detect. we tested three methods often used to monitor population trends in amphibian species in a remote lowland tropical forest of french guiana. these methods are capture-mark-recapture (cmr), estimation of the number of calling males with repeated counts data and distance sampling, and rates of occupancy inferred by presence/absence data. we monitored eight diurnal, terrestrial amphibian species including five dendrobatidae and three bufonidae. we found that cmr, the most precise way of estimating population size, can be used only with two species in high density patches where the recapture rate is high enough. only for one of the species (dendrobates tinctorius), a low coefficient of variation (cv = 0.19) can be achieved with 15 to 20 capture events. for dendrobatid species with day-calling males, audio surveys yield a better probability of detection with only 8 audio surveys needed; quantitative estimates can be achieved by computing the number of calling males inferred from audio counts or distance sampling analysis. we therefore suggest that an efficient monitoring protocol for neotropical amphibian species should include a combination of sighting and audio techniques, and we discuss the need of implementing a large-scale monitoring in order to provide a baseline for comparison with future changes."
optimising camera traps for monitoring small mammals,NA,PLOS ONE,GLEN AS;COCKBURN S;NICHOLS M;EKANAYAKE J;WARBURTON B,"practical techniques are required to monitor invasive animals, which are often cryptic and occur at low density. camera traps have potential for this purpose, but may have problems detecting and identifying small species. a further challenge is how to standardise the size of each camera's field of view so capture rates are comparable between different places and times. we investigated the optimal specifications for a low-cost camera trap for small mammals. the factors tested were 1) trigger speed, 2) passive infrared vs. microwave sensor, 3) white vs. infrared flash, and 4) still photographs vs. video. we also tested a new approach to standardise each camera's field of view. we compared the success rates of four camera trap designs in detecting and taking recognisable photographs of captive stoats (mustela erminea), feral cats (felis catus) and hedgehogs (erinaceus europaeus). trigger speeds of 0.2-2.1 s captured photographs of all three target species unless the animal was running at high speed. the camera with a microwave sensor was prone to false triggers, and often failed to trigger when an animal moved in front of it. a white flash produced photographs that were more readily identified to species than those obtained under infrared light. however, a white flash may be more likely to frighten target animals, potentially affecting detection probabilities. video footage achieved similar success rates to still cameras but required more processing time and computer memory. placing two camera traps side by side achieved a higher success rate than using a single camera. camera traps show considerable promise for monitoring invasive mammal control operations. further research should address how best to standardise the size of each camera's field of view, maximise the probability that an animal encountering a camera trap will be detected, and eliminate visible or audible cues emitted by camera traps."
determining occurrence dynamics when false positives occur: estimating the range dynamics of wolves from public survey data,NA,PLOS ONE,MILLER DAW;NICHOLS JD;GUDE JA;RICH LN;PODRUZNY KM;HINES JE;MITCHELL MS,"large-scale presence-absence monitoring programs have great promise for many conservation applications. their value can be limited by potential incorrect inferences owing to observational errors, especially when data are collected by the public. to combat this, previous analytical methods have focused on addressing non-detection from public survey data. misclassification errors have received less attention but are also likely to be a common component of public surveys, as well as many other data types. we derive estimators for dynamic occupancy parameters (extinction and colonization), focusing on the case where certainty can be assumed for a subset of detections. we demonstrate how to simultaneously account for non-detection (false negatives) and misclassification (false positives) when estimating occurrence parameters for gray wolves in northern montana from 2007-2010. our primary data source for the analysis was observations by deer and elk hunters, reported as part of the state's annual hunter survey. this data was supplemented with data from known locations of radio-collared wolves. we found that occupancy was relatively stable during the years of the study and wolves were largely restricted to the highest quality habitats in the study area. transitions in the occupancy status of sites were rare, as occupied sites almost always remained occupied and unoccupied sites remained unoccupied. failing to account for false positives led to over estimation of both the area inhabited by wolves and the frequency of turnover. the ability to properly account for both false negatives and false positives is an important step to improve inferences for conservation from large-scale public surveys. the approach we propose will improve our understanding of the status of wolf populations and is relevant to many other data types where false positives are a component of observations."
the use of a combination of alkb primers to better characterize the distribution of alkane-degrading bacteria,NA,PLOS ONE,JURELEVICIUS D;ALVAREZ VM;PEIXOTO R;ROSADO AS;SELDIN L,"the alkane monooxygenase alkb, which is encoded by the alkb gene, is a key enzyme involved in bacterial alkane degradation. to study the alkb gene within bacterial communities, researchers need to be aware of the variations in alkb nucleotide sequences; a failure to consider the sequence variations results in the low representation of the diversity and richness of alkane-degrading bacteria. to minimize this shortcoming, the use of a combination of three alkb-targeting primers to enhance the detection of the alkb gene in previously isolated alkane-degrading bacteria was proposed. using this approach, alkb-related pcr products were detected in 79% of the strains tested. furthermore, the chosen set of primers was used to study alkb richness and diversity in different soils sampled in carmopolis, brazil and king george island, antarctica. the dna extracted from the different soils was pcr amplified with each set of alkb-targeting primers, and clone libraries were constructed, sequenced and analyzed. a total of 255 alkb phylotypes were detected. venn diagram analyses revealed that only low numbers of alkb phylotypes were shared among the different libraries derived from each primer pair. therefore, the combination of three alkb-targeting primers enhanced the richness of alkb phylotypes detected in the different soils by 45% to 139%, when compared to the use of a single alkb-targeting primer. in addition, a dendrogram analysis and beta diversity comparison of the alkb composition showed that each of the sampling sites studied had a particular set of alkane-degrading bacteria. the use of a combination of alkb primers was an efficient strategy for enhancing the detection of the alkb gene in cultivable bacteria and for better characterizing the distribution of alkane-degrading bacteria in different soil environments."

gauging the threat: the first population estimate for white sharks in south africa using photo identification and automated software,NA,PLOS ONE,TOWNER AV;WCISEL MA;REISINGER RR;EDWARDS D;JEWELL OJD,"south africa is reputed to host the world's largest remaining population of white sharks, yet no studies have accurately determined a population estimate based on mark-recapture of live individuals. we used dorsal fin photographs (fin ids) to identify white sharks in gansbaai, south africa, from january 2007 - december 2011. we used the computer programme darwin to catalogue and match fin ids of individuals; this is the first study to successfully use the software for white shark identification. the programme performed well despite a number of individual fins showing drastic changes in dorsal fin shape over time. of 1682 fin ids used, 532 unique individuals were identified. we estimated population size using the open-population popan parameterisation in program mark, which estimated the superpopulation size at 908 (95% confidence interval 808-1008). this estimated population size is considerably larger than those described at other aggregation areas of the species and is comparable to a previous south african population estimate conducted 16 years prior. our assessment suggests the species has not made a marked recovery since being nationally protected in 1991. as such, additional international protection may prove vital for the long-term conservation of this threatened species."
"using hierarchical bayes to understand movement, health, and survival in the endangered north atlantic right whale",NA,PLOS ONE,SCHICK RS;KRAUS SD;ROLLAND RM;KNOWLTON AR;HAMILTON PK;PETTIS HM;KENNEY RD;CLARK JS,"body condition is an indicator of health, and it plays a key role in many vital processes for mammalian species. while evidence of individual body condition can be obtained, these observations provide just brief glimpses into the health state of the animal. an analytical framework is needed for understanding how health of animals changes over space and time. through knowledge of individual health we can better understand the status of populations. this is particularly important in endangered species, where the consequences of disruption of critical biological functions can push groups of animals rapidly toward extinction. here we built a state-space model that provides estimates of movement, health, and survival. we assimilated 30+ years of photographic evidence of body condition and three additional visual health parameters in individual north atlantic right whales, together with survey data, to infer the true health status as it changes over space and time. we also included the effect of reproductive status and entanglement status on health. at the population level, we estimated differential movement patterns in males and females. at the individual level, we estimated the likely animal locations each month. we estimated the relationship between observed and latent health status. observations of body condition, skin condition, cyamid infestation on the blowholes, and rake marks all provided measures of the true underlying health. the resulting time series of individual health highlight both normal variations in health status and how anthropogenic stressors can affect the health and, ultimately, the survival of individuals. this modeling approach provides information for monitoring of health in right whales, as well as a framework for integrating observational data at the level of individuals up through the health status of the population. this framework can be broadly applied to a variety of systems - terrestrial and marine - where sporadic observations of individuals exist."
"monitoring dolphins in an urban marine system: total and effective population size estimates of indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins in moreton bay, australia",NA,PLOS ONE,ANSMANN IC;LANYON JM;SEDDON JM;PARRA GJ,"moreton bay, queensland, australia is an area of high biodiversity and conservation value and home to two sympatric sub-populations of indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins (tursiops aduncus). these dolphins live in close proximity to major urban developments. successful management requires information regarding their abundance. here, we estimate total and effective population sizes of bottlenose dolphins in moreton bay using photo-identification and genetic data collected during boat-based surveys in 2008-2010. abundance (n-e) was estimated using open population mark-recapture models based on sighting histories of distinctive individuals. effective population size (ne) was estimated using the linkage disequilibrium method based on nuclear genetic data at 20 microsatellite markers in skin samples, and corrected for bias caused by overlapping generations (n(e)c). a total of 174 sightings of dolphin groups were recorded and 365 different individuals identified. over the whole of moreton bay, a population size n of 554 +/- 22.2 (se) (95% ci: 510-598) was estimated. the southern bay sub-population was small at an estimated n = 193 +/- 6.4 (se) (95% ci: 181-207), while the north sub-population was more numerous, with 446 +/- 56 (se) (95% ci: 336-556) individuals. the small estimated effective population size of the southern sub-population (n(e)c = 56, 95% ci: 33-128) raises conservation concerns. a power analysis suggested that to reliably detect small (5%) declines in size of this population would require substantial survey effort (>4 years of annual mark-recapture surveys) at the precision levels achieved here. to ensure that ecological as well as genetic diversity within this population of bottlenose dolphins is preserved, we consider that north and south sub-populations should be treated as separate management units. systematic surveys over smaller areas holding locally-adapted sub-populations are suggested as an alternative method for increasing ability to detect abundance trends."

fish passage through culverts in central michigan warmwater streams,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,BRIGGS AS;GALAROWICZ TL,"road culverts can alter stream flow, remove fish habitat, and limit fish movement. little is known about the effects of culverts on fish movement in low-order, low-gradient streams in an agricultural setting. eleven sites on first- and second-order streams in central michigan were examined for the effects of culvert type (box, bottomless box, pipe arch, and bottomless pipe arch) on fish passage in an agricultural setting. the selected culverts were not obvious barriers to fish passage as none were perched above the stream. four reaches (two upstream and two downstream of a culvert) were sampled three times in spring, summer, and fall 2011 at each site. mark-recapture sampling was used to observe fish movement, and the probability of fewer fish being found upstream of a culvert relative to downstream was modeled with logistic regression. based on recapture movements, limited passage was assumed for at least one fish species during each season at a pipe arch culvert and for one species during summer at a box culvert. the best models from logistic regression revealed that culvert length had the largest effect on the proportion of creek chub semotilus atromaculatus being found upstream out of the variables used. fishxing, a computer program used to predict fish passage through culverts, predicted that five culverts had passage-limiting flows to either western blacknose dace rhinichthys obtusus or creek chub during at least one season. however, all culverts were predicted to have some passable flows during each season (except one culvert during one season). results suggest that even though culverts may not be obvious barriers, fish passage can still be limited. received november 15, 2012; accepted march 12, 2013"

the matrix affects trackway corridor suitability for an arenicolous specialist beetle,connectivity; ecological network; dispersal; harpalus rufipalpis; carabidae,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,BERTONCELJ I;DOLMAN PM,"in conserving regional insect diversity dispersal corridors are advocated to counteract fragmentation and for resilience to climate change. however, influences of corridor design and management on their function are poorly understood. effects of contrasting matrix structure on the suitability and function of trackways as corridors for dispersal of an arenicolous carabid beetle, harpalus rufipalpis (sturm), was studied within a plantation landscape using mark-release-recapture. a total of 1,120 marked h. rufipalpis were released into four trackways: two ""open"" trackways surrounded by pine plantations aged 13-16 years and two ""shaded"" trackways surrounded by plantations aged 26-37 years. dispersal was monitored by a grid of pitfall transects placed across trackways at intervals of four meters, extending 44 m north and south of the release point. numbers of resident and marked recaptured h. rufipalpis, their average daily movement rates and numbers of recaptures in the north and south direction were compared between open and shaded trackways using 238 recaptures. the surrounding matrix affected trackway suitability with greater abundance of resident beetles found in open trackways; however h. rufipalpis was also naturally present in shaded trackways. h. rufipalpis were more active in low quality shaded corridors as inferred from the greater number of recaptures and from greater daily movement rates. corridor edge permeability differed between trackway types, with more individuals leaving the corridor to enter the matrix in the less suitable shaded trackways. thus matrix type affected the potential habitat suitability and conduit function of trackway corridors."
assessing the mandatory bovine abortion notification system in france using unilist capture-recapture approach,NA,PLOS ONE,BRONNER A;HENAUX V;VERGNE T;VINARD JL;MORIGNAT E;HENDRIKX P;CALAVAS D;GAY E,"the mandatory bovine abortion notification system in france aims to detect as soon as possible any resurgence of bovine brucellosis. however, under-reporting seems to be a major limitation of this system. we used a unilist capture-recapture approach to assess the sensitivity, i.e. the proportion of farmers who reported at least one abortion among those who detected such events, and representativeness of the system during 2006-2011. we implemented a zero-inflated poisson model to estimate the proportion of farmers who detected at least one abortion, and among them, the proportion of farmers not reporting. we also applied a hurdle model to evaluate the effect of factors influencing the notification process. we found that the overall surveillance sensitivity was about 34%, and was higher in beef than dairy cattle farms. the observed increase in the proportion of notifying farmers from 2007 to 2009 resulted from an increase in the surveillance sensitivity in 2007/2008 and an increase in the proportion of farmers who detected at least one abortion in 2008/2009. these patterns suggest a raise in farmers' awareness in 2007/2008 when the bluetongue virus (btv) was detected in france, followed by an increase in the number of abortions in 2008/2009 as btv spread across the country. our study indicated a lack of sensitivity of the mandatory bovine abortion notification system, raising concerns about the ability to detect brucellosis outbreaks early. with the increasing need to survey the zoonotic rift valley fever and q fever diseases that may also cause bovine abortions, our approach is of primary interest for animal health stakeholders to develop information programs to increase abortion notifications. our framework combining hurdle and zip models may also be applied to estimate the completeness of other clinical surveillance systems."
body condition correlates with instantaneous growth in stream-dwelling rainbow trout and arctic grayling,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,BENTLEY KT;SCHINDLER DE,"understanding the growth response of fish to varying environmental and biological conditions is important for the management and conservation of populations and communities. however, obtaining growth data at time scales shorter than those provided by annual size-at-age relationships is costly and labor intensive and can be logistically impractical. we assessed the ability of a body condition index to serve as a proxy for individual instantaneous growth rates in two species of mostly subadult stream-dwelling salmonids in southwestern alaska. we found that relative body condition, as measured by the residuals around a length-mass regression, was strongly correlated with direct measures of individual instantaneous growth (day(-1)) from mark-recapture data. further, body condition was significantly correlated with growth accumulated over a period of roughly 2-10 weeks in both rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss and arctic grayling thymallus arcticus, while the relationship was typically weaker for time periods of less than 2 weeks and greater than 1 year. despite the limitations of using body condition indices to infer the physiological status of individuals, our results demonstrate that, when applied judiciously, body condition can be used as a surrogate for recent individual instantaneous growth rate. received june 30, 2012; accepted january 9, 2013"
improved variance estimates of biomass for stream-dwelling fish calculated using removal estimators,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,SHEPARD BB;TAPER ML;ZALE AV,"total biomass of fish populations has traditionally been computed by multiplying the mean weight of captured fish by the estimated abundance of fish. the variance estimator for this method overestimates variance when a moderate to large portion of the population is sampled. we developed and evaluated finite population correction (fpc) methods for estimating fish biomass in small streams (<5m wetted width) in conjunction with removal population estimators. using simulated data we found that removal estimates could deviate by more than 50% from true population abundances and be biased when the ratio of total captured fish to the estimated abundance was less than 0.6. these deviations were generally not biased and within 25% of the true population when the ratio was 0.6 or higher. to estimate biomass using fpc methods we investigated a classical a priori sample design and an a posteriori modeled estimator. both methods take advantage of the fact that relatively high proportions of total populations are typically captured (and can be weighed) in small streams during removal estimates. the a posteriori model-based method can be used to partition estimates of variance and incorporate measurement error, but the a priori design cannot. estimates of biomass using all three methods were identical. however, precision of fpc methods was significantly better (wilcoxon paired sign-ranked test: p < 0.001) than the traditional method. coverage by 95% confidence intervals for the model-based fpc method were much closer to the 95% nominal level than for the traditional method, especially when capture probabilities were higher than 0.5. we recommend using the model-based fpc method because it reduces estimates of se as the sample size (n) approaches the population size (n) and it provides the most reliable 95% confidence intervals. received september 20, 2012; accepted january 18, 2013"
growth of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in warm-temperate lakes: implications for environmental change,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,BLAIR JM;OSTROVSKY I;HICKS BJ;PITKETHLEY RJ;SCHOLES P,"to predict potential effects of climate and anthropogenic impacts on fish growth, we compared growth rates of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in nine closely located warm-temperate lakes of contrasting morphometry, stratification and mixing regime, and trophic state. analyses of long-term mark-recapture data showed that in deep oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes, trout growth rates increased with increasing indices of lake productivity. in contrast, in shallow eutrophic lakes, where fish habitat volume is constrained by temperature and dissolved oxygen, trout growth rates declined with increasing productivity. growth rates were higher in lakes with greater volumes of favourable habitat (i.e., dissolved oxygen > 6.0 mg.l-1 and temperature < 21 degrees c) and lower in lakes with increased turbidity, chlorophyll a, and nitrogen concentrations. our findings suggest that increases in lake productivity and temperatures as a result of global climatic change are likely to be more detrimental to salmonid habitat quality in shallower, productive lakes, while salmonids will better endure such changes in deeper, oligotrophic lakes. fishery managers can use this information to aid future stocking decisions for salmonid fisheries in warm-temperate climates."
using pedigree reconstruction to estimate population size: genotypes are more than individually unique marks,census; lion; mark-recapture; pedigree reconstruction; population estimate; population size,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,CREEL S;ROSENBLATT E,"estimates of population size are critical for conservation and management, but accurate estimates are difficult to obtain for many species. noninvasive genetic methods are increasingly used to estimate population size, particularly in elusive species such as large carnivores, which are difficult to count by most other methods. in most such studies, genotypes are treated simply as unique individual identifiers. here, we develop a new estimator of population size based on pedigree reconstruction. the estimator accounts for individuals that were directly sampled, individuals that were not sampled but whose genotype could be inferred by pedigree reconstruction, and individuals that were not detected by either of these methods. monte carlo simulations show that the population estimate is unbiased and precise if sampling is of sufficient intensity and duration. simulations also identified sampling conditions that can cause the method to overestimate or underestimate true population size; we present and discuss methods to correct these potential biases. the method detected 221% more individuals than were directly sampled across a broad range of simulated sampling schemes. genotypes are more than unique identifiers, and the information about relationships in a set of genotypes can improve estimates of population size."
variability in temporary emigration rates of individually marked female weddell seals prior to first reproduction,capture-mark-recapture; colonial breeding; condition-dependent; leptonychotes weddellii; open robust design; recruitment; social learning; trade-offs; unobservable states,OECOLOGIA,STAUFFER GE;ROTELLA JJ;GARROTT RA,"in many species, temporary emigration (te) is a phenomenon, often indicative of life-history characteristics such as dormancy, skipped reproduction, or partial migration, whereby certain individuals in a population are temporarily unobservable at a particular site. te may be a flexible condition-dependent strategy that allows individuals to mitigate effects of adverse conditions. consequently, te rates ought to be highly variable, but sources of variations are poorly understood for most species. we used data from known-aged female weddell seals (leptonychotes weddellii) tagged in erebus bay, antarctica, to investigate sources of variation in te rates prior to reproduction and to evaluate possible implications for age-specific probability of first reproduction. te rates were near 1 the year after birth, decreased to an average of 0.15 ( = 0.01) by age 8, and were similar thereafter. te rates varied substantially from year-to-year and were lower for seals that attended reproductive colonies the previous year than for seals that did not attend (e.g., = 0.22). recruitment rates were marginally greater for seals that did attend than for seals that did not attend colonies the previous year. for weddell seals specifically, our results suggest that (1) motivation to attend colonies varied temporally, (2) as seals grew older they had increased motivation to attend even before reproductive maturity, and (3) seals appear to follow various attendance strategies. more broadly, our results support the idea of te as a variable, condition-dependent strategy, and highlight the utility of te models for providing population and life-history insights for diverse taxa."
bear historical ranges revisited: documenting the increase of a once-extirpated population in nevada,black bear; extirpated population; historical records; nevada; population estimation; ursus americanus,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,LACKEY CW;BECKMANN JP;SEDINGER J,"black bears (ursus americanus) were once abundant in nevada and distributed throughout the state, yet recognition of the species' historical occurrence in the state is uncommon and has therefore been ignored in published distribution maps for north america. the lack of representation on distribution maps is likely due to the lack of any scientific data or research on bears in nevada until 1987. historical records dating back to the 1840s compiled by nevada department of wildlife (ndow) biologist robert mcquivey indicate presence of black bears throughout the state in the 1800s through about 1930. the paucity of historical references after 1931 suggest extirpation of black bears from nevada's interior mountain ranges by this time. we report on historical records of black bears in the state of nevada and the results of a current population estimate of black bears derived from a sample of marked bears (n=420) captured 707 times between 1997 and 2008. using pradel and cormackjollyseber models in program mark, we estimated overall population size, finite rate of growth (=1.16), quarterly and annual survival rates for males and females, seasonal capture probabilities, and recruitment rates. our results indicate an overall population size of 262 +/- 31 adult black bears in western nevada. these results suggest that the once abundant, then extirpated population of black bears in nevada is increasing at an annual average rate of 16%. although the current distribution is limited to the western part of the state, our findings suggest possible expansion of the population into historical habitat within the interior and eastern portions of the state that have been absent of bears for >80 years. finally, based on historical records, we present suggested revised historical distribution maps for black bears that include the great basin ranges in nevada.

revisiting the effect of capture heterogeneity on survival estimates in capture-mark-recapture studies: does it matter?,NA,PLOS ONE,ABADI F;BOTHA A;ALTWEGG R,"recently developed capture-mark-recapture methods allow us to account for capture heterogeneity among individuals in the form of discrete mixtures and continuous individual random effects. in this article, we used simulations and two case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of continuously distributed individual random effects at removing potential bias due to capture heterogeneity, and to evaluate in what situation the added complexity of these models is justified. simulations and case studies showed that ignoring individual capture heterogeneity generally led to a small negative bias in survival estimates and that individual random effects effectively removed this bias. as expected, accounting for capture heterogeneity also led to slightly less precise survival estimates. our case studies also showed that accounting for capture heterogeneity increased in importance towards the end of study. though ignoring capture heterogeneity led to a small bias in survival estimates, such bias may greatly impact management decisions. we advocate reducing potential heterogeneity at the sampling design stage. where this is insufficient, we recommend modelling individual capture heterogeneity in situations such as when a large proportion of the individuals has a low detection probability (e.g. in the presence of floaters) and situations where the most recent survival estimates are of great interest (e.g. in applied conservation)."
accounting for imperfect detection is critical for inferring marine turtle nesting population trends,NA,PLOS ONE,PFALLER JB;BJORNDAL KA;CHALOUPKA M;WILLIAMS KL;FRICK MG;BOLTEN AB,"assessments of population trends based on time-series counts of individuals are complicated by imperfect detection, which can lead to serious misinterpretations of data. population trends of threatened marine turtles worldwide are usually based on counts of nests or nesting females. we analyze 39 years of nest-count, female-count, and capture-mark-recapture (cmr) data for nesting loggerhead turtles (caretta caretta) on wassaw island, georgia, usa. annual counts of nests and females, not corrected for imperfect detection, yield significant, positive trends in abundance. however, multistate open robust design modeling of cmr data that accounts for changes in imperfect detection reveals that the annual abundance of nesting females has remained essentially constant over the 39-year period. the dichotomy could result from improvements in surveys or increased within-season nest-site fidelity in females, either of which would increase detection probability. for the first time in a marine turtle population, we compare results of population trend analyses that do and do not account for imperfect detection and demonstrate the potential for erroneous conclusions. past assessments of marine turtle population trends based exclusively on count data should be interpreted with caution and re-evaluated when possible. these concerns apply equally to population assessments of all species with imperfect detection."
"accounting for age uncertainty in growth modeling, the case study of yellowfin tuna (thunnus albacares) of the indian ocean",NA,PLOS ONE,DORTEL E;MASSIOT GRANIER F;RIVOT E;MILLION J;HALLIER JP;MORIZE E;MUNARON JM;BOUSQUET N;CHASSOT E,"age estimates, typically determined by counting periodic growth increments in calcified structures of vertebrates, are the basis of population dynamics models used for managing exploited or threatened species. in fisheries research, the use of otolith growth rings as an indicator of fish age has increased considerably in recent decades. however, otolith readings include various sources of uncertainty. current ageing methods, which converts an average count of rings into age, only provide periodic age estimates in which the range of uncertainty is fully ignored. in this study, we describe a hierarchical model for estimating individual ages from repeated otolith readings. the model was developed within a bayesian framework to explicitly represent the sources of uncertainty associated with age estimation, to allow for individual variations and to include knowledge on parameters from expertise. the performance of the proposed model was examined through simulations, and then it was coupled to a two-stanza somatic growth model to evaluate the impact of the age estimation method on the age composition of commercial fisheries catches. we illustrate our approach using the saggital otoliths of yellowfin tuna of the indian ocean collected through large-scale mark-recapture experiments. the simulation performance suggested that the ageing error model was able to estimate the ageing biases and provide accurate age estimates, regardless of the age of the fish. coupled with the growth model, this approach appeared suitable for modeling the growth of indian ocean yellowfin and is consistent with findings of previous studies. the simulations showed that the choice of the ageing method can strongly affect growth estimates with subsequent implications for age-structured data used as inputs for population models. finally, our modeling approach revealed particularly useful to reflect uncertainty around age estimates into the process of growth estimation and it can be applied to any study relying on age estimation."
fisheries bycatch as an inadvertent human-induced evolutionary mechanism,NA,PLOS ONE,BARBRAUD C;TUCK GN;THOMSON R;DELORD K;WEIMERSKIRCH H,"selective harvesting of animals by humans can affect the sustainability and genetics of their wild populations. bycatch - the accidental catch of non-target species - spans the spectrum of marine fauna and constitutes a harvesting pressure. individual differences in attraction to fishing vessels and consequent susceptibility to bycatch exist, but few studies integrate this individual heterogeneity with demography. here, we tested for the evidence and consequences of individual heterogeneity on the demography of the wandering albatross, a seabird heavily affected by fisheries bycatch. we found strong evidence for heterogeneity in survival with one group of individuals having a 5.2% lower annual survival probability than another group, and a decrease in the proportion of those individuals with the lowest survival in the population coinciding with a 7.5 fold increase in fishing effort in the foraging areas. potential causes for the heterogeneity in survival are discussed and we suggest that bycatch removed a large proportion of individuals attracted by fishing vessels and had significant phenotypic and population consequences."
multiple weather factors affect apparent survival of european passerine birds,NA,PLOS ONE,SALEWSKI V;HOCHACHKA WM;FIEDLER W,"weather affects the demography of animals and thus climate change will cause local changes in demographic rates. in birds numerous studies have correlated demographic factors with weather but few of those examined variation in the impacts of weather in different seasons and, in the case of migrants, in different regions. using capture-recapture models we correlated weather with apparent survival of seven passerine bird species with different migration strategies to assess the importance of selected facets of weather throughout the year on apparent survival. contrary to our expectations weather experienced during the breeding season did not affect apparent survival of the target species. however, measures for winter severity were associated with apparent survival of a resident species, two short-distance/partial migrants and a long-distance migrant. apparent survival of two short distance migrants as well as two long-distance migrants was further correlated with conditions experienced during the non-breeding season in spain. conditions in africa had statistically significant but relatively minor effects on the apparent survival of the two long-distance migrants but also of a presumably short-distance migrant and a short-distance/partial migrant. in general several weather effects independently explained similar amounts of variation in apparent survival for the majority of species and single factors explained only relatively low amounts of temporal variation of apparent survival. although the directions of the effects on apparent survival mostly met our expectations and there are clear predictions for effects of future climate we caution against simple extrapolations of present conditions to predict future population dynamics. not only did weather explains limited amounts of variation in apparent survival, but future demographics will likely be affected by changing interspecific interactions, opposing effects of weather in different seasons, and the potential for phenotypic and microevolutionary adaptations."

pacific halibut on the move: a renewed understanding of adult migration from a coastwide tagging study,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,WEBSTER RA;CLARK WG;LEAMAN BM;FORSBERG JE,"results of a coastwide tagging study show that ontogenetic migration of pacific halibut (hippoglossus stenolepis) continues for larger fish, whereas in recent years the assumption had been that only smaller, younger fish migrated. in 2003-2004, a total of 67 000 pacific halibut tagged with passive integrated transponder tags were released by the international pacific halibut commission (iphc) from oregon to the bering sea. portside scanning recovered over 3000 of these tags. models were fitted that allowed commercial fishing mortality to be a function of fish length, year, and iphc regulatory area, while migration probability was a function of area and length. estimates from the models support the view that exploitation rates were much higher in eastern than western areas prior to the reduction of quotas following new results from a coastwide stock assessment in 2007. we explore possible explanations for differences between tagging and iphc stock assessment results and note that this research provides confirmation of historical inferences regarding patterns of halibut migration based on conventional tagging."

using auxiliary telemetry information to estimate animal density from capture-recapture data,density; geographic closure; mark-recapture; telemetry,ECOLOGY,IVAN JS;WHITE GC;SHENK TM,"estimation of animal density is fundamental to ecology, and ecologists often pursue density estimates using grids of detectors (e.g., cameras, live traps, hair snags) to sample animals at a study site. however, under such a framework, reliable estimates can be difficult to obtain because animals move on and off of the site during the sampling session (i.e., the site is not closed geographically). generally, practitioners address lack of geographic closure by inflating the area sampled by the detectors based on the mean distance individuals moved between trapping events or invoking hierarchical models in which animal density is assumed to be a spatial point process, and detection is modeled as a declining function of distance to a detector. we provide an alternative in which lack of geographic closure is sampled directly using telemetry, and this auxiliary information is used to compute estimates of density based on a modified huggins closed-capture estimator. contrary to other approaches, this method is free from assumptions regarding the distribution and movement of animals on the landscape, the stationarity of their home ranges, and biases induced by abnormal movements in response to baited detectors. the estimator is freely available in program mark."
using simulation to compare methods for estimating density from capture-recapture data,closure; density; geographic closure; mean maximum distance moved; simulation; spatially explicit capture-recapture; telemetry; trapping grid,ECOLOGY,IVAN JS;WHITE GC;SHENK TM,"estimation of animal density is fundamental to wildlife research and management, but estimation via mark-recapture is often complicated by lack of geographic closure of study sites. contemporary methods for estimating density using mark-recapture data include (1) approximating the effective area sampled by an array of detectors based on the mean maximum distance moved (mmdm) by animals during the sampling session, (2) spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) methods that formulate the problem hierarchically with a process model for animal density and an observation model in which detection probability declines with distance from a detector, and (3) a telemetry estimator (telem) that uses auxiliary telemetry information to estimate the proportion of animals on the study site. we used simulation to compare relative performance (percent error) of these methods under all combinations of three levels of detection probability (0.2, 0.4, 0.6), three levels of occasions (5, 7, 10), and three levels of abundance (10, 20, 40 animals). we also tested each estimator using five different models for animal home ranges. telem performed best across most combinations of capture probabilities, sampling occasions, true densities, and home range configurations, and performance was unaffected by home range shape. secr outperformed mmdm estimators in nearly all comparisons and may be preferable to telem at low capture probabilities, but performance varied with home range configuration. mmdm estimators exhibited substantial positive bias for most simulations, but performance improved for elongated or infinite home ranges."
effects of chemical immobilization on the movement rates of free-ranging polar bears,anesthesia; canadian arctic; capture effects; polar bears; remote drug delivery; satellite telemetry; telazol; tiletamine; ursus maritimus; zolazepam,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,THIEMANN GW;DEROCHER AE;CHERRY SG;LUNN NJ;PEACOCK E;SAHANATIEN V,"the capture and handling of free-ranging animals is an important tool for wildlife research, conservation, and management. however, live capture may expose individual animals to risk of injury, impairment, or mortality. the polar bear (ursus maritimus) is a species of conservation concern throughout its range and physical mark-recapture techniques have formed the basis of polar bear research and harvest management for decades. we examined movement patterns of polar bears postcapture to measure their recovery from chemical immobilization and determine whether captured bears experienced prolonged effects that would affect individual fitness. adult female (n = 61) and juvenile (n = 13) polar bears in 3 canadian subpopulations were captured during the course of other studies using a combination of tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam hydrochloride delivered via remote injection from a helicopter. bears were fitted with satellite-linked global positioning system collars and we used 3 individual-based metrics to assess their recovery from immobilization: time to move 50 m; time to move 100 m; and time to reach a baseline movement rate threshold (km/day) derived from each individual's movements in a fully recovered state (i.e., 30-60 days postcapture). there were no differences in recovery rate metrics across years, age classes, or between females with cubs of different ages. when compared across subpopulations, only the time to move 50 m differed, being shortest in the southern beaufort sea. bears captured on land during the ice-free period in western hudson bay and foxe basin were more variable in their response to capture than were those handled on the sea ice of the beaufort sea, but in all 3 areas, bears showed gradual increases in movement rates. movement rates indicative of recovery were often reached 48 h after capture and 51 (69%) of 74 bears appeared to be fully recovered in <= 3 days. consistent with preliminary work on chemical immobilization of polar bears, there was no relationship between drug dose and rate of recovery. our results indicated that polar bears captured in different locations, seasons, and life-history stages recovered predictably from chemical immobilization in a time frame that is unlikely to affect individual fitness."

when celibacy matters: incorporating non-breeders improves demographic parameter estimates,NA,PLOS ONE,PARDO D;WEIMERSKIRCH H;BARBRAUD C,"in long-lived species only a fraction of a population breeds at a given time. non-breeders can represent more than half of adult individuals, calling in doubt the relevance of estimating demographic parameters from the sole breeders. here we demonstrate the importance of considering observable non-breeders to estimate reliable demographic traits: survival, return, breeding, hatching and fledging probabilities. we study the long-lived quasi-biennial breeding wandering albatross (diomedea exulans). in this species, the breeding cycle lasts almost a year and birds that succeed a given year tend to skip the next breeding occasion while birds that fail tend to breed again the following year. most non-breeders remain unobservable at sea, but still a substantial number of observable non-breeders (onb) was identified on breeding sites. using multi-state capture-mark-recapture analyses, we used several measures to compare the performance of demographic estimates between models incorporating or ignoring onb: bias (difference in mean), precision (difference is standard deviation) and accuracy (both differences in mean and standard deviation). our results highlight that ignoring onb leads to bias and loss of accuracy on breeding probability and survival estimates. these effects are even stronger when studied in an age-dependent framework. biases on breeding probabilities and survival increased with age leading to overestimation of survival at old age and thus actuarial senescence and underestimation of reproductive senescence. we believe our study sheds new light on the difficulties of estimating demographic parameters in species/taxa where a significant part of the population does not breed every year. taking into account onb appeared important to improve demographic parameter estimates, models of population dynamics and evolutionary conclusions regarding senescence within and across taxa."

effects of culling on mesopredator population dynamics,NA,PLOS ONE,BEASLEY JC;OLSON ZH;BEATTY WS;DHARMARAJAN G;RHODES OE,"anthropogenic changes in land use and the extirpation of apex predators have facilitated explosive growth of mesopredator populations. consequently, many species have been subjected to extensive control throughout portions of their range due to their integral role as generalist predators and reservoirs of zoonotic disease. yet, few studies have monitored the effects of landscape composition or configuration on the demographic or behavioral response of mesopredators to population manipulation. during 2007 we removed 382 raccoons (procyon lotor) from 30 forest patches throughout a fragmented agricultural ecosystem to test hypotheses regarding the effects of habitat isolation on population recovery and role of range expansion and dispersal in patch colonization of mesopredators in heterogeneous landscapes. patches were allowed to recolonize naturally and demographic restructuring of patches was monitored from 2008-2010 using mark-recapture. an additional 25 control patches were monitored as a baseline measure of demography. after 3 years only 40% of experimental patches had returned to pre-removal densities. this stagnant recovery was driven by low colonization rates of females, resulting in little to no within-patch recruitment. colonizing raccoons were predominantly young males, suggesting that dispersal, rather than range expansion, was the primary mechanism driving population recovery. contrary to our prediction, neither landscape connectivity nor measured local habitat attributes influenced colonization rates, likely due to the high dispersal capability of raccoons and limited role of range expansion in patch colonization. although culling is commonly used to control local populations of many mesopredators, we demonstrate that such practices create severe disruptions in population demography that may be counterproductive to disease management in fragmented landscapes due to an influx of dispersing males into depopulated areas. however, given the slow repopulation rates observed in our study, localized depopulation may be effective at reducing negative ecological impacts of mesopredators in fragmented landscapes at limited spatial and temporal scales."
population recovery following decline in an endangered stream-breeding frog (mixophyes fleayi) from subtropical australia,NA,PLOS ONE,NEWELL DA;GOLDINGAY RL;BROOKS LO,"amphibians have undergone dramatic declines and extinctions worldwide. prominent among these have been the stream-breeding frogs in the rainforests of eastern australia. the amphibian chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd) has been postulated as the primary cause of these declines. we conducted a capture-mark-recapture study over a 7-year period on the endangered fleay's barred frog (mixophyes fleayi) at two independent streams (30 km apart) in order to assess the stability of these populations. this species had undergone a severe decline across its narrow geographic range. mark-recapture modelling showed that the number of individuals increased 3-10 fold along stream transects over this period. frog detection probabilities were frequently above 50% but declined as the populations increased. adult survival was important to overall population persistence in light of low recruitment events, suggesting that longevity may be a key factor in this recovery. one male and female were present in the capture record for >6 years. this study provides an unambiguous example of population recovery in the presence of bd."
mate-searching behaviour of common and rare wasps and the implications for pollen movement of the sexually deceptive orchids they pollinate,NA,PLOS ONE,MENZ MHM;PHILLIPS RD;DIXON KW;PEAKALL R;DIDHAM RK,"pollinator behaviour directly affects patterns of pollen movement and outcrossing rates in plants. in orchids pollinated by sexual deception of insects, patterns of pollen movement are primarily determined by the mate-searching behaviour of the deceived males. here, using a capture-mark-recapture study (cmr) and dietary analysis, we compare mate-searching behaviour in relation to local abundance of two pollinator species and explore the implications for pollen movement in sexually deceptive drakaea (orchidaceae). drakaea are pollinated solely by the sexual deception of male thynnine wasps. the rare drakaea elastica and widespread d. livida occur sympatrically and are pollinated by the rare but locally common zaspilothynnus gilesi, and the widespread and abundant z. nigripes, respectively. local abundance was significantly different with z. nigripes twice as abundant as z. gilesi. for the 653 marked wasps, there was no significant difference in median movement distance between z. gilesi and z. nigripes. however, the maximum movement distance was twice as high for z. gilesi (556 m) compared with z. nigripes (267 m). this is up to three times greater than previously reported for thynnines in cmr studies. recapture rates were six times higher in z. gilesi (57%) compared to z. nigripes (9%). pollen loads and wasp longevity were similar, suggesting that this difference in recapture rate arises due to differences in the number of males moving at a scale >500 m rather than through diet or mortality. differences in the frequency of longer movements may arise due to variation in the spatial distribution of the wingless females. we predict that pollen movement will largely be restricted to within populations of drakaea (<500 m), with few movements between populations (>500 m)."
big cats in our backyards: persistence of large carnivores in a human dominated landscape in india,NA,PLOS ONE,ATHREYA V;ODDEN M;LINNELL JDC;KRISHNASWAMY J;KARANTH U,"protected areas are extremely important for the long term viability of biodiversity in a densely populated country like india where land is a scarce resource. however, protected areas cover only 5% of the land area in india and in the case of large carnivores that range widely, human use landscapes will function as important habitats required for gene flow to occur between protected areas. in this study, we used photographic capture recapture analysis to assess the density of large carnivores in a human-dominated agricultural landscape with density >300 people/km(2) in western maharashtra, india. we found evidence of a wide suite of wild carnivores inhabiting a cropland landscape devoid of wilderness and wild herbivore prey. furthermore, the large carnivores; leopard (panthera pardus) and striped hyaena (hyaena hyaena) occurred at relatively high density of 4.8 +/- 1.2 (sd) adults/100 km(2) and 5.03 +/- 1.3 (sd) adults/100 km(2) respectively. this situation has never been reported before where 10 large carnivores/100 km(2) are sharing space with dense human populations in a completely modified landscape. human attacks by leopards were rare despite a potentially volatile situation considering that the leopard has been involved in serious conflict, including human deaths in adjoining areas. the results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both, humans and wildlife to each other's presence. the results also highlight the urgent need to shift from a pa centric to a landscape level conservation approach, where issues are more complex, and the potential for conflict is also very high. it also highlights the need for a serious rethink of conservation policy, law and practice where the current management focus is restricted to wildlife inside protected areas."
recapture heterogeneity in cliff swallows: increased exposure to mist nets leads to net avoidance,NA,PLOS ONE,ROCHE EA;BROWN CR;BROWN MB;LEAR KM,"ecologists often use mark-recapture to estimate demographic variables such as abundance, growth rate, or survival for samples of wild animal populations. a common assumption underlying mark-recapture is that all animals have an equal probability of detection, and failure to meet or correct for this assumption-as when certain members of the population are either easier or more difficult to capture than other animals-can lead to biased and inaccurate demographic estimates. we built within-year and among-years cormack-jolly-seber recaptures-only models to identify causes of capture heterogeneity for a population of colonially nesting cliff swallows (petrochelidon pyrrhonota) caught using mist-netting as a part of a 20-year mark-recapture study in southwestern nebraska, u. s. a. daily detection of cliff swallows caught in stationary mist nets at their colony sites declined as the birds got older and as the frequency of netting at a site within a season increased. experienced birds' avoidance of the net could be countered by sudden disturbances that startled them into a net, such as when we dropped a net over the side of a bridge or flushed nesting cliff swallows into a stationary net positioned at a colony entrance. our results support the widely held, but seldom tested, belief that birds learn to avoid stationary mist nets over time, but also show that modifications of traditional field methods can reduce this source of recapture heterogeneity."

estimating jaguar densities with camera traps: problems with current designs and recommendations for future studies,spatially explicit capture recapture model (secr); panthera onca; density estimation; mean maximum distance moved (mmdm); simulation; camera traps,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,TOBLER MW;POWELL GVN,"camera traps have become the main method for estimating jaguar (panthera onca) densities. over 74 studies have been carried out throughout the species range following standard design recommendations. we reviewed the study designs used by these studies and the results obtained. using simulated data we evaluated the performance of different statistical methods for estimating density from camera trap data including the closed-population capture-recapture models m-o and m-h with a buffer of 1/2 and the full mean maximum distance moved (mmdm) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) models under different study designs and scenarios. we found that for the studies reviewed density estimates were negatively correlated with camera polygon size and mmdm estimates were positively correlated. the simulations showed that for camera polygons that were smaller than approximately one home range density estimates for all methods had a positive bias. for large polygons the mh mmdm and secr model produced the most accurate results and elongated polygons can improve estimates with the secr model. when encounter rates and home range sizes varied by sex, estimates had a negative bias for models that did not include sex as a covariate. based on the simulations we concluded that the majority of jaguar camera trap studies did not meet the requirements necessary to produce unbiased density estimates and likely overestimated true densities. we make clear recommendations for future study designs with respect to camera layout, number of cameras, study length, and camera placement. our findings directly apply to camera trap studies of other large carnivores.

catchability model selection for estimating the composition of fishes and invertebrates within dynamic aquatic ecosystems,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,LAURETTA MV;CAMP EV;PINE WE;FRAZER TK,"we evaluated alternative catchability models for estimating the composition of fishes and decapods in two coastal rivers sampled via capture-recapture boat electrofishing, seine removal sampling, and throw trap removal sampling. information criteria were used to select between linear and nonlinear catchability models and assess heterogeneity in catchability coefficients across populations, sampling reaches, and sampling events. the selected electrofishing catchability model assumed linearity between catch per unit effort and population density, with heterogeneity in catchability coefficients among taxa and between rivers. linear models were selected for seine and throw trap samples, with heterogeneity in catchability coefficients among taxa, sampling reaches, and sampling events. we emphasize the importance of estimating population density, rather than abundance exclusively, when accurate community composition estimates are needed. the analytical techniques employed have broad-scale application in quantifying key components of ecosystems by integrating information from multiple sampling gears targeting different taxa or trophic guilds and in accounting for variable sampling intensity and catchability heterogeneity in the estimation of community composition."

ice-dependent winter survival of juvenile atlantic salmon,apparent survival; energy content; ice cover; salmo salar; size-dependent mortality,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,HEDGER RD;NAESJE TF;FISKE P;UGEDAL O;FINSTAD AG;THORSTAD EB,"changes in snow and ice conditions are some of the most distinctive impacts of global warming in cold temperate and arctic regions, altering the environment during a critical period for survival for most animals. laboratories studies have suggested that reduced ice cover may reduce the survival of stream dwelling fishes in northern environments. this, however, has not been empirically investigated in natural populations in large rivers. here, we examine how the winter survival of juvenile atlantic salmon in a large natural river, the river alta (norway, 70 degrees n), is affected by the presence or absence of surface ice. apparent survival rates for size classes corresponding to parr and presmolts were estimated using capture-mark-recapture and cormack-jolly-seber models for an ice-covered and an ice-free site. apparent survival (phi) in the ice-covered site was greater than in the ice-free site, but did not depend on size class (0.64 for both parr and presmolt). in contrast, apparent survival in the ice-free site was lower for larger individuals (0.33) than smaller individuals (0.45). the over-winter decline in storage energy was greater for the ice-free site than the ice-covered site, suggesting that environmental conditions in the ice-free site caused a strong depletion in energy reserves likely affecting survival. our findings highlight the importance of surface ice for the winter survival of juvenile fish, thus, underpinning that climate change, by reducing ice cover, may have a negative effect on the survival of fish adapted to ice-covered habitats during winter."
age and growth of anglerfish (lophius piscatorius) in faroese waters,lophius piscatorius; age; growth; illicia; tagging,FISHERIES RESEARCH,OFSTAD LH;ANGUS C;PEDERSEN T;STEINGRUND P,"to investigate the reliability of age-length growth estimates of anglerfish lophius piscatorius in faroese waters, results from illicia age determination, length frequency and mark-recapture analyses were compared. features of the illicium, such as the time of deposition and sizes of the benthic and first annual zones, width and the marginal increment progression of the edge were studied in detail. results showed that the average horizontal diameters of the benthic and first annual zones were 0.18 mm (age 0) and 0.32 mm (age 1), respectively, and these zones could be identified in anglerfish of any length. there was a strong positive correlation between illicium width and fish length. in transmitted light the edge was usually dark in the winter and light in the summer, and the transition between them took place in may/june. results from illicia age-readings and length-frequency analysis show that anglerfish in these waters have a very high growth rate during their first years of life (age 0-1, 18.5 cm year(-1)), after which smaller individuals grow faster than larger fish. growth rates of fish larger than 35 cm in length are comparable to the fastest growth rates in other areas of the north atlantic. since the illicia age determinations resulted in growth rates that were consistent with length frequency and mark-recapture analyses, we believe that illicia derived age length keys could be used in age-based assessment of anglerfish in faroese waters.

risky business or simple solution - relative abundance indices from camera-trapping,density estimation; detection bias; medium to large sized mammals; individual identification; population monitoring,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,SOLLMANN R;MOHAMED A;SAMEJIMA H;WILTING A,"camera-traps are a widely applied to monitor wildlife populations. for individually marked species, capture-recapture models provide robust population estimates, but for unmarked species, inference is often based on relative abundance indices (rai, number of records per trap effort), although these do not account for imperfect and variable detection. we use a simulation study and empirical camera-trapping data to illustrate how ecological and sampling-related factors can bias rais. our simulations showed that (1) differences in detection between species led to bias in rat ratios toward the more detectable species, especially at low detection levels, (2) species with larger home ranges were photographed more often, inflating rais, (3) species specific responses to different types of trap setup biased rat ratios, and (4) changes in detection over time blurred true population trends inferred from rais. empirical data for leopard cats prionailurus bengalensis and common palm civets paradoxurus hermaphroditus showed that traps set up along roads led to higher rais than off-road traps, but targeting roads increased detection more for leopard cats than for common palm civets. comparing rais of sunda clouded leopards neofelis diardi and leopard cats with spatial capture-recapture based density estimates across sites, rais did not reflect differences in density. analytical options for estimating density from camera-trapping data of unmarked populations are limited. consequently, we fear that rais will continue to be applied. this is alarming, since these measures often form the basis for conservation and management decisions. we suggest considering alternative analytical and survey methods, especially when dealing with threatened species.

"sex-specific correlations of individual heterozygosity, parasite load, and scalation asymmetry in a sexually dichromatic lizard",NA,PLOS ONE,SHANER PJL;CHEN YR;LIN JW;KOLBE JJ;LIN SM,"heterozygosity-fitness correlations (hfcs) provide insights into the genetic bases of individual fitness variation in natural populations. however, despite decades of study, the biological significance of hfcs is still under debate. in this study, we investigated hfcs in a large population of the sexually dimorphic lizard takydromus viridipunctatus (lacertidae). because of the high prevalence of parasitism from trombiculid mites in this lizard, we expect individual fitness (i.e., survival) to decrease with increasing parasite load. furthermore, because morphological asymmetry is likely to influence individuals' mobility (i.e., limb asymmetry) and male biting ability during copulation (i.e., head asymmetry) in this species, we also hypothesize that individual fitness should decrease with increasing morphological asymmetry. although we did not formally test the relationship between morphological asymmetry and fitness in this lizard, we demonstrated that survival decreased with increasing parasite load using a capture-mark-recapture data set. we used a separate sample of 140 lizards to test the correlations between individual heterozygosity (i.e., standardized mean d(2) and hl based on 10 microsatellite loci) and the two fitness traits (i.e., parasite load and morphological asymmetry). we also evaluated and excluded the possibility that single-locus effects produced spurious hfcs. our results suggest male-only, negative correlations between individual heterozygosity and parasite load and between individual heterozygosity and asymmetry, suggesting sex-specific, positive hfcs. male t. viridipunctatus with higher heterozygosity tend to have lower parasite loads (i.e., higher survival) and lower asymmetry, providing a rare example of hfc in reptiles."
photographic capture-recapture sampling for assessing populations of the indian gliding lizard draco dussumieri,NA,PLOS ONE,SREEKAR R;PURUSHOTHAM CB;SAINI K;RAO SN;PELLETIER S;CHAPLOD S,"the usage of invasive tagging methods to assess lizard populations has often been criticised, due to the potential negative effects of marking, which possibly cause increased mortality or altered behaviour. the development of safe, less invasive techniques is essential for improved ecological study and conservation of lizard populations. in this study, we describe a photographic capture-recapture (cr) technique for estimating draco dussumieri (agamidae) populations. we used photographs of the ventral surface of the patagium to identify individuals. to establish that the naturally occurring blotches remained constant through time, we compared capture and recapture photographs of 45 pen-marked individuals after a 30 day interval. no changes in blotches were observed and individual lizards could be identified with 100% accuracy. the population density of d. dussumieri in a two hectare areca-nut plantation was estimated using the cr technique with ten sampling occasions over a ten day period. the resulting recapture histories for 24 individuals were analysed using population models in the program capture. all models indicated that nearly all individuals were captured. the estimated probability for capturing d. dussumieri on at least one occasion was 0.92 and the estimated population density was 13 +/- 1.65 lizards/ha. our results demonstrate the potential for applying cr to population studies in gliding lizards (draco spp.) and other species with distinctive markings."
juvenile survival in a neotropical migratory songbird is lower than expected,NA,PLOS ONE,MCKIM LOUDER MI;HOOVER JP;BENSON TJ;SCHELSKY WM,"attempts to estimate and identify factors influencing first-year survival in passerines, survival between fledging and the first reproductive attempt (i.e. juvenile survival), have largely been confounded by natal dispersal, particularly in long-distance migratory passerines. we studied prothonotary warblers (protonotaria citrea) breeding in nest boxes to estimate first-year survival while accounting for biases related to dispersal that are common in mark-recapture studies. the natal dispersal distribution (median = 1420 m; n = 429) and a distance-dependent recruitment rate, which controls for effects of study site configuration, both indicated a pattern of short-distance natal dispersal. this pattern was consistent with results of a systematic survey for birds returning outside the nest box study sites (up to 30 km in all directions) within a majority (81%) of total available bottomland forest habitat, further suggesting that permanent emigration outside of the study system was rare. we used multistate mark-recapture modeling to estimate first-year survival and incorporated factors thought to influence survival while accounting for the potential confounding effects of dispersal on recapture probabilities for warblers that fledged during 2004-2009 (n = 6093). overall, the average first-year survival for warblers reared without cowbird nestmates was 0.11 (95% ci = 0.09-0.13), decreased with fledging date (0.22 early to 0.03 late) and averaged 40% lower for warblers reared with a brood parasite nestmate. first-year survival was less than half of the rate thought to represent population replacement in migratory passerines (similar to 0.30). this very low rate suggests that surviving the first year of life for many neotropical migratory species is even more difficult than previously thought, forcing us to rethink estimates used in population models."

spatial capture-recapture models for jointly estimating population density and landscape connectivity,animal movement; ecological distance; landscape connectivity; least-cost path; resistance surface; spatial capture-recapture,ECOLOGY,ROYLE JA;CHANDLER RB;GAZENSKI KD;GRAVES TA,"population size and landscape connectivity are key determinants of population viability, yet no methods exist for simultaneously estimating density and connectivity parameters. recently developed spatial capture-recapture (scr) models provide a framework for estimating density of animal populations but thus far have not been used to study connectivity. rather, all applications of scr models have used encounter probability models based on the euclidean distance between traps and animal activity centers, which implies that home ranges are stationary, symmetric, and unaffected by landscape structure. in this paper we devise encounter probability models based on ""ecological distance,"" i.e., the least-cost path between traps and activity centers, which is a function of both euclidean distance and animal movement behavior in resistant landscapes. we integrate least-cost path models into a likelihood-based estimation scheme for spatial capture-recapture models in order to estimate population density and parameters of the least-cost encounter probability model. therefore, it is possible to make explicit inferences about animal density, distribution, and landscape connectivity as it relates to animal movement from standard capture-recapture data. furthermore, a simulation study demonstrated that ignoring landscape connectivity can result in negatively biased density estimators under the naive scr model."
density estimations of the eurasian lynx (lynx lynx) in the swiss alps,camera-trapping; density; half mean maximum distance moved (1/2 mmdm); lynx lynx; mean maximum distance moved (mmdm); spatial capture-recapture (scr); switzerland; telemetry,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,PESENTI E;ZIMMERMANN F,"use of photographic capture recapture analyses to estimate abundance of species with distinctive natural marks has become an important tool for monitoring rare or cryptic species, or both. two different methods are available to estimate density: nonspatial capture recapture models where the trap polygon is buffered with the half or full mean maximum distance moved by animals captured at more than 1 trap (1/2 mmdm or mmdm, respectively); or spatial capture recapture (scr) models that explicitly incorporate movement into the model. we used data from radiotracked eurasian lynx (lynx lynx) in the northwestern swiss alps (nwsa) during a low (1.0 lynx/100 km(2)) and a high (1.9-2.1 lynx/100 km(2)) lynx population density to test if lynx space use was density dependent. second, we compared lynx density estimates resulting from these 2 different methods using camera-trapping data collected during winters 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 in the nwsa. our results indicated lynx space use was negatively correlated with density. lynx density estimates in all habitats using mmdm (0.86 and 0.97 lynx/100 km(2) in winters 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively) were significantly lower than scr model estimates, whereas there was no significant difference between scr model (1.47 and 1.38) and 1/2 mmdm (1.37 and 1.51) density estimates. in the nwsa, which currently harbors the most abundant lynx population in switzerland, 1/2 mmdm and scr models provided more realistic lynx density estimates compared to the mmdm, which lies in the lower range of densities. overall, the scr model is preferable because it considers animal movements explicitly and is not biased by an informal estimation of the effective sampling area."

"living with lions: the economics of coexistence in the gir forests, india",NA,PLOS ONE,BANERJEE K;JHALA YV;CHAUHAN KS;DAVE CV,"rarely human communities coexist in harmony with large predators. most often communities suffer due to predation on their stock while large carnivores suffer losses and at times extirpation due to retaliation. we examine the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of asiatic lions (panthera leo persica) and pastoral communities (maldharis) in the gir forests, india. we monitored six maldhari settlements between 2005 and 2007 to quantify seasonal livestock holding, density and losses due to predation and other causes. lion density, estimated by mark recapture, was 15 +/- 0.1 se/100 km(2). livestock density, estimated by total counts, ranged between 25/km(2)-31/km(2) with buffaloes being most abundant. average livestock holding of maldhari families was 33 +/- 3 se. lions predated mostly on unproductive cattle (30%). scat analysis (n = 165), predation events (n = 180) and seven continuous monitoring sessions of 1,798 hours on four radio-collared lions estimated livestock to contribute between 25 to 42% of lions' biomass consumptions, of which only 16% was predated; rest scavenged. with free grazing rights within gir forests, maldharis offset 58 +/- 0.2 se% of annual livestock rearing cost in comparison to non-forest dwelling pastoralists. with government compensation scheme for livestock predation, this profit margin augmented to 76 +/- 0.05 se%. lion density was higher in areas with maldhari livestock in comparison to areas without livestock. thus, the current lifestyles and livestock holdings of maldharis seem to be beneficial to both lions and local pastoralists. we conclude that a combination of strict protection regime for lions, maldharis' traditional reverence towards lions and the livelihood economics permit the delicate balance of lion-maldhari coexistence. indefinite increase in human and livestock population within gir might upset this equilibrium undermining the conservation objectives. we see no end to compensation programs worldwide as they constitute a crucial element needed for human-carnivore coexistence."

role of free-ranging mammals in the deposition of escherichia coli into a texas floodplain,faecal contamination; floodplain; impaired; mammals; water quality,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,PARKER ID;LOPEZ RR;PADIA R;GALLAGHER M;KARTHIKEYAN R;CATHEY JC;SILVY NJ;DAVIS DS,"context. the role of wildlife in faecal pollution of water bodies (deposition of escherichia coli (e. coli)) is not well understood. current water-quality and land-use planning research largely relies on unreliable wildlife data (e. g. poor sourcing of abundance estimates, population density estimates applied to multiple fundamentally different areas, suspect or insufficiently described data collection techniques) aims. our goal for the present research was to investigate deposition of e. coli into a floodplain by free-ranging mammals. objectives of the research were to determine the density of important free-ranging meso-and large mammals in the study area, determine faecal e. coli loads for each species, and evaluate spatial data on species-specific faecal deposition. methods. we conducted our research in south-eastern texas, usa, on two cattle ranches bisected by cedar creek (44-km long). cedar creek has elevated e. coli concentrations. we conducted mark-recapture and mark-resight population density estimates (2008/09) for meso-and large mammals in the study areas. we collected faecal samples from all captured wildlife. we also conducted transects through the study area to determine faecal-deposition patterns. key results. we found that raccoons (procyon lotor), wild pigs (sus scrofa), virginia opossums (didelphis virginiana) and white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) all had substantial faecal e. coli loads and population densities, thus implying an important role in e. coli deposition into the study floodplain. all species were widely distributed through the floodplain. conclusions. free-ranging mammals contribute e. coli to floodplains and potentially affect water quality. we determined that four species commonly found in floodplains throughout north america all contributed e. coli to the study floodplain, thus implying mammal e. coli contributions in many locations and this is potentially important for e. coli management. implications. improved locally specific mammal population estimates and estimates of locally derived e. coli concentration will improve floodplain and water-quality models that often depend on data of various quality. additionally, our analyses demonstrated the need for continued research into the role of wildlife in e. coli deposition."
variance component analysis of body mass in a wild population of deer (odocoileus virginianus): results from two decades of research,age; environment; individual variation; mixed model; phenotype; repeatability; white-tailed deer,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,WEBB SL;GEE KL;DEYOUNG RW;HARJU SM,"context. long-term studies of large, vertebrate mammals using capture-recapture data are scarce, even though long-term ecological studies are requisite to understanding quantitative genetics and evolutionary processes that can be applied as part of management programs. aims. objectives were to (1) partition components of variation in body mass to understand the differential effects of environmental variation on the sexes during ontogeny, to better prescribe habitat-improvement projects, and (2) estimate repeatability to assess potential for selection on body mass. methods. we used a 23-year dataset (1983-2005) of capture-recapture records of wild white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) to estimate components of variance and repeatability of body mass. we used an animal-model approach that employed the use of general linear mixed models and restricted maximum likelihood to adjust for the effects of age (i.e. fixed effect), and to partition the total phenotypic variance into among-individual (i.e. the deer), permanent environmental (i.e. year of birth) and temporary environmental (i.e. year of measurement and residual) effects (all modelled as random effects). key results. we found that body mass increased with age in both sexes, repeatability of body mass was 0.595 for females and 0.716 for males, and among-individual variation was more influential on body mass than were permanent and temporary environmental effects combined. year of birth was more important in males than females, but changed during the course of ontogeny for both sexes. year of measurement did not influence post-rut body mass in males, but did contribute to variation in body mass of females. conclusions. these long-term data offer insights into the sources of variation that influence body mass of deer, which can be used to understand how environmental sources of variation influence phenotypic traits, and for developing management plans and making selection decisions. implications. knowledge of repeatability (as an upper limit to heritability) can be used to make management decisions related to selection, culling and breeding, whereas understanding environmental effects can lead to better management recommendations (e. g. habitat-improvement projects)."
slow recruitment in a red-fox population following poison baiting: a non-invasive mark-recapture analysis,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,BERRY O;TATLER J;HAMILTON N;HILMER S;HITCHEN Y;ALGAR D,"context. optimal management of invasive species should determine the interval between lethal-control operations that will sustain a desired population suppression at minimum cost. this requires an understanding of the species' rate of recruitment following control. these data are difficult to acquire for vertebrate carnivores such as the red fox (vulpes vulpes), which are not readily trapped or observed. aims. to provide a long-term evaluation of the effects of 1080 poison baiting on the abundance and extent of movement of red foxes in a semiarid environment. methods. we used non-invasive dna sampling of fox hairs in semi-arid western australia where the population was subject to two episodes of aerially delivered sodium fluoroacetate (1080) poison baits within 12 months. sampling took place at similar to 45-day intervals and individual foxes were identified by genotyping eight microsatellite dna markers and a gender-specific marker. open-population and spatially explicit mark-recapture models were used to estimate the density, apparent survival and movements of foxes before and following baiting. key results. following a severe reduction in density after baiting, fox density during the ensuing 12 months increased slowly (0.01 foxes km(-2) month(-1)), such that density had only reached 22% of pre-baiting levels similar to 10 months after the initial baiting. moreover, recovery was non-linear as population growth was negligible for 6 months, then exhibited a nine-fold increase 7-9 months after control, coincident with the dispersal of juveniles in autumn. fox movements between recaptures were on average 470% greater after baiting than before, in line with expectations for low-density populations, suggesting that the probability of encountering baits during this period would be higher than before baiting. conclusions. baiting with 1080 poison significantly reduced the density of foxes, and the low density was sustained for more than 6 months. foxes moved significantly further between recaptures after baiting when at low densities. implications. control programs in this region may be carried out at low frequency to suppress fox density to a fraction of unbaited levels. the intensity of follow-up baiting may also be adjusted downwards, to take account of an increased probability of bait encounter in more mobile foxes."

"techniques for optimising long-term, large-scale capture-mark-resighting raptor studies: climb hard, band fast",bird banding; lifetime reproductive success; study design; vid bands,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,HURLEY VG;WHITE JG;COOKE R,"context. efficiency of large-scale capture-mark-recapture (cmr) studies can be improved by developing accurate methods for predicting the window of opportunity in which banding can occur. aims. this research aimed to investigate potential efficiency improvements in a long-term cmr raptor study. the research focussed on: (1) developing selection processes for adopting cmr protocols; (2) testing methods for increasing the number of nestlings successfully banded; and (3) assessing the efficacy of visual identification (vid) bands for collecting re-sight data. methods. ten selection criteria were developed into a robust cmr-technique selection process and used to assess marking techniques commonly applied to birds. optimising banding effort by predicting banding dates using two different techniques a priori and a posteriori were tested against a traditional approach to the timing of banding. the cost (in time) to collect resight data at an active nest site was also measured. key results. the cmr selection criteria and parameters provided a transparent selection process and scored metal vid bands the highest for the study design. this provided individual recognition of marked birds up to the expected life-span of 14 years. both techniques for predicting banding dates improved the proportion of whole clutches banded by 40%. the average time to identify both peregrine falcon adults of a breeding pair wearing vid bands was 30 min. conclusions. the two methods described here for predicting preferred banding dates are of particular value as efficient approaches to banding large numbers of nestlings are key to the success of cmr studies. all of the methods developed in this research can be applied to cmr studies of almost any bird species with a predictable seasonal breeding system. implications. optimisation and cost effectiveness of cmr studies for seasonal breeding birds can be significantly improved by accurately predicting the window of opportunity in which banding of nestlings can be carried out, and also utilising vid colour bands for rapid collection of recapture data."
"importance of getting the numbers right: quantifying the rapid and substantial decline of an abundant marsupial, bettongia penicillata",NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,WAYNE AF;MAXWELL MA;WARD CG;VELLIOS CV;WARD BG;LIDDELOW GL;WILSON I;WAYNE JC;WILLIAMS MR,"context. a reliable measure of population size is fundamental to ecology and conservation but is often difficult to obtain. the woylie, bettongia penicillata, provides an example where 'getting the numbers right' has important implications in verifying and quantifying the recent unexpected, rapid and substantial declines across much of its range. initial estimates prompted a conservation-status upgrade for the species to endangered by the australian government. the present paper constitutes the foundational paper addressing the first steps of a decline diagnosis framework intended to identify the causes of the recent declines. aims. to verify whether the declines in woylie trap-capture rates are representative of population change; better quantify the size of the largest woylie populations; and review what is understood about the ecology of the woylie and identify key knowledge gaps that may be relevant to identifying the causes of the recent declines. methods. monitoring data from live-cage trapping (transects and grids), sandpads, woylie diggings and nest-density surveys and spotlighting were collated. population measures derived from trapping data included capture rates, number of individuals, abundance estimates based on capture-mark-recapture modelling and density using spatially explicit capture-recapture models (secr). key results. the declines in woylie trap-capture rates were verified as real population declines and corresponded closely with other measures of abundance derived from the same trapping data as well as with independent measures. a 95% decline occurred in the largest extant woylie populations (in the upper warren region, western australia) between 2002 and 2008. at a species level, woylies declined similar to 90% (1999-2006), from a peak of similar to 200 000 individuals in 1999. conclusions. an accurate formal conservation status is an important factor in promoting the conservation of a species. it is recommended that the woylie be considered for critically endangered status under the australian epbc act. implications. adequate and effective monitoring of species is critical to detecting and quantifying population changes in a timely manner. having an accurate measure of population size can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of conservation and management efforts."
evidence for an age-dependent influence of environmental variations on a long-lived seabird's life-history traits,black-browed albatross; breeding probability; breeding success; capture-mark-recapture; chick body condition; fisheries bycatch; kerguelen islands; sea surface temperature; senescence; southern oscillation index; survival; thalassarche melanophris,ECOLOGY,PARDO D;BARBRAUD C;AUTHIER M;WEIMERSKIRCH H,"theoretical and empirical studies have highlighted the effects of age on several life-history traits in wild populations. there is also increasing evidence for environmental effects on their demographic traits. however, quantifying how individuals differentially respond to environmental variations according to their age remains a challenge in ecology. in a population of black-browed albatrosses monitored during 43 years, we analyzed how life-history traits varied according to age, and whether individuals of different ages responded in different ways to environmental conditions. to do so, we: (1) examined how age affected seven life-history traits, (2) investigated differences in temporal variance of demographic traits between age classes, and (3) tested for age-dependent effects of climate and fisheries covariates on demographic traits. overall, there was a tendency for traits to improve during the first years of life (5-10 years), to peak and remain stable at middle age (10-30 years), and decline at old ages. at young ages, survival and reproductive parameters increased, except offspring body condition at fledging, suggesting that younger parents had already acquired good foraging capacities. however, they suffered from inexperience in breeding as suggested by their higher breeding failures during incubation. there was evidence for reproductive and actuarial senescence. in particular, breeding success and offspring body condition declined abruptly, suggesting altered foraging capacities of old individuals. middle-aged individuals had the lowest temporal variance of demographic traits. although this is predicted by the theory of environmental canalization, it could also results from a higher susceptibility of young and old birds due to their respective inexperience and senescence. the highest temporal variances were found in old individuals. survival was significantly influenced by sea surface temperatures in the foraging zone of this albatross population during breeding. during warm events survival of young and old individuals improved, whereas a decrease was observed for middle-aged individuals. presumably, during cold years with poor environmental conditions, young and old breeding birds may suffer more from intraspecific competition for resources than middle-aged individuals. this study showed that age, known as a major factor structuring demography in long-lived species, can also potentially influence the response of populations to global change."
the impact of increased food availability on survival of a long-distance migratory bird,"annual survival; climate change; fair isle, uk; food availability; food supplementation experiment; land-use change; migratory birds; northern wheatear; oenanthe oenanthe",ECOLOGY,SEWARD AM;BEALE CM;GILBERT L;JONES TH;THOMAS RJ,"temperature-, rainfall- and habitat-driven change in food availability is one likely mechanism by which anthropogenic factors may affect animal population dynamics and species distributions. long-distance migratory birds must synchronize their migrations with food availability at locations hundreds or thousands of kilometers apart, so changes in the overall abundance of food or the phenology of peaks in food availability may be critical factors influencing annual survival. in this study we used experimental food supplementation at a breeding site to examine and compare the impact of changing food supply on annual survival of adult migratory birds and their offspring. we provided supplemental food to northern wheatears (oenanthe oenanthe) breeding on fair isle, uk, to infer the sensitivity of annual survival to increases in natural food availability. food-supplemented wheatears exhibited higher rates of annual survival than control wheatears, and the strength of this effect varied with age. food supplementation led to 1.56 times higher annual survival of juveniles and 1.22 times higher survival of adults. survival of juveniles was related to their own food availability as fledglings, but not to whether their parents were food-supplemented or unfed control adults. this increased survival, combined with increased breeding productivity associated with food supplementation, implies that an increase in natural food availability, of the magnitude simulated in our experiment, would increase the population growth rate of wheatears on fair isle from approximately lambda - 0.93 (a contracting population) to lambda - 1.14 (an expanding population)."
impacts of introduced european hedgehogs on endemic skinks and weta in tussock grassland,damage function; erinaceus europaeus; experiment; hemiandrus spp.; oligosoma maccanni; o. polychroma; predation,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,JONES C;NORBURY G;BELL T,"context. control of introduced pest species is based on the premise that there is a relationship between pest abundance and impact, but this relationship is rarely defined. aim. we investigated the impacts of introduced european hedgehogs (erinaceus europaeus) on two species of small endemic skink (oligosoma spp.) and flightless, nocturnal endemic orthopteran ground weta (hemiandrus spp.), using an enclosure-based experimental manipulation of hedgehog density in tussock grasslands in the south island of new zealand. methods. we used capture-mark-recapture methods to estimate the densities of skinks before and after exposure to a range of hedgehog densities over a 3-month period and also compared changes in indices of abundance of skink demographic groups and ground weta. key results. faecal analysis confirmed that hedgehogs consumed skinks and invertebrates in the enclosures. the proportional change between capture sessions in numbers of captured juvenile mccann's skinks (o. maccanni) declined with increasing hedgehog density. similarly, the proportional change in the numbers of ground weta encountered in pitfall traps showed a highly significant negative relationship with increasing hedgehog density. total species abundances and numbers in other demographic skink groups did not change significantly in relation to hedgehog density. for overall skink abundance estimates, there was an apparent trend suggesting that changes in abundance were more negative with increasing hedgehog density, but this did not reach statistical significance for either skink species. conclusions. our results confirmed that hedgehogs are important predators of small native fauna, but suggested that highly abundant prey populations may be buffered against significant impacts. implications. less abundant prey and some demographic groups within populations, however, may be at significant risk from hedgehog predation."
contrasting effects of climatic variability on the demography of a trans-equatorial migratory seabird,breeding success; capture-recapture; cory's shearwater; migratory seabird; multi-event modelling; nest dispersal; reproductive skipping; survival; transient,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,GENOVART M;SANZ AGUILAR A;FERNANDEZ CHACON A;IGUAL JM;PRADEL R;FORERO MG;ORO D,"large-scale seasonal climatic indices, such as the north atlantic oscillation (nao) index or the southern oscillation index (soi), account for major variations in weather and climate around the world and may influence population dynamics in many organisms. however, assessing the extent of climate impacts on species and their life-history traits requires reliable quantitative statistical approaches. we used a new analytical tool in markrecapture, the multi-event modelling, to simultaneously assess the influence of climatic variation on multiple demographic parameters (i.e. adult survival, transient probability, reproductive skipping and nest dispersal) at two mediterranean colonies of the cory's shearwater calonectris diomedea, a trans-equatorial migratory long-lived seabird. we also analysed the impact of climate in the breeding success at the two colonies. we found a clear temporal variation of survival for cory's shearwaters, strongly associated to the large-scale soi especially in one of the colonies (up to 66% of variance explained). atlantic hurricane season is modulated by the soi and coincides with shearwater migration to their wintering areas, directly affecting survival probabilities. however, the soi was a better predictor of survival probabilities than the frequency of hurricanes; thus, we cannot discard an indirect additive effect of soi via food availability. accordingly, the proportion of transients was also correlated with soi values, indicating higher costs of first reproduction (resulting in either mortality or permanent dispersal) when bad environmental conditions occurred during winter before reproduction. breeding success was also affected by climatic factors, the nao explaining c. 41% of variance, probably as a result of its effect in the timing of peak abundance of squid and small pelagics, the main prey for shearwaters. no climatic effect was found either on reproductive skipping or on nest dispersal. contrarily to what we expect for a long-lived organism, large-scale climatic indexes had a more pronounced effect on survival and transient probabilities than on less sensitive fitness parameters such reproductive skipping or nest dispersal probabilities. the potential increase in hurricane frequency because of global warming may interact with other global change agents (such as incidental bycatch and predation by alien species) nowadays impacting shearwaters, affecting future viability of populations."
density and genetic structure of black bears in coastal south carolina,american black bear; coastal south carolina; dna sampling; genetic structure; population density; spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr); ursus americanus,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,DREWRY JM;VAN MANEN FT;RUTH DM,"the frequency of black bear (ursus americanus) sightings, vehicle collisions, and nuisance incidents in the coastal region of south carolina has increased over the past 4 decades. to develop the statewide black bear management and conservation strategy, the south carolina department of natural resources needed reliable information for the coastal population. because no such data were available, we initiated a study to determine population density and genetic structure of black bears. we selected 2 study areas that were representative of the major habitat types in the study region: lewis ocean bay consisted primarily of carolina bays and pocosin habitats, whereas carvers bay was representative of extensive pine plantations commonly found in the region. we established hair snares on both study areas to obtain dna from hair samples during 8 weekly sampling periods in 2008 and again in 2009. we used genotypes to obtain capture histories of sampled bears. we estimated density using spatially explicit capturerecapture (secr) models and used information-theoretic procedures to fit parameters for capture heterogeneity and behavioral responses and to test if density and model parameters varied by year. model-averaged density was 0.046?bears/km2 (se?=?0.011) for carvers bay and 0.339?bears/km2 (se?=?0.056) for lewis ocean bay. next, we sampled habitat covariates for all locations in the secr sampling grid to derive spatially explicit estimates of density based on habitat characteristics. addition of habitat covariates had substantial support, and accounted for differences in density between carvers bay and lewis ocean bay; black bear density showed a negative association with the area of pine forests (4.5-km2 scale) and a marginal, positive association with the area of pocosin habitat (0.3-km2 scale). bear density was not associated with pine forest at a smaller scale (0.3-km2), nor with major road density or an index of largest patch size. predicted bear densities were low throughout the coastal region and only a few larger areas had high predicted densities, most of which were centered on public lands (e.g., francis marion national forest, lewis ocean bay). we sampled a third bear population in the green swamp area of north carolina for genetic structure analyses and found no evidence of historic fragmentation among the 3 sampled populations. neither did we find evidence of more recent barriers to gene exchange; with the exception of 1 recent migrant, bayesian population assignment techniques identified only a single population cluster that incorporated all 3 sampled areas. bears in the region may best be managed as 1 population. if the goal is to maintain or increase bear densities, demographic connectivity of high-density areas within the low-density landscape matrix is a key consideration and managers would need to mitigate potential impacts of planned highway expansions and anticipated development. because the distribution of black bears in coastal south carolina is not fully known, the regional map of potential black bear density can be used to identify focal areas for management and sites that should be surveyed for occupancy or where more intensive studies are needed.

detection and plant monitoring programs: lessons from an intensive survey of asclepias meadii with five observers,NA,PLOS ONE,ALEXANDER HM;REED AW;KETTLE WD;SLADE NA;ROELS SAB;COLLINS CD;SALISBURY V,"monitoring programs, where numbers of individuals are followed through time, are central to conservation. although incomplete detection is expected with wildlife surveys, this topic is rarely considered with plants. however, if plants are missed in surveys, raw count data can lead to biased estimates of population abundance and vital rates. to illustrate, we had five independent observers survey patches of the rare plant asclepias meadii at two prairie sites. we analyzed data with two mark-recapture approaches. using the program capture, the estimated number of patches equaled the detected number for a burned site, but exceeded detected numbers by 28% for an unburned site. analyses of detected patches using huggins models revealed important effects of observer, patch state (flowering/nonflowering), and patch size (number of stems) on probabilities of detection. although some results were expected (i.e. greater detection of flowering than nonflowering patches), the importance of our approach is the ability to quantify the magnitude of detection problems. we also evaluated the degree to which increased observer numbers improved detection: smaller groups (3-4 observers) generally found 90 - 99% of the patches found by all five people, but pairs of observers or single observers had high error and detection depended on which individuals were involved. we conclude that an intensive study at the start of a long-term monitoring study provides essential information about probabilities of detection and what factors cause plants to be missed. this information can guide development of monitoring programs. citation: alexander hm, reed aw, kettle wd, slade na, bodbyl roels sa, et al.

breeding experience might be a major determinant of breeding probability in long-lived species: the case of the greater flamingo,NA,PLOS ONE,PRADEL R;CHOQUET R;BECHET A,"the probability of breeding is known to increase with age early in life in many long-lived species. this increase may be due to experience accumulated through past breeding attempts. recent methodological advances allowing accounting for unobserved breeding episodes, we analyzed the encounter histories of 14716 greater flamingos over 25 years to get a detailed picture of the interactions of age and experience. survival did not improve with experience, seemingly ruling out the selection hypothesis. breeding probability varied within three levels of experience : no breeding experience, 1 experience, 2+ experiences. we fitted models with and without among-individual differences in breeding probabilities by including or not an additive individual random effect. including the individual random effect improved the model fit less than including experience but the best model retained both. however, because modeling individual heterogeneity by means of an additive static individual random effect is currently criticized and may not be appropriate, we discuss the results with and without random effect. without random effect, breeding probability of inexperienced birds was always > 3 times lower than that of same age experienced birds, and breeding probability increased more with one additional experience than with one additional year of age. with random effects, the advantage of experience was unequivocal only after age 9 while in young having > 1 experience was penalizing. another pattern, that breeding probability of birds with < 2 experiences dropped after some age (8 without random effect; up to 11 with it), may point to differences in the timing of reproductive senescence or to the existence of a sensitive period for acquiring behavioral skills. overall, the role of experience appears strong in this long-lived species. we argue that overlooking the role of experience may hamper detection of trade-offs and assessment of individual heterogeneity. however, manipulative experiments are desirable to confirm our finding. citation: pradel r, choquet r, bechet a (2012) breeding experience might be a major determinant of breeding probability in long-lived species: the case of the greater flamingo. plos one 7(12): e51016. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051016"
identification of hidden key hepatitis c populations: an evaluation of screening practices using mixed epidemiological methods,NA,PLOS ONE,VERMEIREN APA;DUKERS MUIJRERS NHTM;VAN LOO IHM;STALS F;VAN DAM DW;AMBERGEN T;HOEBE CJPA,"background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) is a major cause of liver diseases worldwide. due to its asymptomatic nature, screening is necessary for identification. because screening of the total population is not cost effective, it is important to identify which risk factors for positivity characterize the key populations in which targeting of screening yields the highest numbers of hcv positives, and assess which of these key populations have remained hidden to current care. methods: laboratory registry data (2002-2008) were retrieved for all hcv tests (23,800) in the south of the netherlands (adult population 500,000). screening trends were tested using poisson regression and chi-square tests. risk factors for hcv positivity were assessed using a logistic regression. the hidden hcv-positive population was estimated by a capture-recapture approach. results: the number of tests increased over time (2,388 to 4,149, p<.01). nevertheless, the positivity rate among those screened decreased between 2002 and 2008 (6.3% to 2.1%, p<.01). the population prevalence was estimated to be 0.49% (95%ci 0.41-0.59). of all hcv-positive patients, 66% were hidden to current screening practices. risk factors associated with positivity were low socio-economic status, male sex, and age between 36-55. in future screening 48% (95%ci 37-63) of total patients and 47% (95%ci 32-70) of hidden patients can be identified by targeting 9% (men with low socio-economic status, between 36-55 years old) of the total population. conclusions: although the current hcv screening policy increasingly addresses high-risk populations, it only reaches one third of positive patients. this study shows that combining easily identifiable demographic risk factors can be used to identify key populations as a likely target for effective hcv screening. we recommend strengthening screening among middle-aged man, living in low socio-economic neighborhoods."

extreme weather and experience influence reproduction in an endangered bird,climate change; cost of reproduction; drought; florida snail kite; mark-recapture; multistate models; population viability; robust design; rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus; state uncertainty,ECOLOGY,REICHERT BE;CATTAU CE;FLETCHER RJ;KENDALL WL;KITCHENS WM,"extreme weather events, such as droughts and heat waves, are expected to become more severe and more frequent in the coming years, and understanding their impacts on demographic rates is of increasing interest to both evolutionary ecologists and conservation practitioners. an individual's breeding probability can be a sensitive indicator of the decision to initiate reproductive behavior under varying environmental conditions, has strong fitness consequences, and can be considered the first step in a life history trade-off between allocating resources for breeding activities or self-survival. using a 14-year time series spanning large variation in climatic conditions and the entirety of a population's breeding range, we estimated the effects of extreme weather conditions (drought) on the state-specific probabilities of breeding and survival of an endangered bird, the florida snail kite (rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). our analysis accounted for uncertainty in breeding status assignment, a common source of uncertainty that is often ignored when states are based on field observations. breeding probabilities in adult kites (> 1 year of age) decreased during droughts, whereas the probability of breeding in young kites (1 year of age) tended to increase. individuals attempting to breed showed no evidence of reduced future survival. although population viability analyses of this species and other species often implicitly assume that all adults will attempt to breed, we find that breeding probabilities were significantly < 1 for all 13 estimable years considered. our results suggest that experience is an important factor determining whether or not individuals attempt to breed during harsh environmental conditions and that reproductive effort may be constrained by an individual's quality and/or despotic behavior among individuals attempting to breed."
carry-over effects of spring hunt and climate on recruitment to the natal colony in a migratory species,arctic; capture-mark-recapture; harvest; multistate model; population management; snow geese,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,JUILLET C;CHOQUET R;GAUTHIER G;LEFEBVRE J;PRADEL R,"in long-lived species, temporal variation in recruitment, defined as the entry of new individuals into the breeding population, can have a large effect on population growth rate. while hunting, as a management tool, is generally expected to control population size via increased mortality, it may also act by affecting recruitment. although the impact of hunting on survival is well studied, less attention has been paid to the non-lethal impacts of hunting on recruitment. to control the population size of the greater snow goose chen caerulescens atlantica, an overabundant arctic-nesting species, a spring hunting season was implemented from 1999 onwards in addition to the traditional autumn and winter hunting seasons. we investigated the potential carry-over effect of spring hunting on recruitment of females to their natal colony on bylot island, nunavut, canada from 1992 to 2005 while accounting for other potential confounding factors, primarily climatic effects. we applied a multistate capture-mark-recapture recruitment model to a dataset of known-age individuals (n = 12 100), combining live recaptures at the breeding colony with dead recoveries from hunters. annual variation in recruitment probability was best explained by spring hunt and a synthetic variable combining the climatic conditions experienced during migration (extreme values of the north atlantic oscillation index) with conditions upon arrival at the breeding grounds (snow cover). this model accounted for 58% of the temporal variation in recruitment, while the harvest rate or the climatic index taken alone accounted for 38% each. in the year with the highest spring hunting pressure (adult harvest rate 6%), recruitment was reduced by up to 50% compared to years with no hunt and similar average climatic conditions. synthesis and applications. we conclude that there was a negative impact of the spring hunt not only on survival but also on recruitment in greater snow geese. these non-lethal effects of hunting must be considered in management decisions aimed at controlling overabundant populations where recruitment is an important driver of population growth, as occurs in geese. our study is also relevant to other situations such as in threatened species still exposed to hunting, as consideration of non-lethal effects of hunting may be critical for their conservation."

"demography of the heike firefly luciola lateralis (coleoptera: lampyridae), a representative species of japan's traditional agricultural landscape",mark-recapture; population size; rice paddy field; satoyama; aquatic insects; japan,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,KOJI S;NAKAMURA A;NAKAMURA K,"populations of the heike firefly, luciola lateralis, a representative species of japan's traditional agricultural landscape (known as satoyama), have recently experienced rapid declines in many areas of japan. owing to the popularity of this firefly, many local communities have increased conservation efforts through the restoration of aquatic habitat complexes in satoyama. to provide fundamental parameters to predict population dynamics of the firefly, we conducted a mark-recapture study in restored paddy fields, and we estimated adult population parameters such as population size, survival, recruitment, sex ratio, and body size. we found that capture probability generally decreased as the season advanced, probably because of seasonal changes in detectability and/or firefly behavior. the daily survival rate of adults decreased over the season and may be related to a seasonal decline in adult body size. adult population exhibited a highly male-biased sex ratio. firefly abundance in the restored paddy fields doubled during the 4-year study period. our analysis showed that adult detectability, recruitment, and survival rate are seasonally variable and could affect population size estimates obtained by a simple flash census. the mark-recapture technique can provide precise estimates of adult l. lateralis population characteristics and, thus, is a valuable method for predicting firefly populations and assessing the success of the restoration program."
assessing avian predation on juvenile salmonids using passive integrated transponder tag recoveries and mark-recapture methods,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,FRECHETTE D;OSTERBACK AMK;HAYES SA;BOND MH;MOORE JW;SHAFFER SA;HARVEY JT,"many populations of coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch and steelhead o. mykiss are listed under the u.s. endangered species act. until recently, the role of avian predation in limiting recovery of coho salmon and steelhead in central california coastal watersheds has been overlooked. we used recoveries of passive integrated transponder (pit) tags from ano nuevo island (ani), a breeding site for several species of piscivorous seabirds, to estimate predation rates on juvenile salmonids and identify susceptible life stages and species responsible for predation. a total of 34,485 pit tags were deployed in coho salmon and steelhead in six watersheds in san mateo and santa cruz counties. tags were deposited on ani by predators after ingestion of tagged fish. because tags were not removed from the island and were detected on multiple sampling occasions, we were able to use markrecapture models to generate a corrected minimum predation estimate. we used popan, a variation of the jollyseber model, to generate an estimate of gross population abundance, which accounted for tags deposited on the island but not detected during surveys. detections of 196 tags from surveys conducted between autumn 2006 and spring 2009 were incorporated into the model, producing a gross population estimate of 242 tags (se = 9.8). addition of tags detected between autumn 2009 and 2010 to the abundance estimate from popan produced a new minimum estimate of 362 tags on ani. western gulls larus occidentalis probably were the primary predator depositing tags on ani. minimum predation estimates ranged from 0.1% (soquel creek) to 4.6% (waddell creek) of outmigrating coho salmon and steelhead smolts. predation was potentially greater given still unquantified deposition of tags off-colony and destruction of tags during digestive processes of predators. finally, avian predators targeted estuary-reared fish, which contributed disproportionately to adult populations, further impacting imperiled salmon populations. received august 4, 2011; accepted august 27, 2012"
individual and population-level impacts of an emerging poxvirus disease in a wild population of great tits,NA,PLOS ONE,LACHISH S;BONSALL MB;LAWSON B;CUNNINGHAM AA;SHELDON BC,"emerging infectious diseases of wildlife can have severe effects on host populations and constitute a pressing problem for biodiversity conservation. paridae pox is an unusually severe form of avipoxvirus infection that has recently been identified as an emerging infectious disease particularly affecting an abundant songbird, the great tit (parus major), in great britain. in this study, we study the invasion and establishment of paridae pox in a long-term monitored population of wild great tits to (i) quantify the impact of this novel pathogen on host fitness and (ii) determine the potential threat it poses to population persistence. we show that paridae pox significantly reduces the reproductive output of great tits by reducing the ability of parents to fledge young successfully and rear those young to independence. our results also suggested that pathogen transmission from diseased parents to their offspring was possible, and that disease entails severe mortality costs for affected chicks. application of multistate mark-recapture modelling showed that paridae pox causes significant reductions to host survival, with particularly large effects observed for juvenile survival. using an age-structured population model, we demonstrate that paridae pox has the potential to reduce population growth rate, primarily through negative impacts on host survival rates. however, at currently observed prevalence, significant disease-induced population decline seems unlikely, although pox prevalence may be underestimated if capture probability of diseased individuals is low. despite this, because pox-affected model populations exhibited lower average growth rates, this emerging infectious disease has the potential to reduce the resilience of populations to other environmental factors that reduce population size."
evaluation of tuberculosis underreporting in greece through comparison with anti-tuberculosis drug consumption,NA,PLOS ONE,LYTRAS T;SPALA G;BONOVAS S;PANAGIOTOPOULOS T,"surveillance is an integral part of tuberculosis (tb) control. greece has a low tb notification rate, but there are doubts about underreporting. examining anti-tb drug consumption is a way to validate the results of surveillance and estimate tb burden in the country. we used surveillance data from 2004 to 2008 to calculate the average prescribed treatment duration with the first-line anti-tb drugs isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. we then obtained the best available data on consumption of these drugs, and calculated the number of treated cases to which these quantities correspond. we thus estimated underreporting at around 80% (77-81%), and annual tb incidence at about 30 cases per 100,000 population, five times over the notification rate. underreporting was found to be constant over the study period, while incidence followed a decreasing trend. in addition we estimated that one person receives chemoprophylaxis for latent tuberculosis infection (ltbi) for every three tb cases. these results indicate the need for a comprehensive plan to improve tb surveillance and tb contact tracing in greece, especially in light of the economic crisis affecting the country since 2009."
stress-induced tradeoffs in a free-living lizard across a variable landscape: consequences for individuals and populations,NA,PLOS ONE,LUCAS LD;FRENCH SS,"current life history theory suggests that the allocation of energetic resources between competing physiological needs should be dictated by an individual's longevity and pace of life. one key physiological pathway likely to contribute to the partitioning of resources is the vertebrate stress response. by increasing circulating glucocorticoids the stress response can exert a suite of physiological effects, such as altering immune function. we investigated the effects of stress physiology on individual immunity, reproduction and oxidative stress, across an urban landscape. we sampled populations in and around st. george, utah, examining corticosterone in response to restraint stress, two innate immune measures, reproductive output, and the presence of both reactive oxygen metabolites and antioxidant binding capacity, in populations of common side-blotched lizards (uta stansburiana) experiencing variable levels of environmental stress. additionally, using capture-mark-recapture techniques, we examined the relationships between these physiological parameters and population-level differences. our results reveal elevated physiological stress corresponds with suppressed immunity and increased oxidative stress. interestingly, urban populations experiencing the most physiological stress also exhibited greater reproductive output and decreased survival relative to rural populations experiencing less physiological stress, demonstrating a tradeoff between reproduction and life maintenance processes. our results suggest that environmental stress may augment life history strategy in this fast-paced species, and that shifts in life history strategy can in turn affect the population at large. finally, the urban environment poses definite challenges for organisms, and while it appears that side-blotched lizards are adjusting physiologically, it is unknown what fitness costs these physiological adjustments accrue."
bayesian estimation of humpback whale (megaptera novaeangliae) population abundance and movement patterns in southeastern alaska,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,HENDRIX AN;STRALEY J;GABRIELE CM;GENDE SM,"we used a mechanistic movement model within a bayesian framework to estimate survival, abundance, and rate of increase for a population of humpback whales (megaptera novaeangliae) subject to a long-term photographic capture-recapture effort in southeastern alaska, usa (seak). multiple competing models were fitted that differed in movement, recapture rates, and observation error using deviance information criterion. the median annual survival probability in the selected model was 0.996 (95% central probability interval (cri): 0.984, 0.999), which is among the highest reported for this species. movement among areas was temporally dynamic, although whales exhibited high area fidelity (probability of returning to same area of >= 0.75) throughout the study. median abundance was 1585 whales in 2008 (95% cri: 1455, 1644). incorporating an abundance estimate of 393 (95% confidence interval: 331, 455) whales from 1986, the median rate of increase was 5.1% (95% cri: 4.4%, 5.9%). although applied here to cetaceans in seak, the framework provides a flexible approach for estimating mortality and movement in populations that move among sampling areas."

to leave or not to leave: survival trade-offs between different migratory strategies in the greater flamingo,arrival-time hypothesis; capture-recapture; environmental conditions; phoenicopterus ruber; wintering,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,SANZ AGUILAR A;BECHET A;GERMAIN C;JOHNSON AR;PRADEL R,"1. the balance between costs and benefits of migration under different environmental, density-dependent and individual conditions may promote a broad range of migratory behaviours. we studied the factors influencing first-year migration and subsequent fidelity or dispersal among wintering areas, and the survival costs of different wintering behaviours in the greater flamingo (phoenicopterus roseus). 2. we analysed by multievent capturerecapture modelling among-site dispersal/fidelity and site-dependent survival probabilities from 22 671 flamingos ringed in the camargue (france) between 1977 and 2010 and resighted subsequently in their wintering grounds classified as france, iberian peninsula, italy and north africa. 3. we found that first- and second-year birds either resident or wintering at medium distances from their birth place, survived better than those wintering further afield. however, under severe winter conditions (extremely cold winter 19841985), individuals with the sedentary strategy suffered the highest levels of mortality. from the third winter onwards, the pattern of survival reversed: the long-distance wintering individuals (i.e. north africa) survived better. 4. the proportion of first-year birds migrating for wintering was highly variable among cohorts and increased with favourable environmental conditions (wet years). after the first winter, birds showed high fidelity (>90%) to their previous wintering area and wintered preferably near their natal colony when they became adults (>2 years). 5. survival estimates suggest that long-distance migration was costly for young and inexperienced individuals. nonetheless, for adults, the most southern wintering areas seem to offer the most favourable local conditions for overwinter survival. 6. the higher availability of intermediate stopover sites during wet years may facilitate first-year migration. then, once they have some wintering experience, flamingos appear to favour the known wintering grounds. as they grow older, dispersing towards the vicinity of the natal colony may provide higher breeding prospects for individuals wintering closer to this high-quality and saturated breeding ground, as predicted by the arrival-time hypothesis."
fecal genotyping reveals demographic variation in river otters inhabiting a contaminated environment,british columbia; capture-mark-recapture; contaminants; fecal genotyping; lontra canadensis; non-invasive monitoring; population genetics; river otter,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,GUERTIN DA;BEN DAVID M;HARESTAD AS;ELLIOTT JE,"the deposition and accumulation of persistent contaminants into coastal systems can have lingering negative consequences for wildlife populations and their habitats. using multi-locus genotyping of non-invasively collected feces, we assessed the effects of such pollution on reproduction, survival, genetic variability, and abundance of river otters (lontra canadensis) along a gradient of urbanindustrial development on southern vancouver island, british columbia, canada. genetic analyses indicated a pattern consistent with small-scale structuring, with individuals partitioned into 2 local subpopulationsthose identified in the contaminated harbors of southern vancouver island and points west (colwood/harbors), and those inhabiting uncontaminated habitat east of the harbors (oak bay). genetic and demographic analyses for the 2 clusters provide strong support for the conclusion that, despite contamination concerns, colwood/harbors river otters exhibited acceptable levels of survival and successfully reproduced (i.e., high levels of relatedness, high self-recruitment, and high emigration). however, our data indicate that the colwood/harbors area constitutes lower quality habitat supporting lower densities of otters, especially during winter, and excess individuals produced in that region emigrate to other areas. immigration into colwood/harbors, however, seems limited, possibly because of behavioral aversion of non-habituated otters to anthropogenic disturbance associated with the harbors and limited optimal otter habitat. our findings suggest that the effects of chronic contaminant exposure at the population level may be inadvertently mitigated through the behavioral decisions of individuals to avoid poor quality habitats. we conclude that populations of river otters can persist in and around locally contaminated sites if relatively less disturbed and contaminated habitats remain in the vicinity of the affected areas.

estimating abundance of mountain lions from unstructured spatial sampling,bayesian analysis; cougars; genetic sampling; montana; puma concolor; snow tracking; spatial capture-recapture; spatial models,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,RUSSELL RE;ROYLE JA;DESIMONE R;SCHWARTZ MK;EDWARDS VL;PILGRIM KP;MCKELVEY KS,"mountain lions (puma concolor) are often difficult to monitor because of their low capture probabilities, extensive movements, and large territories. methods for estimating the abundance of this species are needed to assess population status, determine harvest levels, evaluate the impacts of management actions on populations, and derive conservation and management strategies. traditional markrecapture methods do not explicitly account for differences in individual capture probabilities due to the spatial distribution of individuals in relation to survey effort (or trap locations). however, recent advances in the analysis of capturerecapture data have produced methods estimating abundance and density of animals from spatially explicit capturerecapture data that account for heterogeneity in capture probabilities due to the spatial organization of individuals and traps. we adapt recently developed spatial capturerecapture models to estimate density and abundance of mountain lions in western montana. volunteers and state agency personnel collected mountain lion dna samples in portions of the blackfoot drainage (7,908?km2) in west-central montana using 2 methods: snow back-tracking mountain lion tracks to collect hair samples and biopsy darting treed mountain lions to obtain tissue samples. overall, we recorded 72 individual capture events, including captures both with and without tissue sample collection and hair samples resulting in the identification of 50 individual mountain lions (30 females, 19 males, and 1 unknown sex individual). we estimated lion densities from 8 models containing effects of distance, sex, and survey effort on detection probability. our population density estimates ranged from a minimum of 3.7 mountain lions/100?km2 (95% ci 2.35.7) under the distance only model (including only an effect of distance on detection probability) to 6.7 (95% ci 3.111.0) under the full model (including effects of distance, sex, survey effort, and distance?x?sex on detection probability). these numbers translate to a total estimate of 293 mountain lions (95% ci 182451) to 529 (95% ci 245870) within the blackfoot drainage. results from the distance model are similar to previous estimates of 3.6 mountain lions/100?km2 for the study area; however, results from all other models indicated greater numbers of mountain lions. our results indicate that unstructured spatial sampling combined with spatial capturerecapture analysis can be an effective method for estimating large carnivore densities. published 2012. this article is a u.s. government work and is in the public domain in the usa."
statistical distribution of age readings of known-age sablefish (anoplopoma fimbria),known-age fish; age reading errors; geometric distribution; misclassification matrix; sablefish; stock assessment,FISHERIES RESEARCH,HANSELMAN DH;CLARK WG;HEIFETZ J;ANDERL DM,"a mark-recapture experiment provided a collection of 172 known-age sablefish from alaska waters. otoliths from each fish were read by three readers. the readings have a positive bias among young fish and a negative bias among older fish. among otoliths of the same age, some tended to give consistently high or low annulus counts, so that the variance of age readings at each true age was about half due to variance among otoliths and half due to variance among replicate readings of individual otoliths. the statistical distribution of age reading errors is well described by an asymmetrical two-sided geometric distribution with age-varying parameters. for comparison, the error distribution was estimated with naive methods that do not use the known ages and that assume the readings are unbiased. these estimated distributions do not match the actual error distributions very well, but they do a surprisingly good job of predicting the distribution of age readings from a stock assessment model's internal estimate of a true age composition. they also produce estimates of recruitment and biomass close to those obtained with the actual error distributions when used in the present sablefish stock assessment. published by elsevier b.v."
basin characteristics and temperature improve abundance estimates from standard index netting of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in small lakes,index netting; bayesian analysis; gillnets; uncertainty,FISHERIES RESEARCH,WARD HGM;ASKEY PJ;POST JR;VARKEY DA;MCALLISTER MK,"fisheries management often requires efficient methods for assessing populations across a variety of sampling units. we develop a model to assess the status of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in lakes using a fixed length of multimesh gillnets. we use mark-recapture data to examine how gillnet capture efficiency varies with lake-basin characteristics. once we accounted for variation in lake-size (net-effort density), we found that capture efficiency was best explained by surface water temperature at the time of gillnetting and lake-basin characteristics (proportion of littoral area). we use bayesian techniques to fit our model to the data and explore how uncertainty in the estimated parameters leads to uncertainty in population estimates. our analysis suggests that lake size, temperature and the proportion of littoral area can be used to predict population size using this index netting method. in addition to providing density estimates, our results help to better understand how fish ecology and behavior influences gillnet catches.

"paternal care decreases foraging activity and body condition, but does not impose survival costs to caring males in a neotropical arachnid",NA,PLOS ONE,REQUENA GS;BUZATTO BA;MARTINS EG;MACHADO G,"exclusive paternal care is the rarest form of parental investment in nature and theory predicts that the maintenance of this behavior depends on the balance between costs and benefits to males. our goal was to assess costs of paternal care in the harvestman iporangaia pustulosa, for which the benefits of this behavior in terms of egg survival have already been demonstrated. we evaluated energetic costs and mortality risks associated to paternal egg-guarding in the field. we quantified foraging activity of males and estimated how their body condition is influenced by the duration of the caring period. additionally, we conducted a one-year capture-mark-recapture study and estimated apparent survival probabilities of caring and non-caring males to assess potential survival costs of paternal care. our results indicate that caring males forage less frequently than non-caring individuals (males and females) and that their body condition deteriorates over the course of the caring period. thus, males willing to guard eggs may provide to females a fitness-enhancing gift of cost-free care of their offspring. caring males, however, did not show lower survival probabilities when compared to both non-caring males and females. reduction in mortality risks as a result of remaining stationary, combined with the benefits of improving egg survival, may have played an important and previously unsuspected role favoring the evolution of paternal care. moreover, males exhibiting paternal care could also provide an honest signal of their quality as offspring defenders, and thus female preference for caring males could be responsible for maintaining the trait."

evaluation of remote delivery of passive integrated transponder (pit) technology to mark large mammals,NA,PLOS ONE,WALTER WD;ANDERSON CW;VERCAUTEREN KC,"methods to individually mark and identify free-ranging wildlife without trapping and handling would be useful for a variety of research and management purposes. the use of passive integrated transponder technology could be an efficient method for collecting data for mark-recapture analysis and other strategies for assessing characteristics about populations of various wildlife species. passive integrated transponder tags (pit) have unique numbered frequencies and have been used to successfully mark and identify mammals. we tested for successful injection of pit and subsequent functioning of pit into gelatin blocks using 4 variations of a prototype dart. we then selected the prototype dart that resulted in the least depth of penetration in the gelatin block to assess the ability of pit to be successfully implanted into muscle tissue of white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) post-mortem and long-term in live, captive rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus). the prototype dart with a 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) needle length and no powder charge resulted in the shallowest mean (+/- sd) penetration depth into gelatin blocks of 27.0 mm (+/-5.6 mm) with 2.0 psi setting on the dan-inject co2-pressured rifle. eighty percent of pit were successfully injected in the muscle mass of white-tailed deer post-mortem with a mean (+/- sd) penetration depth of 22.2 mm (+/-3.8 mm; n = 6). we injected pit successfully into 13 live, captive elk by remote delivery at about 20 m that remained functional for 7 months. we successfully demonstrated that pit could be remotely delivered in darts into muscle mass of large mammals and remain functional for >6 months. although further research is warranted to fully develop the technique, remote delivery of pit technology to large mammals is possible using prototype implant darts."
latitudinal and seasonal effects on growth of the australian eastern king prawn (melicertus plebejus),NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,LLOYD JONES LR;WANG YG;COURTNEY AJ;PROSSER AJ;MONTGOMERY SS,"the growth of the australian eastern king prawn (melicertus plebejus) is understood in greater detail by quantifying the latitudinal effect. the latitudinal effect is the change in the species' growth rate during migration. mark-recapture data (n = 1635, latitude 22.21 degrees s-34.00 degrees s) presents northerly movement of the eastern king prawn, with new south wales prawns showing substantial average movement of 140 km (standard deviation: 176 km) north. a generalized von bertalanffy growth model framework is used to incorporate the latitudinal effect together with the canonical seasonal effect. applying this method to eastern king prawn mark-recapture data guarantees consistent estimates for the latitudinal and seasonal effects. for m. plebejus, it was found that growth rate peaks on 25 and 29 january for males and females, respectively; is at a minimum on 27 and 31 july, respectively; and that the shape parameter, k (per year), changes by -0.0236 and -0.0556 every 1 degree of latitude south increase for males and females, respectively."

exploiting uncertain ecological fieldwork data with multi-event capture-recapture modelling: an example with bird sex assignment,fieldwork; multi-event capture-recapture; sex assignment; survival probability; uncertainty,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,GENOVART M;PRADEL R;ORO D,"1. sex plays a crucial role in evolutionary life histories. however, the inclusion of sex in demographic analysis may be a challenge in fieldwork, particularly in monomorphic species. although behavioural data may help us to sex individuals in the field, this kind of data is unlikely to be error free and is usually discarded. 2. here we propose a multi-event capturerecapture model that enables us to exploit uncertain field observations regarding the sex of individuals based on behavioural or morphological criteria. the multi-event capturerecapture model allows us to account for sex uncertainty not restricting our ability to estimate the parameters of interest. in this case, by adding the confirmed sex of just a few individuals, we greatly improve the efficiency of the optimization algorithm. 3. using such an approach, we analysed sex differences in demographic parameters (e.g. survival, transience and sex ratio) in a population of audouins gulls using observations from long-term fieldwork monitoring (19882007). we also assessed the probability of ascertaining sex over time and the probability of error for each field-sexing criterion. 4. we detected no strong effect of sex on either survival or transience probabilities, and both sexes showed a decreasing trend in survival over time and transience probability after recruitment increased with age and over time. the probability of ascertaining sex over time depended on observers experience. strikingly, courtship feeding (but not copulation) emerged as the most reliable clue for sexing individuals, which would suggest that audouins gulls engage in same-sex sexual behaviour such as same-sex mounting. 5. the present modelling emerged as a reliable method for estimating demographic parameters and state transition parameters in ecological studies in which field observations of sex or other individual states are assigned erroneously and uncertainly. this approach could also be useful for applied ecologists for assessing the reliability of their criteria for assigning sex or other individual covariates in the field, thereby permitting them to optimizing their field ecological protocols."
frog population viability under present and future climate conditions: a bayesian state-space approach,capture-recapture analysis; climate change; ecological forecasting; population viability analysis; rana luteiventris; snow-water equivalence,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,MCCAFFERY R;SOLONEN A;CRONE E,"1. world-wide extinctions of amphibians are at the forefront of the biodiversity crisis, with climate change figuring prominently as a potential driver of continued amphibian decline. as in other taxa, changes in both the mean and variability of climate conditions may affect amphibian populations in complex, unpredictable ways. in western north america, climate models predict a reduced duration and extent of mountain snowpack and increased variability in precipitation, which may have consequences for amphibians inhabiting montane ecosystems. 2. we used bayesian capturerecapture methods to estimate survival and transition probabilities in a high-elevation population of the columbia spotted frog (rana luteiventris) over 10 years and related these rates to interannual variation in peak snowpack. then, we forecasted frog population growth and viability under a range of scenarios with varying levels of change in mean and variance in snowpack. 3. over a range of future scenarios, changes in mean snowpack had a greater effect on viability than changes in the variance of snowpack, with forecasts largely predicting an increase in population viability. population models based on snowpack during our study period predicted a declining population. 4. although mean conditions were more important for viability than variance, for a given mean snowpack depth, increases in variability could change a population from increasing to decreasing. therefore, the influence of changing climate variability on populations should be accounted for in predictive models. the bayesian modelling framework allows for the explicit characterization of uncertainty in parameter estimates and ecological forecasts, and thus provides a natural approach for examining relative contributions of mean and variability in climatic variables to population dynamics. 5. longevity and heterogeneous habitat may contribute to the potential for this amphibian species to be resilient to increased climatic variation, and shorter-lived species inhabiting homogeneous ecosystems may be more susceptible to increased variability in climate conditions."

exposure of black-legged kittiwakes to lyme disease spirochetes: dynamics of the immune status of adult hosts and effects on their survival,antibody persistence; immuno-ecology; lyme disease bacteria; misclassification; rissa tridactyla; seroconversion dynamics; state uncertainty,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,CHAMBERT T;STASZEWSKI V;LOBATO E;CHOQUET R;CARRIE C;MCCOY KD;TVERAA T;BOULINIER T,"1. despite a growing interest in wildlife disease ecology, there is a surprising lack of knowledge about the exposure dynamics of individual animals to naturally circulating infectious agents and the impact of such agents on host life-history traits. 2. the exploration of these questions requires detailed longitudinal data on individual animals that can be captured multiple times during their life but also requires being able to account for several sources of uncertainty, notably the partial observation or recapture of individuals at each sampling occasion. 3. we use a multi-year dataset to (i) assess the potential effect of exposure to the tick-borne agent of lyme disease, borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (bbsl), on adult apparent survival for one of its natural long-lived hosts, the black-legged kittiwake (rissa tridactyla), and (ii) investigate the temporal dynamics of individual immunological status in kittiwakes to infer the rate of new exposure and the persistence of the immune response. using a multi-event modelling approach, potential uncertainties arising from partial observations were explicitly taken into account. 4. the potential impact of bbsl on kittiwake survival was also evaluated via an experimental approach: the apparent survival of a group of breeding birds treated with an antibiotic was compared with that of a control group. 5. no impact of exposure to bbsl was detected on adult survival in kittiwakes, in either observational or experimental data. 6. an annual seroconversion rate (from negative to positive) of 1.5% was estimated, but once an individual became seropositive, it remained so with a probability of 1, suggesting that detectable levels of anti-bbsl antibodies persist for multiple years. 7. these results, in combination with knowledge on patterns of exposure to the tick vector of bbsl, provide important information for understanding the spatio-temporal nature of the interaction between this host and several of its parasites. furthermore, our analyses highlight the utility of capturemarkrecapture approaches handling state uncertainty for disease ecology studies."
a hierarchical modeling framework for multiple observer transect surveys,NA,PLOS ONE,CONN PB;LAAKE JL;JOHNSON DS,"ecologists often use multiple observer transect surveys to census animal populations. in addition to animal counts, these surveys produce sequences of detections and non-detections for each observer. when combined with additional data (i.e. covariates such as distance from the transect line), these sequences provide the additional information to estimate absolute abundance when detectability on the transect line is less than one. although existing analysis approaches for such data have proven extremely useful, they have some limitations. for instance, it is difficult to extrapolate from observed areas to unobserved areas unless a rigorous sampling design is adhered to; it is also difficult to share information across spatial and temporal domains or to accommodate habitat-abundance relationships. in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical modeling framework for multiple observer line transects that removes these limitations. in particular, abundance intensities can be modeled as a function of habitat covariates, making it easier to extrapolate to unsampled areas. our approach relies on a complete data representation of the state space, where unobserved animals and their covariates are modeled using a reversible jump markov chain monte carlo algorithm. observer detections are modeled via a bivariate normal distribution on the probit scale, with dependence induced by a distance-dependent correlation parameter. we illustrate performance of our approach with simulated data and on a known population of golf tees. in both cases, we show that our hierarchical modeling approach yields accurate inference about abundance and related parameters. in addition, we obtain accurate inference about population-level covariates (e.g. group size). we recommend that ecologists consider using hierarchical models when analyzing multiple-observer transect data, especially when it is difficult to rigorously follow pre-specified sampling designs. we provide a new r package, hierarchicalds, to facilitate the building and fitting of these models."

monitoring butterfly abundance: beyond pollard walks,NA,PLOS ONE,PELLET J;BRIED JT;PARIETTI D;GANDER A;HEER PO;CHERIX D;ARLETTAZ R,"most butterfly monitoring protocols rely on counts along transects (pollard walks) to generate species abundance indices and track population trends. it is still too often ignored that a population count results from two processes: the biological process (true abundance) and the statistical process (our ability to properly quantify abundance). because individual detectability tends to vary in space (e.g., among sites) and time (e.g., among years), it remains unclear whether index counts truly reflect population sizes and trends. this study compares capture-mark-recapture (absolute abundance) and count-index (relative abundance) monitoring methods in three species (maculinea nausithous and iolana iolas: lycaenidae; minois dryas: satyridae) in contrasted habitat types. we demonstrate that intraspecific variability in individual detectability under standard monitoring conditions is probably the rule rather than the exception, which questions the reliability of count-based indices to estimate and compare specific population abundance. our results suggest that the accuracy of count-based methods depends heavily on the ecology and behavior of the target species, as well as on the type of habitat in which surveys take place. monitoring programs designed to assess the abundance and trends in butterfly populations should incorporate a measure of detectability. we discuss the relative advantages and inconveniences of current monitoring methods and analytical approaches with respect to the characteristics of the species under scrutiny and resources availability."
age and sex composition of seals killed by polar bears in the eastern beaufort sea,NA,PLOS ONE,PILFOLD NW;DEROCHER AE;STIRLING I;RICHARDSON E;ANDRIASHEK D,"background: polar bears (ursus maritimus) of the beaufort sea enter hyperphagia in spring and gain fat reserves to survive periods of low prey availability. we collected information on seals killed by polar bears (n = 650) and hunting attempts on ringed seal (pusa hispida) lairs (n = 1396) observed from a helicopter during polar bear mark-recapture studies in the eastern beaufort sea in spring in 1985-2011. we investigated how temporal shifts in ringed seal reproduction affect kill composition and the intraspecific vulnerabilities of ringed seals to polar bear predation. principal findings: polar bears primarily preyed on ringed seals (90.2%) while bearded seals (erignathus barbatus) only comprised 9.8% of the kills, but 33% of the biomass. adults comprised 43.6% (150/344) of the ringed seals killed, while their pups comprised 38.4% (132/344). juvenile ringed seals were killed at the lowest proportion, comprising 18.0% (62/344) of the ringed seal kills. the proportion of ringed seal pups was highest between 2007-2011, in association with high ringed seal productivity. half of the adult ringed seal kills were >= 21 years (60/121), and kill rates of adults increased following the peak of parturition. determination of sex from dna revealed that polar bears killed adult male and adult female ringed seals equally (0.50, n = 78). the number of hunting attempts at ringed seal subnivean lair sites was positively correlated with the number of pup kills (r(2) = 0.30, p = 0.04), but was not correlated with the number of adult kills (p = 0.37). conclusions/significance: results are consistent with decadal trends in ringed seal productivity, with low numbers of pups killed by polar bears in spring in years of low pup productivity, and conversely when pup productivity was high. vulnerability of adult ringed seals to predation increased in relation to reproductive activities and age, but not gender."
combined spatio-temporal impacts of climate and longline fisheries on the survival of a trans-equatorial marine migrant,NA,PLOS ONE,RAMOS R;GRANADEIRO JP;NEVOUX M;MOUGIN JL;DIAS MP;CATRY P,"predicting the impact of human activities and their derivable consequences, such as global warming or direct wildlife mortality, is increasingly relevant in our changing world. due to their particular life history traits, long-lived migrants are amongst the most endangered and sensitive group of animals to these harming effects. our ability to identify and quantify such anthropogenic threats in both breeding and wintering grounds is, therefore, of key importance in the field of conservation biology. using long-term capture-recapture data (34 years, 4557 individuals) and year-round tracking data (4 years, 100 individuals) of a trans-equatorial migrant, the cory's shearwater (calonectris diomedea), we investigated the impact of longline fisheries and climatic variables in both breeding and wintering areas on the most important demographic trait of this seabird, i.e. adult survival. annual adult survival probability was estimated at 0.914+/-0.022 on average, declining throughout 1978-1999 but recovering during the last decade (2005-2011). our results suggest that both the incidental bycatch associated with longline fisheries and high sea surface temperatures (indirectly linked to food availability; sst) increased mortality rates during the long breeding season (march-october). shearwater survival was also negatively affected during the short non-breeding season (december-february) by positive episodes of the southern oscillation index (soi). indirect negative effects of climate at both breeding (sst) and wintering grounds (soi) had a greater impact on survival than longliner activity, and indeed these climatic factors are those which are expected to present more unfavourable trends in the future. our work underlines the importance of considering both breeding and wintering habitats as well as precise schedules/phenology when assessing the global role of the local impacts on the dynamics of migratory species."

standardizing the double-observer survey method for estimating mountain ungulate prey of the endangered snow leopard,capra ibex; bharal; pseudois nayaur; ovis; central asia,OECOLOGIA,SURYAWANSHI KR;BHATNAGAR YV;MISHRA C,"mountain ungulates around the world have been threatened by illegal hunting, habitat modification, increased livestock grazing, disease and development. mountain ungulates play an important functional role in grasslands as primary consumers and as prey for wild carnivores, and monitoring of their populations is important for conservation purposes. however, most of the several currently available methods of estimating wild ungulate abundance are either difficult to implement or too expensive for mountainous terrain. a rigorous method of sampling ungulate abundance in mountainous areas that can allow for some measure of sampling error is therefore much needed. to this end, we used a combination of field data and computer simulations to test the critical assumptions associated with double-observer technique based on capture-recapture theory. the technique was modified and adapted to estimate the populations of bharal (pseudois nayaur) and ibex (capra sibirica) at five different sites. conducting the two double-observer surveys simultaneously led to underestimation of the population by 15%. we therefore recommend separating the surveys in space or time. the overall detection probability for the two observers was 0.74 and 0.79. our surveys estimated mountain ungulate populations (+/- 95% confidence interval) of 735 (+/- 44), 580 (+/- 46), 509 (+/- 53), 184 (+/- 40) and 30 (+/- 14) individuals at the five sites, respectively. a detection probability of 0.75 was found to be sufficient to detect a change of 20% in populations of > 420 individuals. based on these results, we believe that this method is sufficiently precise for scientific and conservation purposes and therefore recommend the use of the double-observer approach (with the two surveys separated in time or space) for the estimation and monitoring of mountain ungulate populations."
fish catchability and comparison of four electrofishing crews in mediterranean streams,capture probability; fish abundance; sampling effort; program mark; water framework directive,FISHERIES RESEARCH,BENEJAM L;ALCARAZ C;BENITO J;CAIOLA N;CASALS F;MACEDA VEIGA A;DE SOSTOA A;GARCIA BERTHOU E,"the knowledge of capture efficiency and side effects of electrofishing is essential for research and monitoring of stream fish populations. differences amongst electrofishing crews have hardly been investigated and are particularly important given the on-going implementation of the water framework directive and wide-ranging exchange of data worldwide. we aimed to assess fish catchability in mediterranean streams and to compare four electrofishing crews (with minor differences in gears used) and their short-term effects on fish populations. in eight different sites, we compared two adjacent stations, one sampled with conventional single-pass catch-effort data and the other closed with block nets and with four-pass removal estimates. we used a williams' cross-over design to estimate the independent effects of repeated sampling in four consecutive days, site and crew and also to assess a potential carry-over effect. we modelled capture probability and estimated population size using program mark and an information-theoretic framework. our results show that electrofishing was generally efficient in these reaches, with 50-100% of the species and of 40-60% of the individuals captured in a single pass. the cpue was significantly higher at sites blocked with nets than at open sites, but observed richness was not significantly different. capture probability was generally not constant along removal passes and increased with fish size. observed fish richness and species composition did not depend on electrofishing crew and fishing day and there was no significant carryover effect. there were, however, significant differences in single-pass cpue estimates amongst electrofishing crews, after accounting for other sources of variation. there was also a significant carry-over effect, surprisingly with increasing fish captured after fishing by specific crews. overall, our results suggest that although capture probability depends heavily on a number of factors (such as species, size, and sampling site) and needs careful consideration, the effect of electrofishing crew is negligible for assessment of species richness and composition but considerable for fish abundance.

unusually high body mass in virginia meadow voles,body growth; life span; mass; meadow vole; microtus pennsylvanicus; virginia,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,LONGTIN SB;ROSE RK,"we used monthly capture-mark-recapture information to determine growth rates and life spans for 2 populations of meadow voles studied for 28 and 29 months in eastern virginia in order to learn whether the exceptionally large body masses of some voles were due to rapid growth, long lives, or both. on 1 study grid, 64 males (19%) and 43 nonpregnant females (11%) were >= 70 g, with the largest male being 89 g. mostly positive growth rates (averaging 1.1-3.9 g/month) were recorded, even in autumn and winter months, times when meadow voles are losing mass in northern populations, where most studies of body growth have been conducted. periods of low mean body mass were associated with low population density more than high body mass was associated with high population density. patterns of body mass dynamics were related more to season than to density in our populations. we concluded that the large body masses we observed in some voles were due more to long field lives than to unusually high rates of body growth."
a multi-event model to study stage-dependent dispersal in radio-collared hares: when hunting promotes costly transience,capture-recapture; dispersal costs; lepus europaeus; predation risk; telemetry,ECOLOGY,AVRIL A;LETTY J;PRADEL R;LEONARD Y;SANTIN JANIN H;PONTIER D,"behavioral ecologists have often assumed that dispersal is costly mainly because of unfamiliarity with traversed habitats during dispersal and energy costs of the movement per se; thus, dispersers that have successfully settled should experience survival rates comparable to those of philopatric individuals. in this paper, we tested that hypothesis using 152 radio-collared european hares in a harvested population. we developed a multi-event capture-recapture model, combining telemetry data and recoveries and separately modeling the foray probability, the settlement probability, and the permanent dispersal probability. the parameterization introduced here raises the possibility of separately testing effects on survival and dispersal probabilities at each stage of dispersal (departure, transience, and settlement). in accordance with our expectations, we reveal that dispersers incur higher mortality risks during transience and the early settlement period than philopatric individuals or settled dispersers. we also found that dispersers suffer from higher risks of being shot. those results illustrate that unfamiliarity with the habitat during transience makes dispersal costly and that settled dispersers may enjoy survival rates comparable to those of philopatric individuals. surprisingly, we also found that individuals have a higher probability of foraying during the hunting season. we suggest that hunting and related disturbances increase dispersal costs both by increasing mortality risk during transience and (perhaps) by increasing movement rates. we emphasize the need to take human pressures into account as factors that may drive the demographics of movements in populations."
evaluating population recovery for sea turtles under nesting beach protection while accounting for nesting behaviours and changes in availability,bycatch; capture-mark-recapture; extended cormack-jolly-seber; fixed-knot spline; leatherback sea turtle; loggerhead sea turtle; longline tuna fishing; robust design data; tag loss; western indian ocean,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,THORSON JT;PUNT AE;NEL R,"1. sea turtles and sea birds generally have high conservation importance world-wide and are often difficult to survey except when present on nesting grounds. consequently, many such surveys tag nesting individuals and use tag-resighting models to estimate population size and assess anthropogenic impacts. however, the conventional cormacjollyseber (cjs) tag-resighting model is problematic for these species for three reasons: individuals often return to nesting areas in alternating years because of high energetic costs for nesting, estimated detectability confounds changes in survey efficiency with availability on the surveyed beach, and tag loss is confounded with mortality. 2. we develop a robust design model that uses higher-order markovian transitions to approximate skip-nesting behaviours and incorporates multiple observations for each nesting individual to estimate changes in availability (the probability of returning to the surveyed area rather than alternative nesting areas). we approximate time-varying effects using a flexible spline method and demonstrate the model using data for leatherback sea turtles dermochelys coriacea and loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta in south africa. 3. the apparent lack of recovery for leatherback sea turtles after implementing beach protection, as observed in nest count data, is likely to be due to declining detectability caused by decreased availability during population recovery (e.g. habitat expansion). by contrast, loggerhead sea turtles have approximately constant detectability and stable abundance since the 1970s. 4. we find that increased fishing effort has no explanatory power regarding changes in survival for either species. 5. synthesis and applications. based on study results, we recommend that future tag-resighting programmes for sea turtles and birds are accompanied periodically by count surveys beyond the regularly monitored nesting areas to evaluate evidence of range expansion. however, the identification of range expansion in historical data is only possible using model-based inference and robust design methods such as presented in this study."
comparison and cost-benefit analysis of pit tag antennae resighting and seine-net recapture techniques for survival analysis of an estuarine-dependent fish,centropomus undecimalis; mark-recapture; open population survival; juvenile fish; telemetry; marine,FISHERIES RESEARCH,BARBOUR AB;ADAMS AJ;YESS T;BEHRINGER DC;WOLFE RK,"studies of fish ecology are enhanced by precise and accurate knowledge of survival, which can be estimated from capture-recapture/resighting based survival probabilities. we conducted a cost-benefit analysis of resighting by an array of 11 autonomous pit tag antennae and recapture by seine netting, and compared the effectiveness of the two methods for recapturing/resighting marked fish in an estuarine environment. during three separate marking periods, we marked a total of 2109 fish with pit tags, recapturing 106 by seine (5.0%) and resighting 1700 by antennae (80.6%). antennae resulted in precise monthly survival estimates while seine netting did not, but antennae did not collect ancillary data (e.g., growth) and their use was limited to areas where fish used constricted passes <10-30m in width. despite a reliance on seine nets to capture fish for marking and high initial construction costs, the cost-effectiveness of pit tag antennae (us$45-$57 per unique fish resighted) exceeded that of seine netting (us$167-$934). considering physical capture was required to mark fish, the use of pit tag antennae is a dual-method approach incorporating both physical captures and telemetry. this dual-method approach can collect cost-effective and highly detailed data that could enhance our ability to make informed management and conservation decisions.

sin nombre hantavirus decreases survival of male deer mice,sin nombre virus; hantavirus; peromyscus; critical host density; mark-capture-recapture; disease-induced mortality,OECOLOGIA,LUIS AD;DOUGLASS RJ;HUDSON PJ;MILLS JN;BJORNSTAD ON,"how pathogens affect their hosts is a key question in infectious disease ecology, and it can have important influences on the spread and persistence of the pathogen. sin nombre virus (snv) is the etiological agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (hps) in humans. a better understanding of snv in its reservoir host, the deer mouse, could lead to improved predictions of the circulation and persistence of the virus in the mouse reservoir, and could help identify the factors that lead to increased human risk of hps. using mark-recapture statistical modeling on longitudinal data collected over 15 years, we found a 13.4% decrease in the survival of male deer mice with antibodies to snv compared to uninfected mice (both male and female). there was also an additive effect of breeding condition, with a 21.3% decrease in survival for infected mice in breeding condition compared to uninfected, non-breeding mice. the data identified that transmission was consistent with density-dependent transmission, implying that there may be a critical host density below which snv cannot persist. the notion of a critical host density coupled with the previously overlooked disease-induced mortality reported here contribute to a better understanding of why snv often goes extinct locally and only seems to persist at the metapopulation scale, and why human spillover is episodic and hard to predict."
sea snakes rarely venture far from home,coral reefs; demographic isolation; live-bearing; marine reptile; philopatry,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,LUKOSCHEK V;SHINE R,"the extent to which populations are connected by dispersal influences all aspects of their biology and informs the spatial scale of optimal conservation strategies. obtaining direct estimates of dispersal is challenging, particularly in marine systems, with studies typically relying on indirect approaches to evaluate connectivity. to overcome this challenge, we combine information from an eight-year mark-recapture study with high-resolution genetic data to demonstrate extremely low dispersal and restricted gene flow at small spatial scales for a large, potentially mobile marine vertebrate, the turtleheaded sea snake (emydocephalus annulatus). our mark-recapture study indicated that adjacent bays in new caledonia (<1.15 km apart) contain virtually separate sea snake populations. sea snakes could easily swim between bays but rarely do so. of 817 recaptures of marked snakes, only two snakes had moved between bays. we genotyped 136 snakes for 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci and found statistically significant genetic divergence between the two bays (f-st = 0.008, p < 0.01). bayesian clustering analyses detected low mixed ancestry within bays and genetic relatedness coefficients were higher, on average, within than between bays. our results indicate that turtleheaded sea snakes rarely venture far from home, which has strong implications for their ecology, evolution, and conservation."
estimating grizzly and black bear population abundance and trend in banff national park using noninvasive genetic sampling,NA,PLOS ONE,SAWAYA MA;STETZ JB;CLEVENGER AP;GIBEAU ML;KALINOWSKI ST,"we evaluated the potential of two noninvasive genetic sampling methods, hair traps and bear rub surveys, to estimate population abundance and trend of grizzly (ursus arctos) and black bear (u. americanus) populations in banff national park, alberta, canada. using huggins closed population mark-recapture models, we obtained the first precise abundance estimates for grizzly bears ((n) over cap = 73.5, 95% ci = 64-94 in 2006; (n) over cap = 50.4, 95% ci = 49-59 in 2008) and black bears ((n) over cap = 62.6, 95% ci = 51-89 in 2006; (n) over cap = 81.8, 95% ci = 72-102 in 2008) in the bow valley. hair traps had high detection rates for female grizzlies, and male and female black bears, but extremely low detection rates for male grizzlies. conversely, bear rubs had high detection rates for male and female grizzlies, but low rates for black bears. we estimated realized population growth rates, lambda, for grizzly bear males (lambda = 0.93, 95% ci = 0.74-1.17) and females (lambda = 0.90, 95% ci = 0.67-1.20) using pradel open population models with three years of bear rub data. lambda estimates are supported by abundance estimates from combined hair trap/bear rub closed population models and are consistent with a system that is likely driven by high levels of human-caused mortality. our results suggest that bear rub surveys would provide an efficient and powerful means to inventory and monitor grizzly bear populations in the central canadian rocky mountains."
losing a staging area: eastward redistribution of afro-eurasian ruffs is associated with deteriorating fuelling conditions along the western flyway,capture-recapture modelling; carry-over effect; grassland birds; migration; population estimates; stopover ecology,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,VERKUIL YI;KARLIONOVA N;RAKHIMBERDIEV EN;JUKEMA J;WIJMENGA JJ;HOOIJMEIJER JCEW;PINCHUK P;WYMENGA E;BAKER AJ;PIERSMA T,"the fuelling performance of long-distance migrants at staging areas indicates local conditions and determines the viability of migration routes. here we present a first case study where long-term fuelling performance was documented along two migration routes with differential population trends. ruffs (philomachus pugnax) are shorebirds of inland freshwater wetlands that migrate from the sub-saharan wintering grounds, via europe, to the northern eurasian breeding grounds. assessments from 2001 to 2008 of fuelling during northward migration at the major western and eastern staging site revealed that daily mass gain rates steeply declined across years in the grasslands for dairy production in friesland, the netherlands, and remained constant in the pripyat floodplains in belarus, 1500 km further east. migrants in friesland decreased from 2001 to 2010 by 66%, amounting to a loss of 21,000 individuals when counts were adjusted for length of stay as determined by resightings. in the same period numbers in pripyat increased by 12,000. ruffs individually ringed in friesland were resighted in subsequent springs at increasingly eastern sites including pripyat. our results corroborate published evidence for an eastward redistribution of arctic breeding ruffs and suggest that the decreasing fuelling rates in the westernmost staging area contribute to this redistribution. the shift implies that responses occur within a single generation. the hypothesis that the choice of route during northward migration may be driven by food availability can now be tested by creating greater areas of wet grasslands in friesland. when local staging conditions improve we predict that ruffs will make the reverse shift.

genetic tagging reveals a significant impact of poison baiting on an invasive species,australia; density; invasive species; microsatellite dna; pest management; red fox; survival; vulpes vulpes,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BERRY O;ALGAR D;ANGUS J;HAMILTON N;HILMER S;SUTHERLAND D,"globally, invasive predators are major pests of agriculture and biodiversity and are the focus of comprehensive control programs. because these species are typically elusive, wary of traps, and occur at low densities, their fundamental population dynamics are difficult to determine and quantitative evaluations of control programs are rarely conducted. noninvasive dna analysis has the potential to resolve this long-standing limitation to pest management. we carried out a landscape-scale experiment to quantify reduction in the abundance of a red fox (vulpes vulpes) population when baited with sodium fluoroacetate (1080) poison (the most widely used method of fox control in australia). we collected fox hairs with hair snares during 4 4-day sessions over the course of 6 months at a site in semi-arid western australia. the first session took place in late summer just prior to when juvenile foxes typically disperse, and the final session followed aerial baiting with 1080 poison. we obtained consensus microsatellite genotypes from 196 samples, and used them to conduct both spatially explicit and open model capturerecapture analysis. twenty-eight percent of trap nights yielded hair samples suitable for identification of individual foxes, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than trapping rates reported with conventional techniques. fox density changed little during 3 pre-baiting sessions and averaged 0.73?foxes/km2 (+/- 0.33?se), which is less than most previous trap-based estimates for australian foxes. density dropped significantly in response to baiting to 0.004?foxes/km2. prior to baiting, the apparent survival of foxes remained static (0.72 +/- 0.14?se), but in response to baiting it dropped precipitously and was effectively zero. this experiment provides the first quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of 1080 poison baiting for reducing fox density, and in this case demonstrates it to be a highly effective method for culling foxes from a region. further, it demonstrates that noninvasive dna analysis will provide significantly more data than conventional trapping methods. this method is likely to provide greater precision and accuracy than conventional methods and therefore result in more robust evaluations of management strategies for the fox in australia, and for cryptic species elsewhere.

a framework for inference about carnivore density from unstructured spatial sampling of scat using detector dogs,bayesian; density; fisher; martes pennanti; scat detector dogs; winbugs,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,THOMPSON CM;ROYLE JA;GARNER JD,"wildlife management often hinges upon an accurate assessment of population density. although undeniably useful, many of the traditional approaches to density estimation such as visual counts, livetrapping, or markrecapture suffer from a suite of methodological and analytical weaknesses. rare, secretive, or highly mobile species exacerbate these problems through the reality of small sample sizes and movement on and off study sites. in response to these difficulties, there is growing interest in the use of non-invasive survey techniques, which provide the opportunity to collect larger samples with minimal increases in effort, as well as the application of analytical frameworks that are not reliant on large sample size arguments. one promising survey technique, the use of scat detecting dogs, offers a greatly enhanced probability of detection while at the same time generating new difficulties with respect to non-standard survey routes, variable search intensity, and the lack of a fixed survey point for characterizing non-detection. in order to account for these issues, we modified an existing spatially explicit, capturerecapture model for camera trap data to account for variable search intensity and the lack of fixed, georeferenced trap locations. we applied this modified model to a fisher (martes pennanti) dataset from the sierra national forest, california, and compared the results (12.3?fishers/100?km2) to more traditional density estimates. we then evaluated model performance using simulations at 3 levels of population density. simulation results indicated that estimates based on the posterior mode were relatively unbiased. we believe that this approach provides a flexible analytical framework for reconciling the inconsistencies between detector dog survey data and density estimation procedures.

wet season range fidelity in a tropical migratory ungulate,breeding; migration; reproduction; residency; tarangire national park,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,MORRISON TA;BOLGER DT,"1. in migratory populations, the degree of fidelity and dispersal among seasonal ranges is an important population process with consequences for demography, management, sensitivity to habitat change and adaptation to local environmental conditions. 2. characterizing patterns of range fidelity in ungulates, however, has remained challenging because of the difficulties of following large numbers of marked individuals across multiple migratory cycles and of identifying the appropriate scale of analysis. 3. we examined fidelity to wet season (i.e. breeding) ranges in a recently declining population of wildebeest connochaetes taurinus burchell in northern tanzania across 3 years. we used computer-assisted photographic identification and capture-recapture to characterize return patterns to three wet season ranges that were ecologically discrete and topographically isolated from one another. 4. among 2557 uniquely identified adult wildebeest, we observed 150 recaptures across consecutive wet seasons. between the two migratory subpopulations, the probability of remaining faithful to wet season areas ranged between 0 82 and 1 00. animals from a non-migratory segment of the population (near lake manyara national park) were rarely observed in other wet season ranges, despite proximity to one of the migratory pathways. 5. we found no effect of sex on an individuals' probability of switching wet season ranges. however, the breeding status of females in year i had a strong influence on patterns of range selection in year i + 1, with surviving breeders over three times as likely to switch ranges as non-breeders. 6. social-group associations between pairs of recaptured animals were random with respect to an individual's wet season range during the previous or forthcoming wet seasons, suggesting that an individual's herd identity during the dry season does not predict wet season range selection. 7. examining fidelity and dispersal in terrestrial migrations improves our understanding of the constraints that migrants experience when they face rapid habitat changes or fluctuations in environmental conditions."

how does spatial study design influence density estimates from spatial capture-recapture models?,NA,PLOS ONE,SOLLMANN R;GARDNER B;BELANT JL,"when estimating population density from data collected on non-invasive detector arrays, recently developed spatial capture-recapture (scr) models present an advance over non-spatial models by accounting for individual movement. while these models should be more robust to changes in trapping designs, they have not been well tested. here we investigate how the spatial arrangement and size of the trapping array influence parameter estimates for scr models. we analysed black bear data collected with 123 hair snares with an scr model accounting for differences in detection and movement between sexes and across the trapping occasions. to see how the size of the trap array and trap dispersion influence parameter estimates, we repeated analysis for data from subsets of traps: 50% chosen at random, 50% in the centre of the array and 20% in the south of the array. additionally, we simulated and analysed data under a suite of trap designs and home range sizes. in the black bear study, we found that results were similar across trap arrays, except when only 20% of the array was used. black bear density was approximately 10 individuals per 100 km(2). our simulation study showed that scr models performed well as long as the extent of the trap array was similar to or larger than the extent of individual movement during the study period, and movement was at least half the distance between traps. scr models performed well across a range of spatial trap setups and animal movements. contrary to non-spatial capture-recapture models, they do not require the trapping grid to cover an area several times the average home range of the studied species. this renders scr models more appropriate for the study of wide-ranging mammals and more flexible to design studies targeting multiple species."
helpers at the nest improve late-life offspring performance: evidence from a long-term study and a cross-foster experiment,NA,PLOS ONE,BROUWER L;RICHARDSON DS;KOMDEUR J,"background: conditions during an individual's rearing period can have far reaching consequences for its survival and reproduction later in life. conditions typically vary due to variation in parental quality and/or the environment, but in cooperative breeders the presence of helpers adds an important component to this. determining the causal effect of helpers on offspring fitness is difficult, since high-quality breeders or territories are likely to produce high-quality offspring, but are also more likely to have helpers because of past reproductive success. this problem is best resolved by comparing the effect of both helping and non-helping subordinates on offspring fitness, however species in which both type of subordinates commonly occur are rare. methodology/principal findings: we used multi-state capture-recapture models on 20 years of data to investigate the effect of rearing conditions on survival and recruitment in the cooperatively breeding seychelles warbler (acrocephalus sechellensis), with both helping and non-helping subordinates. the number of helpers in the rearing territory, but not territory quality, group-or brood size, was positively associated with survival of offspring in their first year, and later in life. this was not a result of group size itself since the number of non-helpers was not associated with offspring survival. furthermore, a nestling cross-foster experiment showed that the number of helpers on the pre-foster territory was not associated with offspring survival, indicating that offspring from territories with helpers do not differ in (genetic) quality. conclusions/significance: our results suggest that the presence of helpers not only increase survival of offspring in their first year of life, but also subsequent adult survival, and therefore have important fitness consequences later in life. this means that when calculating the fitness benefits of helping not only short-term but also the late-life benefits have to be taken into account to fully understand the evolution of cooperative breeding."

classical metapopulation theory as a useful paradigm for the conservation of an endangered amphibian,amphibian; metapopulation; occupancy; extinction; colonisation; connectivity,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,HEARD GW;SCROGGIE MP;MALONE BS,"classical metapopulation theory (cmt) has proven an attractive paradigm for ecologists concerned with the conservation of aquatic-breeding amphibians, given its apparent fit with the population dynamics of these animals, and the opportunities the concept provides to assess alternate management options. nevertheless, several authors have cautioned against uncritical application of this paradigm. we assessed the application of cmt to the conservation of the endangered growling grass frog (litoria raniformis) in the urbanising landscapes of melbourne, victoria, australia. support for five predictions developed from the basic tenets of cmt was assessed using a multi-year occupancy and mark-recapture data-set. there was congruence between all five predictions and data. wetland occupancy was strongly influenced by the proximity of neighbouring populations ('connectivity'), but the estimated rate of dispersal between wetlands was low. wetland occupancy was also temporally dynamic, with only a weak effect of connectivity on the probability of extinction, but a strong positive influence of connectivity on the probability of colonisation. our work confirms that cmt provides a useful model of the dynamics of l. raniformis in urbanising landscapes, and justifies the application of the paradigm to conservation planning for this species. we argue that cmt may prove relevant to numerous aquatic-breeding amphibians, and encourage assessment of the application of cmt to the conservation of these animals.

population and behavioural responses of native prey to alien predation,antechinus; bush rat; chemical cues; giving-up density; invasive predators,OECOLOGIA,KOVACS EK;CROWTHER MS;WEBB JK;DICKMAN CR,"the introduction of invasive alien predators often has catastrophic effects on populations of na < ve native prey, but in situations where prey survive the initial impact a predator may act as a strong selective agent for prey that can discriminate and avoid it. using two common species of australian small mammals that have persisted in the presence of an alien predator, the european red fox vulpes vulpes, for over a century, we hypothesised that populations of both would perform better where the activity of the predator was low than where it was high and that prey individuals would avoid signs of the predator's presence. we found no difference in prey abundance in sites with high and low fox activity, but survival of one species-the bush rat rattus fuscipes-was almost twofold higher where fox activity was low. juvenile, but not adult rats, avoided fox odour on traps, as did individuals of the second prey species, the brown antechinus, antechinus stuartii. both species also showed reduced activity at foraging trays bearing fox odour in giving-up density (gud) experiments, although guds and avoidance of fox odour declined over time. young rats avoided fox odour more strongly where fox activity was high than where it was low, but neither adult r. fuscipes nor a. stuartii responded differently to different levels of fox activity. conservation managers often attempt to eliminate alien predators or to protect predator-na < ve prey in protected reserves. our results suggest that, if predator pressure can be reduced, otherwise susceptible prey may survive the initial impact of an alien predator, and experience selection to discriminate cues to its presence and avoid it over the longer term. although predator reduction is often feasible, identifying the level of reduction that will conserve prey and allow selection for avoidance remains an important challenge."
estimating animal abundance in ground beef batches assayed with molecular markers,NA,PLOS ONE,HU XS;SIMILA J;PLATZ SS;MOORE SS;PLASTOW G;MEGHEN CN,"estimating animal abundance in industrial scale batches of ground meat is important for mapping meat products through the manufacturing process and for effectively tracing the finished product during a food safety recall. the processing of ground beef involves a potentially large number of animals from diverse sources in a single product batch, which produces a high heterogeneity in capture probability. in order to estimate animal abundance through dna profiling of ground beef constituents, two parameter-based statistical models were developed for incidence data. simulations were applied to evaluate the maximum likelihood estimate (mle) of a joint likelihood function from multiple surveys, showing superiority in the presence of high capture heterogeneity with small sample sizes, or comparable estimation in the presence of low capture heterogeneity with a large sample size when compared to other existing models. our model employs the full information on the pattern of the capture-recapture frequencies from multiple samples. we applied the proposed models to estimate animal abundance in six manufacturing beef batches, genotyped using 30 single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) markers, from a large scale beef grinding facility. results show that between 411 similar to 1367 animals were present in six manufacturing beef batches. these estimates are informative as a reference for improving recall processes and tracing finished meat products back to source."
modeling trap-awareness and related phenomena in capture-recapture studies,NA,PLOS ONE,PRADEL R;SANZ AGUILAR A,"trap-awareness and related phenomena whereby successive capture events are not independent is a feature of the majority of capture-recapture studies. this phenomenon was up to now difficult to incorporate in open population models and most authors have chosen to neglect it although this may have damaging consequences. focusing on the situation where animals exhibit a trap response at the occasion immediately following one where they have been trapped but revert to their original naive state if they are missed once, we show that trap-dependence is more naturally viewed as a state transition and is amenable to the current models of capture-recapture. this approach has the potential to accommodate lasting or progressively waning trap effects."
motorways and bird traffic casualties: carcasses surveys and scavenging bias,bird mortality; carcass persistence; survey biases; scavengers activity; motorways,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,GUINARD E;JULLIARD R;BARBRAUD C,"most survey methods developed to estimate abundance of killed animals on motorways may be biased due to the unequal detectability of carcasses, their persistence time on the lanes, and scavengers activities. unbiased surveys are needed to evaluate the relationships between bird casualties (mortality), motorways characteristics, and the neighbouring avifauna. the present study conducted on four motorways in france, aimed to evaluate factors affecting persistence and encounter probabilities and variations in scavenging activity to obtain unbiased estimates of bird traffic casualties. each motorway was surveyed once per season during multiple years and we used capture-recapture methods to estimate detection and carcass persistence rates. results showed that surveys by car were as efficient as surveys by foot in detecting carcasses on the pavement, but less efficient for carcasses on verges. passeriformes represented the most numerous casualties, and the barn owl (tyto alba) was the most frequently killed species. encounter probabilities were constant and high (0.957 +/- 0.007). average daily persistence probability was 0.976 +/- 0.003. persistence probabilities were higher for large and old carcasses, during summer, and differed between seasons, but were relatively similar between years. scavenging activities, estimated using experimental carcasses disposed on the safe lanes of motorways, varied between years, seasons, and differed between diurnal and nocturnal periods. a peak in scavenging activity occurred during diurnal periods in spring. results suggest that surveys must take into account carcass characteristics and seasonal variability to obtain unbiased estimates of road killed birds on motorways, as well as variation in scavenging rates.

variation in songbird migratory behavior offers clues about adaptability to environmental change,climate; departure; mark-recapture; passerine; stopover,OECOLOGIA,CALVERT AM;MACKENZIE SA;FLEMMING JM;TAYLOR PD;WALDE SJ,"for seasonally migrating birds, aspects of migratory behavior, such as the use of temperate versus tropical wintering areas, may influence their ability to respond to environmental change. here, we infer potential flexibility in songbird migration from variation in two alternative stopover behaviors. hierarchical bayesian mark-recapture modeling was used to quantify stopover decisions over 19 years for four temperate and four tropical migratory species at a stopover site in southern canada. short-distance temperate migrants exhibited higher variability in behavior and greater responses to local weather than longer-distance tropical migrants, as measured by transience (the proportion of birds stopping < 24 h, i.e. seeking brief sanctuary or subsequently relocating) and departure (re-initiation of migration by birds that stopped over for > 24 h). in contrast to many previous works on climate-migration associations, annual variation in stopover behavior did not show strong links to broad-scale climatic fluctuations for either temperate or tropical migrants, nor was there any indication of directional changes in stopover behavior over the past two decades. in addition to suggesting that migratory songbirds-particularly tropical-wintering species-may face increasing threats with future climatic variability, our study highlights the potential importance of flexibility in en-route behavior for resilience to environmental change."
from metamorphosis to maturity in complex life cycles: equal performance of different juvenile life history pathways,age-specific breeding probability; amphibian; cohort iteroparity; compensatory growth; complex life cycle; life history transition; maturity; metamorphosis; pelobates fuscus; sex-specific life histories; size; survival,ECOLOGY,SCHMIDT BR;HODL W;SCHAUB M,"performance in one stage of a complex life cycle may affect performance in the subsequent stage. animals that start a new stage at a smaller size than conspecifics may either always remain smaller or they may be able to ""catch up'' through plasticity, usually elevated growth rates. we study how size at and date of metamorphosis affected subsequent performance in the terrestrial juvenile stage and lifetime fitness of spadefoot toads (pelobates fuscus). we analyzed capture-recapture data of >3000 individuals sampled during nine years with mark-recapture models to estimate first-year juvenile survival probabilities and age-specific first-time breeding probabilities of toads, followed by model selection to assess whether these probabilities were correlated with size at and date of metamorphosis. males attained maturity after two years, whereas females reached maturity 2-4 years after metamorphosis. age at maturity was weakly correlated with metamorphic traits. in both sexes, first-year juvenile survival depended positively on date of metamorphosis and, in males, also negatively on size at metamorphosis. in males, toads that metamorphosed early at a small size had the highest probability to reach maturity. however, because very few toadlets metamorphosed early, the vast majority of male metamorphs had a very similar probability to reach maturity. a matrix projection model constructed for females showed that different juvenile life history pathways resulted in similar lifetime fitness. we found that the effects of date of and size at metamorphosis on different juvenile traits cancelled each other out such that toads that were small or large at metamorphosis had equal performance. because the costs and benefits of juvenile life history pathways may also depend on population fluctuations, ample phenotypic variation in life history traits may be maintained."

"woodland recovery after suppression of deer: cascade effects for small mammals, wood mice (apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (myodes glareolus)",NA,PLOS ONE,BUSH ER;BUESCHING CD;SLADE EM;MACDONALD DW,"over the past century, increases in both density and distribution of deer species in the northern hemisphere have resulted in major changes in ground flora and undergrowth vegetation of woodland habitats, and consequentially the animal communities that inhabit them. in this study, we tested whether recovery in the vegetative habitat of a woodland due to effective deer management (from a peak of 0.4-1.5 to <0.17 deer per ha) had translated to the small mammal community as an example of a higher order cascade effect. we compared deer-free exclosures with neighboring open woodland using capture-mark-recapture (cmr) methods to see if the significant difference in bank vole (myodes glareolus) and wood mouse (apodemus sylvaticus) numbers between these environments from 2001-2003 persisted in 2010. using the multi-state robust design method in program mark we found survival and abundance of both voles and mice to be equivalent between the open woodland and the experimental exclosures with no differences in various metrics of population structure (age structure, sex composition, reproductive activity) and individual fitness (weight), although the vole population showed variation both locally and temporally. this suggests that the vegetative habitat - having passed some threshold of complexity due to lowered deer density - has allowed recovery of the small mammal community, although patch dynamics associated with vegetation complexity still remain. we conclude that the response of small mammal communities to environmental disturbance such as intense browsing pressure can be rapidly reversed once the disturbing agent has been removed and the vegetative habitat is allowed to increase in density and complexity, although we encourage caution, as a source/sink dynamic may emerge between old growth patches and the recently disturbed habitat under harsh conditions."

effects of habitat disturbance on a peromyscus leucopus (rodentia: cricetidae) population in western pennsylvania,demography; density; disturbance; peromyscus leucopus; stability; suboptimal habitat; white-footed mouse,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,LINZEY AV;REED AW;SLADE NA;KESNER MH,"many species of wild mammals occur in habitats that have been disturbed by fragmentation or degraded in quality. previous researchers have hypothesized that demographic characteristics of populations may shift with changes in environmental conditions, with self-regulatory ability increasing with environmental suitability. we studied responses of white-footed mice (peromyscus leucopus) to habitat disturbance. given that optimal habitat for this species is deciduous woodland, we predicted that populations in habitats disturbed by cutting woody vegetation would be lower and more variable in density than in undisturbed habitat, density and stability of populations in disturbed habitat would increase over time, survival would be higher in undisturbed than in disturbed habitat, and populations in undisturbed habitat would show a greater degree of self-regulation. this 6-year study in western pennsylvania involved 3 replicated study sites (each 3.8 ha), with woody vegetation removed on half of each site prior to beginning the study. density in disturbed treatment averaged 65% of density in undisturbed habitat. there were no differences between treatments in survival or in population growth rates over time. population trends over time were similar between treatments, populations in disturbed habitat did not become more stable with time, and density did not converge with that of undisturbed habitat. although populations in the undisturbed habitat were clearly self-regulating, those in disturbed habitats were not. despite expectations that demographic performance will align with environmental suitability, it may be difficult to ascribe a particular demography to a habitat generalist such as p. leucopus."
effects of wind farms and food scarcity on a large scavenging bird species following an epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy,bovine spongiform encephalopathy; gyps fulvus; mortality; population model; rescue effect; scavenging birds; wind farms,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MARTINEZ ABRAIN A;TAVECCHIA G;REGAN HM;JIMENEZ J;SURROCA M;ORO D,"1. wind farms are emerging as a major cause of mortality of large scavenging bird species, which may be catastrophic when they operate in concert with other threats. as a study model, we examine the impact of wind turbines on the population dynamics of a soaring bird species, when acting in conjunction with a sudden decrease in food availability following the european bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) epidemic. 2. in spain, vultures have been provided with supplementary food at traditional vulture restaurants for centuries. in 2006/2007, these feeding stations were closed as part of disease control measures. at the same time, wind farms were deployed within the vulture foraging range. we used capture-recapture data and direct observation to monitor the impacts of these changes on the vulture population. 3. the number of breeding pairs decreased by c. 24%, adult survival by 30% and fecundity by 35%. however, the population recovered as soon as the perturbations ceased, the vulture restaurants were reopened, and the most problematic wind turbines were closed. population recovery was faster than predicted by a retrospective stochastic population model. 4. our analyses indicate that fecundity and survival were influenced predominantly by wind turbines. food scarcity promoted a shift in foraging behaviour that drove vultures to fly into the path of wind turbines as they sought out new food sources in a landfill site. elasticity and sensitivity analyses of the population model showed that mortality of adult birds had a much greater effect on population declines than mortality of immature birds, whereas reduction in fecundity had negligible effects. 5. the most likely explanation for the rapid recovery of the vulture population is that the observed decline in breeding pairs was not solely because of increased mortality. the decline probably included dispersal away from the area and a greater incidence of skipped breeding during the perturbation years. subsequent immigration from large nearby populations was probably a factor in population recovery. 6. synthesis and applications. where specific wind turbines are causing substantial mortality, their closure is an effective management response. for vulture populations dependent on supplemental feeding stations, the feeding sites should be relocated away from the most problematic wind turbines, or other anthropogenic sources of mortality, to prevent negative impacts. we recommend the establishment of scattered, low-value food sources to replicate historical conditions and to avoid the problems associated with high concentrations of individuals in one place."
modelling mortality causes in longitudinal data in the presence of tag loss: application to raptor poisoning and electrocution,capture-recapture; electrocution; multi-event; poisoning; radiotracking; red kite,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,TAVECCHIA G;ADROVER J;NAVARRO AM;PRADEL R,"1. a first step for the effective management of vulnerable populations is to identify population threats and measure their relative impact on population fluctuations. the relative importance of proximate causes of mortality can be calculated from longitudinal data using capturemarkrecapture models. if marks are lost or cease to function, survival is underestimated. 2. we provide an analytical framework based on conditional probabilities to obtain a robust estimate of the contribution of multiple sources of mortality while accounting for tag loss and imperfect detection. 3. we applied this approach to radiotracking and wing tags-resighting data of red kites milvus milvus to estimate the impact of illegal poisoning and the mortality by electrocution on power lines in the island of mallorca (spain). 4. illegal poisoning was responsible for 53% of the total mortality and electrocution on power lines for 12%. results indicated that poisoning-related mortality was higher in immature birds, probably due to their more wide-ranging prospective behaviour. 5. assuming the two human-related mortalities are additive, the survival probability of kites would increase by 17% (from 0.76 to 0.91) if both threats were removed. 6. synthesis and applications. we present a new approach to estimate the contribution of different sources of mortality accounting for tag loss, state uncertainty and detection failures in wildlife populations. our results will allow the demographic consequences of human-related mortality in threatened populations to be refined. the approach is suitable for the study of multiplicative latent processes in a vast range of applied conservation studies such as, for example, wildlife epidemiology."
detection probability in aerial surveys of feral horses,abundance; bias; equus caballus; observation error; population estimation; simultaneous double-count; visibility; wild horse,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,RANSOM JI,"observation bias pervades data collected during aerial surveys of large animals, and although some sources can be mitigated with informed planning, others must be addressed using valid sampling techniques that carefully model detection probability. nonetheless, aerial surveys are frequently employed to count large mammals without applying such methods to account for heterogeneity in visibility of animal groups on the landscape. this often leaves managers and interest groups at odds over decisions that are not adequately informed. i analyzed detection of feral horse (equus caballus) groups by dual independent observers from 24 fixed-wing and 16 helicopter flights using mixed-effect logistic regression models to investigate potential sources of observation bias. i accounted for observer skill, population location, and aircraft type in the model structure and analyzed the effects of group size, sun effect (position related to observer), vegetation type, topography, cloud cover, percent snow cover, and observer fatigue on detection of horse groups. the most important model-averaged effects for both fixed-wing and helicopter surveys included group size (fixed-wing: odds ratio?=?0.891, 95% ci?=?0.8500.935; helicopter: odds ratio?=?0.640, 95% ci?=?0.5870.698) and sun effect (fixed-wing: odds ratio?=?0.632, 95% ci?=?0.3501.141; helicopter: odds ratio?=?0.194, 95% ci?=?0.0800.470). observer fatigue was also an important effect in the best model for helicopter surveys, with detection probability declining after 3?hr of survey time (odds ratio?=?0.278, 95% ci?=?0.1440.537). biases arising from sun effect and observer fatigue can be mitigated by pre-flight survey design. other sources of bias, such as those arising from group size, topography, and vegetation can only be addressed by employing valid sampling techniques such as double sampling, markresight (batch-marked animals), markrecapture (uniquely marked and identifiable animals), sightability bias correction models, and line transect distance sampling; however, some of these techniques may still only partially correct for negative observation biases.

study design and mark-recapture estimates of dispersal: a case study with the endangered damselfly coenagrion mercuriale,damselfly; dispersal; dragonfly; mark-release-recapture; movement; study design,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,HASSALL C;THOMPSON DJ,"accurate data on dispersal ability are vital to the understanding of how species are affected by fragmented landscapes. however, three factors may limit the ability of field studies to detect a representative sample of dispersal events: (1) the number of individuals monitored, (2) the area over which the study is conducted and (3) the time over which the study is conducted. using sub-sampling of mark-release-recapture data from a study on the endangered damselfly coenagrion mercuriale (charpentier), we show that maximum dispersal distance is strongly related to the number of recaptured individuals in the mark-release-recapture study and the length of time over which the study is conducted. median dispersal distance is only related significantly to the length of the study. spatial extent is not associated with either dispersal measure in our analysis. previously consideration has been given to the spatial scale of dispersal experiments but we demonstrated conclusively that temporal scale and the number of marked individuals also have the potential to affect the measurement of dispersal. based on quadratic relationships between the maximum dispersal distance, recapture number and length of study, we conclude that a previous study was of sufficient scale to characterise the dispersal kernel of c. mercuriale. our method of analysis could be used to ensure that the results of mark-release-recapture studies are independent of levels of spatial and temporal investment. improved confidence in dispersal estimates will enable better management decisions to be made for endangered species."
human altered ecosystems: suitable habitats as well as ecological traps for dragonflies (odonata): the matter of scale,odonata; ecological traps; metapopulation dynamics; leucorrhinia pectoralis; habitat quality; secondary habitats,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,HARABIS F;DOLNY A,"habitat loss and degradation can be considered as major threats to freshwater invertebrates. these often irreversible processes lead to reduction of habitat patch quality and cause local extinctions of dragonflies, notably of habitat specialists. however, the biodiversity of specific secondary habitats is very high. here, we present findings from a 10-year study that intensively monitored odonate fauna in the upper silesian industrial coal region having many secondary habitats characterized by very frequent disturbances due to soil instability. we evaluated qualitative changes in the dragonfly assemblages on 10 patches using a modified dragonfly biotic index. data analysis was supplemented by a model examining population dynamics of the threatened dragonfly leucorrhinia pectoralis, using the capture-mark-recapture method, as an effective indicator of habitat quality. we show that dynamics of environmental conditions in secondary habitats are reflected in population dynamics of dragonfly populations and assemblages. as frequency of l. pectoralis population extinctions within the patch is considerable and independent of size and spatial isolation of single habitats, these can be regarded as ecological traps. nevertheless, the metapopulation dynamics may be a key adaptation of dragonflies to frequent freshwater habitat disturbances. we suggest that local extinctions are effectively balanced with (re-)colonization of newly emerging freshwater habitats. these findings have implications for potential conservation management of specific human-made habitats, because secondary habitats with a great diversity of succession stages arising directly as a consequence of environmental instability may be considered as partial alternatives to natural habitats in cultural landscapes."
high river temperature reduces survival of sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus nerka) approaching spawning grounds and exacerbates female mortality,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,MARTINS EG;HINCH SG;PATTERSON DA;HAGUE MJ;COOKE SJ;MILLER KM;ROBICHAUD D;ENGLISH KK;FARRELL AP,"recent studies have shown that warm temperatures reduce survival of adult migrating sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus nerka), but knowledge gaps exist on where high-temperature-related mortality occurs along the migration and whether females and males are differentially impacted by river temperature. in this study, we monitored 437 radio-tagged fraser river sockeye salmon and used capture-mark-recapture modelling approaches to investigate whether river thermal conditions differentially influence (i) spatial patterns of survival along a 413-km stretch of migration and (ii) survival of the sexes. regardless of water temperature, survival decreased in the river section containing the most hydraulically difficult passages of the migration. however, when water temperature was warm (19 degrees c), survival decreased even further in the final 186 km of the migration prior to reaching the spawning grounds, particularly in females. female and male survival differed but only when they experienced warm river temperatures. under such conditions, the overall freshwater migration survival of males was 1.6 times higher (0.79 +/- 0.09 standard error, se) than that of females (0.50 +/- 0.11 se). as maturing female sockeye salmon maintain higher levels of plasma cortisol compared with males, we suspect that females could be immuno-compromised and thus less resistant to pathogens whose rates of development are accelerated by warm temperatures."
a critique of density estimation from camera-trap data,abundance estimation; camera trap; capture-recapture; closed population model; density estimation,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,FOSTER RJ;HARMSEN BJ,"densities of elusive terrestrial mammals are commonly estimated from camera-trap data. typically, this is a 2-step process involving 1) fitting conventional closed population capturerecapture models to estimate abundance, and 2) using ad hoc methods to determine the effective trapping area. the methodology needs to be accurate, robust, and reliable when results are used to guide wildlife management. we critically review 47 published studies and discuss the problems associated with contemporary population estimates of elusive species from camera-trap data. in particular we discuss 1) individual identification, 2) sample size and capture probability, 3) camera location and spacing, 4) the size of the study area, and 5) ad hoc density estimation from the calculation of an effective trapping area. we also discuss the recently developed spatially explicit capturerecapture (secr) models as an alternative approach that does not require the intermediate step of estimating an effective trapping area. we recommend 1) greater transparency in study design and quality of the data, 2) greater rigor when reviewing manuscripts, and 3) that more attention is given to the survey design to ensure data are of sufficient quality for analysis.

a triple-isotope approach to predict the breeding origins of european bats,NA,PLOS ONE,POPA LISSEANU AG;SORGEL K;LUCKNER A;WASSENAAR LI;IBANEZ C;KRAMER SCHADT S;CIECHANOWSKI M;GORFOL T;NIERMANN I;BEUNEUX G;MYSLAJEK RW;JUSTE J;FONDERFLICK J;KELM DH;VOIGT CC,"despite a commitment by the european union to protect its migratory bat populations, conservation efforts are hindered by a poor understanding of bat migratory strategies and connectivity between breeding and wintering grounds. traditional methods like mark-recapture are ineffective to study broad-scale bat migratory patterns. stable hydrogen isotopes (delta d) have been proven useful in establishing spatial migratory connectivity of animal populations. before applying this tool, the method was calibrated using bat samples of known origin. here we established the potential of delta d as a robust geographical tracer of breeding origins of european bats by measuring delta d in hair of five sedentary bat species from 45 locations throughout europe. the delta d of bat hair strongly correlated with well-established spatial isotopic patterns in mean annual precipitation in europe, and therefore was highly correlated with latitude. we calculated a linear mixed-effects model, with species as random effect, linking delta d of bat hair to precipitation delta d of the areas of hair growth. this model can be used to predict breeding origins of european migrating bats. we used delta c-13 and delta n-15 to discriminate among potential origins of bats, and found that these isotopes can be used as variables to further refine origin predictions. a triple-isotope approach could thereby pinpoint populations or subpopulations that have distinct origins. our results further corroborated stable isotope analysis as a powerful method to delineate animal migrations in europe."
evidence for parr growth as a factor affecting parr-to-smolt survival,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,CONNOR WP;TIFFAN KF,"data collected on juvenile anadromous salmonids implanted with passive integrated transponder (pit) tags are used in mark-recapture analyses to understand the factors affecting survival of fish estimated between rearing in riverine habitat and dam passage. we estimated parr-to-smolt survival of pit-tagged naturally produced subyearling fall chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha to examine the previously unexplored influences of environmental and biological conditions measured prior to reservoir entry. mean (+/- se) parr-to-smolt survival of the early migrating cohorts was 45.4 +/- 6.3% (n = 13) compared with 37.4 +/- 4.7% (n = 13) for later migrating cohorts. annual mean parr-to-smolt survival differed widely across years ranging from a low of 9.6 +/- 0.5% (n = 2) in 2001 to a high of 81.7 +/- 4.6% (n = 2) in 1999. parr growth prior to reservoir entry and reservoir velocity provided the most information on variability in parr-to-smolt survival (n = 26, r-2 = 0.75, corrected akaike's information criterion [aic(c)] = -5.01). we suggest that parr growth and reservoir velocity were directly proportional to parr-to-smolt survival because fast growth and downstream movement reduces the time when fish are vulnerable to predators. the effect of reservoir velocity comports with previous published studies and supports management efforts to increase reservoir velocity. few if any published studies explicitly relate parr growth measured on individual fish to survival estimated for their cohorts in freshwater. this study provides empirical evidence that upholds the long-held belief that any anthropogenic activity that reduces growth of juvenile salmonids during freshwater rearing has the potential to reduce their survival."
estimating and predicting collection probability of fish at dams using multistate modeling,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,PLUMB JM;CONNOR WP;TIFFAN KF;MOFFITT CM;PERRY R;ADAMS NS,"dams can be equipped with a bypass that routes a portion of the fish that enter the turbine intakes away from the powerhouse into flumes, where they can be counted. daily passage abundance can be estimated by dividing the number of fish counted in the bypass by the sampling rate and then dividing the resulting quotient by the collection probability (i.e., the proportion of the fish population passing the dam that is bypassed). we used multistate mark-recapture modeling to evaluate six candidate models for predicting the collection probabilities of radio-tagged subyearling fall chinook salmon (n = 3,852) as a function of 1-2-d time periods (general model), four different combinations of outflow (i.e., the total volume of water passing the dam) and turbine allocation (i.e., the proportion of outflow directed through the turbines), and a null (intercept only) model. the best-fit model was the additive combination of turbine allocation and outflow, which explained 71% of the null deviance. cross validation of the best-fit model accounted for the variation that may arise from different data sets and the ensuing parameter values on the collection probability estimates and yielded a standard error of 0.613 that can be used to construct approximate 95% prediction intervals in nonstudy years. such estimates have been unavailable and will be useful anywhere estimates of daily passage abundance at dams with bypasses are needed to manage migratory fishes."
movement and capture efficiency of radio-tagged salmonids sampled by electrofishing,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,YOUNG MK;SCHMETTERLING DA,"electrofishing-based estimates of fish abundance are common. most population models assume that samples are drawn from a closed population, but population closure is sometimes difficult to achieve. consequently, we individually electrofished 103 radio-tagged trout of two species, westslope cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi and brook trout salvelinus fontinalis, in five streams in western montana to quantify the influence of habitat and fish size on capture efficiency and movement related to electrofishing with unpulsed dc. first-pass capture efficiency was 46% and declined on subsequent passes. no variables were related to capture efficiency, and only the percentage of cobble or larger substrate was related to the probability that uncaptured fish would move during the first electrofishing pass. about 20% of the uncaptured fish did not move, and 95% traveled less than 18 m. we concluded that for these streams, the bias in abundance estimates from disregarding movement would be relatively minor."
estimating escapement for a low-abundance steelhead population using dual-frequency identification sonar (didson),NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,PIPAL KA;NOTCH JJ;HAYES SA;ADAMS PB,"estimating the escapement of small populations of steelhead oncorhynchus mykiss (ocean-migrating rainbow trout) is challenging and requires innovative methods. difficulties arise from rare and episodic occurrence of individuals, high turbidity levels during migration, and the need to minimize jeopardy to the fish, which have led to a lack of population estimates, especially in california. here we show that dual-frequency identification sonar (didson) can be used to produce escapement estimates for a small steelhead population in scott creek, santa cruz county, california, with virtually no impact on the fish. the didson uses sound to form near-video quality images and passively monitors fish without the need to handle them or constrict passage. we deployed a didson and recorded steelhead passage over three spawning seasons (2008-2010). we used a decision support tool to analyze didson images and compared the resulting estimates (153, 57, and 84) with raw weir counts (50, 23, and 40), mark-recapture estimates (293 +/- 9, 126 +/- 12, and 109 +/- 34) generated over the entire migration period, and adjusted mark-recapture estimates (201, 74, and 85), which coincided with the period of didson deployment. the didson and weir estimates were restricted to a smaller sampling window due to the installation of downstream migrant traps causing increased incidences of milling fish that interfered with the didson results late in the migration season. the didson estimates were two to three times higher than weir estimates and 23% to 55% less than the full-season mark-recapture estimates. the adjusted mark-recapture estimates followed the same trends as the full-season mark-recapture estimates and were correlated with the didson estimates. we conclude that didson is an effective tool to generate steelhead escapement estimates, but it is important to collect data over the entire migration season and to consider fish behavior and potential species identification issues during analysis."
detection and stratification approaches for aerial surveys of deer in prairie-parklands,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,HABIB TJ;MOORE DA;MERRILL EH,"context. for management decisions that require accurate and precise estimates of large mammal population numbers, aerial surveys are considered reliable despite their cost. however, aerial surveys may still suffer from underestimation because of undetected animals and low precision as a result of inefficient sampling designs. aims. we assess detection of two species of deer in prairie-parkland communities of western canada and evaluate a suite of survey design features for improving the accuracy and precision of population estimates from aerial surveys. methods. modelling detection of deer was based on 100 sightability trials involving 54 radio-collared white-tailed and 46 mule deer. we used empirical survey data to simulate surveys under three alternative stratification approaches, schemes for grouping strata, and allocations of survey effort and compared the precision and accuracy of the resulting population estimates. key results. we observed deer in 83 of the 100 trials, with detection decreasing with small group size, reduced deer activity, low snow cover, high forest cover and observer fatigue. survey precision and accuracy were highest when stratification was based on natural breaks, calculated via jenks optimisation, in the values of resource-selection function (rsf), although improvement was less pronounced for estimates of mule deer abundance. optimal or equal allocation of sampling effort among strata outperformed proportional allocation of sampling effort. use of rsf for stratification reduced the coefficient of variation (cv) in estimates of deer numbers from 38% to 23% for white-tailed deer and from 33% to 27% for mule deer compared with past approaches. conclusions. stratification based on rsf values improved precision of deer surveys the most; however, using even simple measures related to habitat selection can improve population estimates. where deer are highly aggregated, reliably recording all variables needed to implement sightability models can prove problematic; however, survey detection adjustments are nevertheless important to account for the relatively small, but still significant, proportion of missed animals in open prairie-parkland environments. implications. field experiments to assess aerial survey design are impractical because of cost. we illustrate how simulated surveys using empirical data can be useful to evaluate alternative survey designs to improve population estimates in a region when high accuracy or precision are needed to address management questions or to calibrate more cost-effective approaches."
tag retention of t-bar anchor tags and passive integrated transponder tags in shovelnose sturgeon,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HAMEL MJ;HAMMEN JJ;PEGG MA,"capture-recapture methods are commonly used to estimate population parameters when the necessary assumptions are met. one of the broadest assumptions of capture-recapture models is that tags are not lost. therefore, one must understand tag retention to be able to adjust estimates if tag loss occurs. our objectives were to (1) determine retention rates of t-bar anchor tags and passive integrated transponder (pit) tags injected into the dorsal musculature of shovelnose sturgeon scaphirhynchus platorynchus and (2) determine whether using an alternative pit-tagging location (the operculum) and a new tagging procedure (cyanoacrylate [i.e., superglue] to seal the tag insertion point) provided higher retention. the t-bar tags had a retention rate of 100%; pit tag retention, however, was more variable. injection of pit tags along the dorsal fin resulted in a retention rate of 73%, and tag loss was observed throughout the 98-d experiment. the application of cyanoacrylate did not appear to deter pit tag loss; retention rates before and after cyanoacrylate was applied were 73% and 77%, respectively. further, we observed a similar trend of continual pit tag loss throughout the experiment. the operculum location resulted in a 92% pit tag retention rate and showed no trend in cumulative loss through time. the high retention rate of pit tags placed in the operculum suggests that this location is a reliable alternative to inserting pit tags along the dorsal fin of adult scaphirhynchus species. in addition, the excellent retention of t-bar tags makes them a viable option for use in scaphirhynchus studies."

population size of hatchery-reared and wild pallid sturgeon in the lower missouri river,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,STEFFENSEN KD;POWELL LA;PEGG MA,"the population size of pallid sturgeon scaphirhynchus albus is currently unknown throughout much of the missouri river. listed as federally endangered in 1990, the pallid sturgeon remains one of the rarest fishes in the missouri and mississippi river basins, and little to no natural recruitment occurs. artificial population supplementation via a hatchery propagation program was initiated, necessitating the collection of sexually mature pallid sturgeon. therefore, the nebraska game and parks commission maintained an intensive broodstock collection and mark-recapture effort from 2008 to 2010 to capture reproductively ready adults for the propagation program. coordinated crews fished baited trotlines from the confluence of the platte and missouri rivers at river kilometer (rkm) 957.6 to a point about 80.5 rkm downstream. a total of 438 pallid sturgeon were captured, which amounts to a 7.8% recapture rate. the objectives of the study were to (1) use these data to estimate the annual population sizes of wild-origin and hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon within the above-mentioned 80.5-rkm reach of the lower missouri river and (2) compare current population levels with the pallid sturgeon recovery team's population objective. we used the mark-recapture data in a robust-design analysis to derive population estimates and annual survival, capture, and temporary emigration rates. the annual population estimate for wild pallid sturgeon varied from 5.4 to 8.9 fish/rkm, whereas the estimate for known hatchery-reared fish varied from 28.6 to 32.3 fish/rkm. the robust-design approach to our analysis resulted in useful estimates of population size and other variables important to quantifying species recovery and management targets; the approach may be suitable for other fisheries management data sets."
"uncovering the secret lives of sewer rats (rattus norvegicus): movements, distribution and population dynamics revealed by a capture-mark-recapture study",NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,HEIBERG AC;SLUYDTS V;LEIRS H,"context. in many parts of the world, brown rats have colonised sewer systems and the rat populations in sewers are often thought to be a source of problems with rats on the surface. the management of sewer rat populations is usually performed with little, if any, knowledge of the dynamics and behaviour of these populations. aims. the study aimed to uncover the population dynamics, movements and distribution of rats in populations living in sewers. methods. we studied rats in a capture-mark-recapture study in two adjacent but separate sewer systems in suburban copenhagen, denmark, covering a surface area of 30 ha. multiple-capture live traps were placed in manholes in public sewers; animals were marked individually and data were collected every fourth week for a period of almost 3 years. key results. in total, 332 individual rats were trapped. approximately one-third were only caught once, half of these were juveniles. the median time an individual was present in the sewers was 4 months with maxima up to 22 months. abundance ranged from 2 to 44 animals per sewer system and the dynamics showed no regular fluctuations. rats were distributed throughout the study area, regardless of sewer dimensions. juvenile rats were captured more in the smaller and drier sewer sections. activity areas of rats of both sexes overlapped partially, and observations of bite wounds were rare, suggesting a high degree of tolerance. the average maximal distance covered by rats was similar to 200m for both sexes. day-to-day movements took place over shorter distances. there were no movements of rats between sewer systems and no sewer rats were observed to be active on the surface. the rat populations seemed to be substructured in smaller groups. conclusions. sewer rat populations vary irregularly in abundance. pipe dimensions are not important for the presence of rats but breeding seems concentrated in smaller and drier pipes. most individuals are resident and live in small groups that are active in a limited area only, but still there is a fair group of dispersing rats. implications. sewer rat management should be spread out spatially in a sewer system since most rats move over short areas only. recolonisation by dispersing rats must be taken into account if sewer systems are connected. it is likely that targeting smaller and drier pipes will affect reproductive success."
accounting for tag loss and its uncertainty in a mark-recapture study with a mixture of single and double tags,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HYUN SY;REYNOLDS JH;GALBREATH PF,"unless accounted for in the estimation, tag loss will cause mark-recapture methods to overestimate the true abundance of a closed population and to underestimate the associated uncertainty. current methods of accounting for tag loss require all marked individuals to be double-tagged. we present a new model that fully accounts for tag loss and allows for the use of a mixture of single-and double-tagged individuals, thus simplifying implementation in the field. treating abundance, tag loss rate, and capture probabilities as free parameters, we estimated those parameters and their uncertainty by using maximum likelihood. whereas existing methods assume that a double-tagged animal does not lose both tags, the new model allows the animal to lose both tags. the new model's performance was assessed and compared with that of other estimators (modified petersen and seber-felton) via simulation. as expected, estimates from the new model were less biased and more precise than estimates from the other models. the model was used to estimate the abundance of the kokanee oncorhynchus nerka population in the metolius river, oregon, during 2007. abundance was estimated at 102,970 fish ((se) over cap = 8,930), tag loss rate was estimated at 0.27 ((se) over cap =0.05), the capture probability for the first sample (tagging) was 0.03 ((se) over cap = 0.00), and the capture probability for the second sample (recovery) was 0.11 ((se) over cap = 0.01). the new model uses all of the information from single-and double-tag data, provides unbiased abundance estimates in the presence of tag loss for a closed population, and has less-stringent field requirements that make it easier to employ than other methods."
past and present processes influencing genetic diversity and effective population size in a natural population of atlantic sturgeon,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,MOYER GR;SWEKA JA;PETERSON DL,"threats such as habitat loss, invasive species, and overexploitation cause species extinctions; however, stochastic processes can accelerate extinction rates as census sizes decline. using molecular and ecological data, we explored the influence of these processes on the demography of a candidate species under the u. s. endangered species act-the atlantic sturgeon acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus. we used molecular microsatellite markers to estimate the effective population size (n-e) and effective number of breeders (n-b) and we used mark-recapture data to estimate the number of spawners (n-a) for atlantic sturgeon of the altamaha river, georgia. we found that estimates of n-b were 7-45% less than the estimated n-a over four consecutive cohorts and that skewed sex ratios could explain the relative decrease of n-b to n-a. our estimate of contemporary n-e was 125 (95% confidence interval = 75-348) and was at least an order of magnitude less than our estimate of historical n-e. to explain the large discrepancy between these estimates, we tested several alternative evolutionary scenarios that might explain the observed pattern of genetic diversity. our results indicated that the observed genetic data were indeed best explained (i.e., 0.998 posterior probability of the data given the hypothesis) by overexploitation during the last half of the 20th century."
bioenergetics and population dynamics of flannelmouth sucker and bluehead sucker in grand canyon as evidenced by tag recapture observations,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,WALTERS CJ;VAN POORTEN BT;COGGINS LG,"flannelmouth suckers catostomus latipinnus and bluehead suckers c. discolobus in the grand canyon of the colorado river are among the few native species to persist after river conditions changed with the completion of glen canyon dam in 1963. to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive management manipulations to the system for recovering native species, it is necessary to estimate basic demographic and population dynamic parameters for the species of interest, such as growth, mortality, and recruitment. with this in mind, we present a two-stage analysis in which we first estimated growth and individual ages using a field-based bioenergetics model and then input the age estimates into age-structured mark-recapture (asmr) models to estimate mortality and recruitment. the analysis was based on 18,500 flannelmouth suckers and 13,975 bluehead suckers that had been tagged with passive integrated transponder tags in the main-stem colorado river in grand canyon and its tributaries since 1989. the bioenergetics estimates of growth suggest that the growth of flannelmouth suckers is faster and that of bluehead suckers slower than in the tributaries reported in other studies. the results from the bioenergetics model provide necessary parameters for input into future ecosystem models. the asmr models that include the effects of age-specific gear vulnerability indicate that annual natural mortality rates are about 0.2 for flannelmouth suckers and 0.4 for bluehead suckers, which is in agreement with independent estimates from growth parameters and longevity. the estimates of age-1 sucker recruitment and adult abundance correspond well with independent electrofishing catch rate data. the estimated recruitment and abundance estimates provide insights into the efficacy of adaptive management actions targeted to benefit native fishes over the past two decades."
"effects of stocking catchable-sized hatchery rainbow trout on wild rainbow trout abundance, survival, growth, and recruitment",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,MEYER KA;HIGH B;ELLE FS,"the idaho department of fish and game has proactively dealt with the potential adverse genetic effects of stocking catchable-sized hatchery trout in waters that support native salmonids by adopting a policy in 2001 whereby only sterile rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss are stocked in flowing waters; however, concerns regarding the competitive effects of introducing hatchery trout into streams and rivers supporting wild trout have not been addressed. we stocked fish in the middle 3 years of a 5-year study to assess whether stocking hatchery rainbow trout of catchable size (hereafter, catchables) reduced the abundance, survival, growth, or recruitment of wild rainbow trout in streams. catchables averaging 249 mm total length (tl) were stocked from 2006 to 2008 at an annual density of 4.2 fish/100 m(2) into 12 treatment reaches of stream that were paired with control reaches at least 3 km apart in the same stream in which no stocking occurred. wild rainbow trout abundance (including all fish >= 75 mm tl), recruitment, survival, and growth were determined from population estimates and recaptures of fish tagged with passive integrated transponder (pit) tags during mark-recapture electrofishing sampling. the abundance of wild rainbow trout averaged 13.2 fish/100 m(2) but varied substantially across sites and years, ranging from a low of 0.5 to a high of 131.3 fish/100 m(2); similar variability was observed in recruitment to age 1. estimates of total annual survival averaged 0.53 based on the population abundance estimates (which allowed for emigration and immigration) and 0.26 based on the pit-tag recaptures (which allowed for emigration but not immigration). our paired study design demonstrated that the abundance, survival, growth, and recruitment to age 1 of wild rainbow trout were all unaffected by stocking catchables. the lack of population-level effects from stocking catchables was not surprising considering the high short-term mortality and the socially and physiologically naive behavior typically exhibited by hatchery catchables stocked in lotic systems."
"estimating pup production in a mammal with an extended and aseasonal breeding season, the australian sea lion (neophoca cinerea)",NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,MCINTOSH RR;GOLDSWORTHY SD;SHAUGHNESSY PD;KENNEDY CW;BURCH P,"context. the australian sea lion population at seal bay conservation park, south australia, was estimated to be declining at a rate of 1.14% per breeding season, on the basis of maximum counts of live pups in each of 13 breeding seasons (shaughnessy et al. 2006). the reliability of the pup-production estimates used to identify this decline is uncertain. aims. our aims were to obtain representative and repeatable estimates of pup production and to assess the current rate of decline. methods. we compared four estimates of pup abundance over five breeding seasons (2002-03, 2004, 2005-06, 2007, 2008-09), including the count of cumulative new births, the maximum live-pup count, the number of pups given passive integrated transponder (pit) tags, and mark-recapture methods using the petersen estimate. key results. a total of 90% of pup births occurred over a mean of 124 days (s.d. = 14). final estimates of pup production (from the largest of the four estimation methods used) in the five seasons were 227 (cl 221-239), 288 (cl 273-302), 219 (na), 260 (cl 254-272) and 268 (cl 268-269). the average estimate of pup mortality was 28.6% (s.d. = 6.3%). the decline in the population at seal bay over 17 breeding seasons on the basis of maximum counts of live pups was 0.51% per year or 0.76% per breeding season. however, this trend was not based on best estimates of pup production. on the basis of final estimates for the last five breeding seasons, there is no declining trend. conclusions. the count of cumulative new births was the most reliable measure of pup production; the petersen mark-recapture estimate provided a check for accuracy and confidence limits about the estimate. implications. the actual rate of change and the expected trajectory of the seal bay population remain uncertain. ongoing monitoring is a priority for this site, using the reliable methods of estimating pup production identified in the present study."
evidence for source-sink dynamics in a regional population of arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii plesius),habitat-specific demography; yukon urocitellus parryii plesius,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,DONKER SA;KREBS CJ,"context. variable demographic rates can manifest themselves between habitat types in the form of source-sink dynamics where populations in sink habitats would not exist without the addition of migrants from source habitats. aims. arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii pleisus (osgood, 1900)) occupy a large geographic area in northern canada and live in a variety of habitat types, including boreal forest, low-elevation meadows and alpine meadows, providing an opportunity to investigate the possible existence of source-sink dynamics. methods. we hypothesised that arctic ground squirrels in the south-western yukon exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of source-sink dynamics. boreal forest habitat could be a sink in spite of previous high squirrel densities, whereas meadows could be a source. we investigated this by mark-recapture live-trapping and radio-telemetry. key results. in the boreal forest in the kluane region, we found reduced recruitment, reduced population growth rates (l), and reduced survivorship for radio-collared individuals that moved from low-elevation meadows into the boreal forest. there was no evidence from radio-collared juveniles of dispersal from high-density ground squirrel populations in alpine meadows down into boreal forest. conclusions. boreal forest is a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. source-sink dynamics observed between low-elevation meadow and boreal forest habitats appear to result from increased predation pressure in the boreal forest. the result has been a near extirpation of boreal forest arctic ground squirrels in the kluane region since 1998. implications. because the source areas of low-elevation meadows occupy only 7-9% of the lowland habitat, recolonisation of boreal forest sites has been very slow. whereas alpine populations remain high in 2011, boreal forest populations remain near zero. alpine populations do not appear to be a source for the boreal forest."
post-fire succession affects abundance and survival but not detectability in a knob-tailed gecko,animal demography; fire regime; mark-recapture; reptile; reproduction; robust design,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,SMITH AL;BULL CM;DRISCOLL DA,"altered fire regimes threaten the persistence of many animal species globally, thus understanding how fire affects demographic processes is critical for conservation. using 2 years of mark-recapture data from the australian gecko nephrurus stellatus, we investigated the effect of fire on (i) detectability to reliably measure post-fire changes in abundance, and (ii) survival and reproductive rates to investigate the mechanisms of successional change. data were collected from two conservation reserves each with three different fire categories based on time since the last fire. ""early"", ""medium"" and ""late"" sites had 2-3, 7-9 and 42-48 years since fire, respectively. a robust design modelling framework was used to estimate the effect of fire category on abundance, survival and capture probability while also examining the influence of temperature and behaviour on detectability. geckos showed trap-shy behaviour and detectability increased significantly with increasing temperature but was not affected by time since fire. accounting for detectability, geckos were more abundant in the medium than the early sites, and were rare in the late sites. although trends in survival are more difficult to address with short-term data, our results showed lower monthly survival rates, but higher fecundity in the early than the medium sites. these results were possibly related to successional changes in predation, the thermal environment, and food availability. we demonstrated how mark-recapture analysis can show the causes of animal fire responses while realistically accounting for detectability. such information is necessary to provide a predictive framework to guide fire management for biodiversity.

optimising bait-station delivery of population-control agents to brushtail possums: field test of spatial model predictions,bovine tuberculosis; fertility vaccine; leghold trapping; marsupial; population monitoring; rtci; wildlife management,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,MONKS A;TOMPKINS DM,"context. low-volume control agents based on new biotechnologies are likely to be point-delivered to wildlife populations using devices such as bait stations. however, data and theory to underpin the development of strategies for such a use of bait stations are lacking. aims. in a large-scale replicated field trial of brushtail possum (trichosurus vulpecula) populations, we estimated the levels of coverage achieved with bait-station grids at three densities (0.2, 0.6 and 1.0 ha(-1)), with and without pre-feeding, to test the predictions of an existing model of bait-station delivery based on relationships derived from leghold trapping. methods. we first marked possums using conventional capture-mark-recapture techniques, and then estimated population coverage by recovering animals poisoned by encapsulated cyanide delivered by the bait stations. key results. the two key model predictions, that 90% population coverage could be achieved at 0.6 bait stations per hectare and that pre-feeding was not required to achieve this level, were not upheld by the field trials. instead, there was a poor fit between model predictions and observed levels of population coverage. an investigation of key model assumptions demonstrated issues with both model structure and parameterisation. conclusions. neither previously documented relationships for possum interactions with leghold traps, nor correlations between possum interaction rates with such devices and bait stations, are generically applicable across all populations. implications. while the existing model of bait-station delivery to possums fits the data for some field operations and trials, it is not applicable to all populations. incorporating habitat and seasonal effects on possum home-range behaviour could potentially improve model prediction. our results also have implications for the accuracy of index-based methods of possum population monitoring that use leghold traps, such as the residual trap catch index."
"overcoming hermit-crab interference during rodent-baiting operations: a case study from henderson island, south pacific",coenobitidae; conservation; eradication; islands; rats; rattus exulans,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,CUTHBERT RJ;BROOKE MD;TORR N,"context. rat (rattus spp.) eradication operations in the tropics are often put at risk by the presence of land crabs, in particular hermit crabs (coenobitidae), which consume toxic bait and thereby render it unavailable to rats. aims. we estimated hermit-crab densities in areas of high abundance, assessed crab bait consumption rates and determined the required baiting application rate to ensure that 100% of pacific rats (rattus exulans) consumed bait in areas with high crab densities on henderson island, south pacific. methods. crab densities and rat densities were estimated through distance sampling of crabs and mark-recapture of rats. non-toxic rhodamine-dyed cereal bait pellets were spread by hand at varying densities within four study plots and rats were captured 12 days later and examined for the presence of rhodamine biomarker dye. key results. crab densities (primarily coenobita perlatus) varied between beaches from 130 crabs ha(-1) to 1370 crabs ha(-1), with rats occurring at respective densities of 28 and 7 rats ha-1 on these beaches. estimated bait consumption rate of c. perlatus was 3.8 g crab(-1) day(-1). in total, 100% of rats were positive for rhodamine-dyed bait, despite the high densities of crabs present. conclusions. the results support the prospects for a successful rat eradication on henderson island, although careful consideration must be given to the potential impact of an eradication on non-target species. the estimated bait consumption rate by c. perlatus found in the present study may allow other eradication operations to make initial calculations of the required baiting densities to overcome interference from this species."
bayesian inference on age-specific survival for censored and truncated data,age-specific survival; bayesian inference; capture-recapture; recovery data; maximum likelihood,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,COLCHERO F;CLARK JS,"1. traditional estimation of age-specific survival and mortality rates in vertebrates is limited to individuals with known age. although this subject has been studied extensively using effective capturerecapture and capturerecovery models, inference remains challenging because of large numbers of incomplete records (i.e. unknown age of many individuals) and because of the inadequate duration of the studies. 2. here, we present a hierarchical model for capture-recapture/recovery (crr) data sets with large proportions of unknown times of birth and death. the model uses a bayesian framework to draw inference on population-level age-specific demographic rates using parametric survival functions and applies this information to reconstruct times of birth and death for individuals with unknown age. 3. we simulated a set of crr data sets with varying study span and proportions of individuals with known age, and varying recapture and recovery probabilities. we used these data sets to compare our method to a traditional crr model, which requires knowledge of individual ages. subsequently, we applied our method to a subset of a long-term crr data set on soay sheep. 4. our results show that this method performs better than the common crr model when sample sizes are low. still, our model is sensitive to the choice of priors with low recapture probability and short studies. in such cases, priors that overestimate survival perform better than those that underestimate it. also, the model was able to estimate accurately ages at death for soay sheep, with an average error of 0.94 years and to identify differences in mortality rate between sexes. 5. although many of the problems in the estimation of age-specific survival can be reduced through more efficient sampling schemes, most ecological data sets are still sparse and with a large proportion of missing records. thus, improved sampling needs still to be combined with statistical models capable of overcoming the unavoidable limitations of any fieldwork. we show that our approach provides reliable estimates of parameters and unknown times of birth and death even with the most incomplete data sets while being flexible enough to accommodate multiple recapture probabilities and covariates."
evaluating the demographic buffering hypothesis with vital rates estimated for weddell seals from 30 years of mark-recapture data,demography; environmental canalization; leptonychotes weddellii; marine mammal; pinniped; population dynamics,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,ROTELLA JJ;LINK WA;CHAMBERT T;STAUFFER GE;GARROTT RA,"1. life-history theory predicts that those vital rates that make larger contributions to population growth rate ought to be more strongly buffered against environmental variability than are those that are less important. despite the importance of the theory for predicting demographic responses to changes in the environment, it is not yet known how pervasive demographic buffering is in animal populations because the validity of most existing studies has been called into question because of methodological deficiencies. 2. we tested for demographic buffering in the southern-most breeding mammal population in the world using data collected from 5558 known-age female weddell seals over 30 years. we first estimated all vital rates simultaneously with mark-recapture analysis and then estimated process variance and covariance in those rates using a hierarchical bayesian approach. we next calculated the population growth rate's sensitivity to changes in each of the vital rates and tested for evidence of demographic buffering by comparing properly scaled values of sensitivity and process variance in vital rates. 3. we found evidence of positive process covariance between vital rates, which indicates that all vital rates are affected in the same direction by changes in annual environment. despite the positive correlations, we found strong evidence that demographic buffering occurred through reductions in variation in the vital rates to which population growth rate was most sensitive. process variation in vital rates was inversely related to sensitivity measures such that variation was greatest in breeding probabilities, intermediate for survival rates of young animals and lowest for survival rates of older animals. 4. our work contributes to a small but growing set of studies that have used rigorous methods on long-term, detailed data to investigate demographic responses to environmental variation. the information from these studies improves our understanding of life-history evolution in stochastic environments and provides useful information for predicting population responses to future environmental change. our results for an antarctic apex predator also provide useful baselines from a marine ecosystem when its top-and middle-trophic levels were not substantially impacted by human activity."

effect of search method and age class on mark-recapture parameter estimation in a population of red-backed salamanders,abundance; encounter probability; plethodon cinereus; program mark; recruitment,POPULATION ECOLOGY,BUDERMAN FE;LIEBGOLD EB,"mark-recapture methods are generally considered to more accurately reflect population trends than count data, which is especially important for indicator species. terrestrial salamanders are often used as indicators of forest ecosystem health and may be monitored through diurnal cover object searches or nocturnal activity searches. our goal was to determine whether search method affected encounter probabilities, whether these probabilities differed between age classes, and whether the inclusion of search method in mark-recapture models affected abundance estimates. we used program mark to analyze 3 years of red-backed salamander (plethodon cinereus) mark-recapture data using pollock's robust design taken from a 144 m(2) plot. initial encounter probabilities during night searches were consistently greater than during diurnal cover object searches. as a result, inclusion of search method in models sometimes affected abundance estimates. there was no difference between adult and juvenile encounter probabilities nor were abundance estimates affected by inclusion of age class, but there was yearly variation in the juvenile abundance estimates. for these reasons, we recommend that sampling of terrestrial salamanders include nocturnal activity searches and be conducted over multiple years. monitoring programs of other species should take into account whether the selected search method(s) may be more likely to sample different subsets of the population of interest and how this may restrict their inferences."
elevated surface temperature depresses survival of banner-tailed kangaroo rats: will climate change cook a desert icon?,biogeography; capture-recapture; heteromyidae; information theory; physiological limits; range shift,OECOLOGIA,MOSES MR;FREY JK;ROEMER GW,"modest increases in global temperature have been implicated in causing population extirpations and range shifts in taxa inhabiting colder environs and in ectotherms whose thermoregulation is more closely tied to environmental conditions. many arid-adapted endotherms already experience conditions at their physiological limits, so it is conceivable that they could be similarly affected by warming temperatures. we explored how climatic variables might influence the apparent survival of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (dipodomys spectabilis), a rodent endemic to the chihuahuan desert of north america and renowned for its behavioral and physiological adaptations to arid environments. relative variable weight, strength of variable relationships, and other criteria indicated that summer, diurnal land surface temperature (sd_lst) was the primary environmental driver of apparent survival in these arid-adapted rodents. higher temperatures had a negative effect on apparent survival, which ranged from 0.15 (se = 0.04) for subadults to 0.50 (se = 0.07) for adults. elevated sd_lst may negatively influence survival through multiple pathways, including increased water loss and energy expenditure that could lead to chronic stress and/or hyperthermia that could cause direct mortality. land surface temperatures are predicted to increase by as much 6.5a degrees c by 2099, reducing apparent survival of adults to similar to 0.15 in some regions of the species' range, possibly causing a shift in their distribution. the relationship between sd_lst and survival suggests a mechanism whereby physiological tolerances are exceeded resulting in a reduction to individual fitness that may ultimately cause a shift in the species' range over time."
short-term response of dicamptodon tenebrosus larvae to timber management in southwestern oregon,dicamptodon tenebrosus; forest management; mark-recapture; oregon; pacific giant salamander; stream amphibians,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,LEUTHOLD N;ADAMS MJ;HAYES JP,"in the pacific northwest, previous studies have found a negative effect of timber management on the abundance of stream amphibians, but results have been variable and region specific. these studies have generally used survey methods that did not account for differences in capture probability and focused on stands that were harvested under older management practices. we examined the influences of contemporary forest practices on larval dicamptodon tenebrosus as part of the hinkle creek paired watershed study. we used a markrecapture analysis to estimate d. tenebrosus density at 100 1-m sites spread throughout the basin and used extended linear models that accounted for correlation resulting from the repeated surveys at sites across years. density was associated with substrate, but we found no evidence of an effect of harvest. while holding other factors constant, the model-averaged estimates indicated; 1) each 10% increase in small cobble or larger substrate increased median density of d. tenebrosus 1.05 times, 2) each 100-ha increase in the upstream area drained decreased median density of d. tenebrosus 0.96 times, and 3) increasing the fish density in the 40 m around a site by 0.01 increased median salamander density 1.01 times. although this study took place in a single basin, it suggests that timber management in similar third-order basins of the southwestern oregon cascade foothills is unlikely to have short-term effects of d. tenebrosus larvae.

"leopard density in post-conflict landscape, cambodia: evidence from spatially explicit capture-recapture",cambodia; camera-trap; capture-recapture; density estimation; leopard; population recovery,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,GRAY TNE;PRUM S,"effective conservation of large carnivores requires reliable estimates of population density, often obtained through capturerecapture analysis, in order to prioritize investments and assess conservation intervention effectiveness. recent statistical advances and development of user-friendly software for spatially explicit capturerecapture (secr) circumvent the difficulties in estimating effective survey area, and hence density, from capturerecapture data. we conducted a camera-trapping study on leopards (panthera pardus) in mondulkiri protected forest, cambodia. we compared density estimates using secr with those obtained from conventional approaches in which the effective survey area is estimated using a boundary strip width based on observed animal movements. density estimates from chao heterogeneity models (3.8 +/- se 1.9 individuals/100 km2) and pledger heterogeneity models and models accounting for gender-specific capture and recapture rates (model-averaged density 3.9 +/- se 2.9 individuals/100 km2) were similar to those from secr in program density (3.6 +/- se 1.0/100 km2) but higher than estimates from jack-knife heterogeneity models (2.9 +/- se 0.9individuals/100 km2). capture probabilities differed between male and female leopards probably resulting from differences in the use of human-made trails between sexes. given that there are a number of biologically plausible reasons to expect gender-specific variation in capture probabilities of large carnivores, we recommend exploratory analysis of data using models in which gender can be included as a covariate affecting capture probabilities particularly given the demographic importance of breeding females for population recovery of threatened carnivores.

climate change is linked to long-term decline in a stream salamander,amphibian decline; climate change; demography; headwater stream; metamorphosis; salamander,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,LOWE WH,"amphibian declines have been documented worldwide and several have been linked to climate change, but the long-term data needed to detect declines are largely restricted to pond-breeding species. this limits our knowledge of population trends in other major groups of amphibians, including stream salamanders, which have their greatest diversity in north america. i hypothesized that increasing air temperature and precipitation in northeastern north america caused abundance of the stream salamander gyrinophilus porphyriticus in a new hampshire population to decline between 1999 and 2010. i found a significant decline in abundance of g. porphyriticus adults over this 12-year period, and no trend in larval abundance. adult abundance was negatively related to annual precipitation, which is predicted to increase further in the northeast due to climate change. analysis of a 6-year capture-mark-recapture data set for the same population showed no temporal variation in larval and adult detectability, validating the abundance data, and no variation in larval and adult survival. however, survival during metamorphosis from the larval to adult stage declined dramatically. these results suggest that increasing precipitation is causing a decline in adult recruitment, which, if it persists, will lead to local extinction. a likely mechanism for the decline in adult recruitment is mortality of metamorphosing individuals during spring and fall floods, which have increased in volume and frequency with the increase in precipitation. more broadly, this study presents strong evidence that the amphibian decline crisis extends to north america's stream salamanders, and shows the critical need to collect population data on these species.

lifetime fitness correlates of natal dispersal distance in a colonial bird,colonization; colony size; lifetime fitness; natal dispersal distance; survival,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,SERRANO D;TELLA JL,"1. obtaining empirical evidence of the consequences of dispersal distance on fitness is challenging in wild animals because long-term, unbiased data on reproduction, survival and movement are notoriously difficult to obtain. 2. lifetime fitness correlates of natal dispersal distance were studied in an isolated population of the facultatively colonial lesser kestrel falco naumanni (fleischer) monitored during 8 years at north-eastern spain, where most birds (83%) dispersed from their natal colony to settle at distances ranging from 112 m to 136.5 km. 3. neither annual breeding success nor age at recruitment was affected by natal dispersal distance. however, a capture-mark-recapture analysis revealed that survival during the year following recruitment decreased exponentially with dispersal distance, with differences of up to 15% between philopatrics and long-distance dispersers. in subsequent years, it remained similar irrespective of the natal dispersal distance moved. these results did not seem to be biased by long-distance dispersers settling differentially in the periphery of the population (which could emigrate permanently and be considered dead in future occasions) or within-individual consistency in successive dispersal distances, so our results appear to reflect genuine survival differences between dispersal tactics. 4. average lifetime fledgling production, average lifetime recruitment success and rate-sensitive individual fitness (kind) also decreased with the distance from the natal to the first-breeding colony, indicating that dispersal decisions early in life affecting immediate survival prospects may translate into long-term fitness costs. 5. both survival and lifetime fitness models including continuous dispersal distances significantly improved the characterization of the effect on fitness compared with models considering dispersal as a discrete process (i.e. dispersal vs. philopatry at a colony level). 6. long-distance dispersers were more likely to establish new colonies regardless of whether they recruited in the centre or the periphery of the population, revealing their important role in the colonization of unoccupied patches. individuals experienced a higher probability of mortality in small and newly funded colonies, so lifetime fitness costs of dispersal seem to be explained by recruitment in sites where average quality is low because of high uncertainty in survival prospects."
a meta-analysis of the traits affecting dispersal ability in butterflies: can wingspan be used as a proxy?,body size; dispersal ability in butterflies; phylogenetic generalized least squares (pgls); species-specific traits; wingspan as a proxy,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,SEKAR S,"1. dispersal ability of a species is a key ecological characteristic, affecting a range of processes from adaptation, community dynamics and genetic structure, to distribution and range size. it is determined by both intrinsic species traits and extrinsic landscape-related properties. 2. using butterflies as a model system, the following questions were addressed: (i) given similar extrinsic factors, which intrinsic species trait(s) explain dispersal ability? (ii) can one of these traits be used as a proxy for dispersal ability? (iii) the effect of interactions between the traits, and phylogenetic relatedness, on dispersal ability. 3. four data sets, using different measures of dispersal, were compiled from published literature. the first data set uses mean dispersal distances from capture-mark-recapture studies, and the other three use mobility indices. data for six traits that can potentially affect dispersal ability were collected: wingspan, larval host plant specificity, adult habitat specificity, mate location strategy, voltinism and flight period duration. each data set was subjected to both unifactorial, and multifactorial, phylogenetically controlled analyses. 4. among the factors considered, wingspan was the most important determinant of dispersal ability, although the predictive powers of regression models were low. voltinism and flight period duration also affect dispersal ability, especially in case of temperate species. interactions between the factors did not affect dispersal ability, and phylogenetic relatedness was significant in one data set. 5. while using wingspan as the only proxy for dispersal ability maybe problematic, it is usually the only easily accessible species-specific trait for a large number of species. it can thus be a satisfactory proxy when carefully interpreted, especially for analyses involving many species from all across the world."
estimation of tag shedding and reporting rates for lake erie jaw-tagged walleyes,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,VANDERGOOT CS;BRENDEN TO;THOMAS MV;EINHOUSE DW;COOK HA;TURNER MW,"since 1990, walleyes sander vitreus in lake erie have been tagged annually with jaw tags to better understand the population dynamics and ecological characteristics of individual spawning populations. although the data collected from this tagging program have been used for a variety of management purposes (e.g., estimating migration patterns, stock intermixing, and mortality rates), there has been only cursory examination of the shedding and reporting rates associated with the program. we used double tagging and high-reward tagging experiments to estimate tag shedding and reporting rates for jaw-tagged walleyes in lake erie. double tagging of walleyes with jaw and passive integrated transponder (pit) tags suggested that the tagging method and tagging agency contributed to the observed variability in both immediate (within 21 d of tagging) retention and chronic jaw tag shedding rates. agency-specific model-averaged estimates of immediate tag retention ranged from 95% to 99%. for chronic shedding, model-averaged instantaneous rates (annual) ranged from 0.07 to 0.28. jaw tag reporting rates, estimated via releases of high-reward tags in 1990 and 2000, varied among tagging years, tagging basins, and commercial and recreational fisheries. in general, tag reporting rates were higher for the recreational fishery (range, 33-55%) than for the commercial fishery (10-17%), and the reporting rates for both fisheries and tagging basins were found to have declined between 1990 and 2000. uncertainty in the tag reporting rates was greater for the recreational fishery than for the commercial fishery. our findings will benefit management of the economically important lake erie walleye fisheries by providing managers with robust tag shedding and reporting rate estimates, providing more reliable estimates of important dynamic rates (e.g., fishing and natural mortality) by correcting the long-term jaw tagging data set for these previously unaccounted for biases."
the relationship between age-0 walleye density and adult year-class strength across northern wisconsin,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HANSEN JF;FAYRAM AH;HENNESSY JM,"walleyes sander vitreus are an important cultural and economic resource in northern wisconsin, both as a recreational fishery and a tribal subsistence fishery. understanding the recruitment of age-0 walleyes to the adult population could be of great utility in effectively managing harvest and informing stocking efforts in this mixed-use fishery. our objective was to determine the relationship between abundance of age-0 walleyes in the fall and the subsequent adult year-class 4 years later and to explain additional residual variation related to environmental variables. since 1986, fall electrofishing surveys have been conducted to estimate the densities of age-0 walleyes and spring mark-recapture surveys to estimate spawning adult walleyes. we fit a gamma stock-recruitment curve to a data set of 104 paired surveys (age-0 survey with adult survey conducted 4 years later) on 58 lakes and attempted to explain residual variation related to additional environmental variables. our analysis suggests that the maximum number of age-4 fish (3.36/ha) is not produced by the maximum number of age-0 fish but by a somewhat intermediate density (243/ha) and that this relationship varies with the complexity of the shoreline. this density-dependent relationship should help managers refine models forecasting walleye abundance, as well as optimize stocking rates."
the demographic drivers of local population dynamics in two rare migratory birds,bayesian; correlation; demography; integrated population model; jynx torquilla; upupa epops,OECOLOGIA,SCHAUB M;REICHLIN TS;ABADI F;KERY M;JENNI L;ARLETTAZ R,"the exchange of individuals among populations can have strong effects on the dynamics and persistence of a given population. yet, estimation of immigration rates remains one of the greatest challenges for animal demographers. little empirical knowledge exists about the effects of immigration on population dynamics. new integrated population models fitted using bayesian methods enable simultaneous estimation of fecundity, survival and immigration, as well as the growth rate of a population of interest. we applied this novel analytical framework to the demography of two populations of long-distance migratory birds, hoopoe upupa epops and wryneck jynx torquilla, in a study area in south-western switzerland. during 2002-2010, the hoopoe population increased annually by 11%, while the wryneck population remained fairly stable. apparent juvenile and adult survival probability was nearly identical in both species, but fecundity and immigration were slightly higher in the hoopoe. hoopoe population growth rate was strongly correlated with juvenile survival, fecundity and immigration, while that of wrynecks strongly correlated only with immigration. this indicates that demographic components impacting the arrival of new individuals into the populations were more important for their dynamics than demographic components affecting the loss of individuals. the finding that immigration plays a crucial role in the population growth rates of these two rare species emphasizes the need for a broad rather than local perspective for population studies, and the development of wide-scale conservation actions."
inverse link between density and dispersal distance in butterflies: field evidence from six co-occurring species,animal movement; dispersal; landscape occupancy; lepidoptera; nymphalidae; population density,POPULATION ECOLOGY,KONVICKA M;ZIMMERMANN K;KLIMOVA M;HULA V;FRIC Z,"a pertinent question in animal population ecology is the relationship between population abundance, density, and mobility. two extreme ways to reach sufficient abundance for long-term persistence are to inhabit restricted locations at high densities, or large areas in low densities. the former case predicts low individual mobility, whereas the later predicts high one. this assumption is rarely tested using across-species comparisons, due to scarcity of data on both mobility and population sizes for multiple species. we used data on dispersal and local population densities of six butterfly species gained by mark-recapture, and data on their (relative) regional abundance obtained by walking transects in a landscape surrounding the mark-recapture sites. we correlated both local density and regional abundance against slopes of the inverse power function, appropriate for describing the shape of dispersal kernel. local densities correlated negatively with the dispersal kernel slopes both when sexes were treated as independent data points and if treated together. for regional abundance, the correlation was also negative but only marginally significant. our results corroborate the notion that a trade-off exists between living in dense populations and having poor dispersal, and vice versa. we link this observation to resource use by individual species, and distribution of such resources as host plants in the study landscape."
"changes in population abundance, reproduction and habitat use of the rice-field rat, rattus argentiventer, in relation to rice-crop growth stage in a lowland rice agroecosystem in vietnam",breeding female; female rat; movement; rice cover,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,MYPHUNG NT;BROWN PR;LEUNG LKP,"context. rice-field rodent pests cause substantial economic losses in asia. in vietnam, the rice-field rat (rattus argentiventer) causes 5-10% annual pre-harvest loss in rice yield. a sound ecological knowledge of this species would be useful for developing strategies for managing this pest. aims. we tested the hypotheses that there would be changes in the population abundance, breeding performance and habitat use of r. argentiventer in response to rice-crop growth stage. methods. capture-mark-recapture and kill trapping and spool-and-line tracking were used to assess population abundance, breeding and habitat use in different rice-bank habitats, at 3-5-week intervals, through a 2-month flooding period and a rice cropping season. the study was conducted between october 2008 and april 2009 in an giang province in the mekong delta, vietnam. key results. the population abundance of r. argentiventer was significantly related to rice-crop growth stage and rice-bank habitat. more rats were captured after harvest (p < 0.001) and more were captured in the large and medium-sized banks (p < 0.05). the breeding performance of adult females responded to rice-crop growth stage (p = 0.006). when rice cover was sparse, adult females were located in the burrows during the day, whereas when the cover became abundant, adult females remained in the fields during both the day and at night time. after harvest, rats returned to utilise burrows along rice-field banks. conclusions and implications. (1) rat control activities should be conducted prior to the seedling stage of the rice crop, before the onset of breeding and when vegetative cover is sparse, allowing the animals to be targeted in their burrows; and (2) vegetation on the rice-field banks should be cut to <10 cm to limit the availability of suitable nesting habitat in large and medium-sized banks."
can citizen science monitor whale-shark aggregations? investigating bias in mark-recapture modelling using identification photographs sourced from the public,abundance; flickr; photo-identification; online database; resight; survival; threatened species; youtube,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,DAVIES TK;STEVENS G;MEEKAN MG;STRUVE J;ROWCLIFFE JM,"context. the conservation status of the whale shark, rhincodon typus, remains uncertain. throughout their range, whale sharks are a focus for wildlife tourism and many identification photographs taken by tourists have become available online, presenting a potentially valuable source of data for monitoring populations using mark-recapture techniques. however, the suitability of these photographs for mark-recapture models has yet to be investigated. aims. we explore the suitability of identification-photographs available from online databases to produce assessments of life-history parameters and conservation status of whale sharks in the maldives. methods. to test the validity of using publically sourced images, we used photo-identification images collected from both experienced researchers and tourists between 2003 and 2008 to construct two databases. images taken by tourists were compiled from online databases. researcher and public databases were analysed separately and the results of mark-recapture models then compared. key results. the dataset constructed from online public databases did not violate the assumptions of mark-recapture modelling. estimates of parameters and abundance obtained from models using these data were similar to those produced using data provided by experienced researchers. conclusions. publically sourced data allowed for the accurate estimation of abundance of whale sharks. these estimates were not confounded by the suitability of photographs, probably because of the high encounter rate in the aggregation, the high residency rate of sharks and the retrospective nature of photo-identification, which limited heterogeneity in capture probability between marked and unmarked sharks. implications. our findings support the use of publically sourced data for use in mark-recapture studies of whale sharks, at least in situations where sharks are resident to the location. this approach will be useful in regions where data collected by tourists are available online, and research funding is limited."
estimation of population density by spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis of data from area searches,area search; bayesian analysis; data augmentation; flat-tailed horned lizard; maximum likelihood; polygons; population density; spatially explicit capture-recapture; transects,ECOLOGY,EFFORD MG,"the recent development of capture-recapture methods for estimating animal population density has focused on passive detection using devices such as traps or automatic cameras. some species lend themselves more to active searching: a polygonal plot may be searched repeatedly and the locations of detected individuals recorded, or a plot may be searched just once and multiple cues (feces or other sign) identified as belonging to particular individuals. this report presents new likelihood-based spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) methods for such data. the methods are shown to be at least as robust in simulations as an equivalent bayesian analysis, and to have negligible bias and near-nominal confidence interval coverage with parameter values from a lizard data set. it is recommended on the basis of simulation that plots for secr should be at least as large as the home range of the target species. the r package ""secr"" may be used to fit the models. the likelihood-based implementation extends the spatially explicit analyses available for search data to include binary data (animal detected or not detected on each occasion) or count data (multiple detections per occasion) from multiple irregular polygons, with or without dependence among polygons. it is also shown how the method may be adapted for detections along a linear transect."
modelling the local spread of invasive plants: importance of including spatial distribution and detectability in management plans,detectability; grassland; herbicide; invasive species control; lespedeza cuneata; plant spatial distribution; spatially explicit simulation model,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,EMRY DJ;ALEXANDER HM;TOURTELLOT MK,"1. the success of locally applied treatments for exotic weed control depends on the effectiveness of the method used and workers' abilities to find plants within infested sites. detectability of exotic plants, however, depends on aspects of a plant's spatial distribution such as the number and size of patches. we lack an explicit examination of how incomplete detection affects the spread of exotic weeds under a range of realistic field conditions. 2. we developed a model of spatial spread of the exotic plant, lespedeza cuneata, based on 3 years of data in a kansas, usa, grassland. we then expanded and generalized the model to study how treatment intensity, spatial distribution of stems and detectability influenced control efforts. 3. when left untreated, occupancy and abundance were higher with randomly distributed infestations than with patchy distributions. control treatments slowed spread, but only the most intense treatments reduced occupancy and abundance. 4. the greatest spread occurred when low detectability was accompanied with low treatment intensity because many small patches were not treated; this phenomenon was particularly common with random spatial distributions that initially lacked large, easily detectable patches. in contrast, high treatment intensity led to similarly slow spread for both spatial patterns and a range of detectability functions. 5. synthesis and applications. we developed a model to simultaneously manipulate the spatial distribution of the invading plant, the intensity of control methods used to manage the population and the detectability of occupied areas at a site; different combinations of these three factors led to very different rates of exotic spread. managers will reasonably try to implement intensive weed control. however, poor timing of treatments, for example, could lead to variation in treatment effectiveness. to maximize success, managers should explicitly consider detectability, especially where small patches are scattered throughout a site. to quantify the probability of detection, managers could perform multiple observer surveys; such information could help to determine the effort needed for effective control. creating weed maps may increase the detection of existing patches from year to year, but workers would still need to search the entire site for new or previously undetected patches."
"adelie penguin survival: age structure, temporal variability and environmental influences",survival; mark-recapture; mark; environmental influences; antarctica,OECOLOGIA,EMMERSON L;SOUTHWELL C,"the driving factors of survival, a key demographic process, have been particularly challenging to study, especially for winter migratory species such as the ad,lie penguin (pygoscelis adeliae). while winter environmental conditions clearly influence antarctic seabird survival, it has been unclear to which environmental features they are most likely to respond. here, we examine the influence of environmental fluctuations, broad climatic conditions and the success of the breeding season prior to winter on annual survival of an ad,lie penguin population using mark-recapture models based on penguin tag and resight data over a 16-year period. this analysis required an extension to the basic cormack-jolly-seber model by incorporating age structure in recapture and survival sub-models. by including model covariates, we show that survival of older penguins is primarily related to the amount and concentration of ice present in their winter foraging grounds. in contrast, fledgling and yearling survival depended on other factors in addition to the physical marine environment and outcomes of the previous breeding season, but we were unable to determine what these were. the relationship between sea-ice and survival differed with penguin age: extensive ice during the return journey to breeding colonies was detrimental to survival for the younger penguins, whereas either too little or too much ice (between 15 and 80% cover) in the winter foraging grounds was detrimental for adults. our results demonstrate that predictions of ad,lie penguin survival can be improved by taking into account penguin age, prior breeding conditions and environmental features."
"effects of prescribed fire, supplemental feeding, and mammalian predator exclusion on hispid cotton rat populations",demography; longleaf pine; multistate capture-mark-recapture models; population-level response to fire; sigmodon hispidus,OECOLOGIA,MORRIS G;HOSTETLER JA;CONNER LM;OLI MK,"predation and food resources can strongly affect small mammal population dynamics directly by altering vital rates or indirectly by influencing behaviors. fire may also strongly influence population dynamics of species inhabiting fire-adapted habitats because fire can alter food and cover availability. we used capture-mark-recapture and radio-telemetry studies to experimentally examine how supplemental feeding, mammalian predator exclusion, and prescribed fire affected survival, abundance, and reproduction of hispid cotton rats (sigmodon hispidus) in southwestern georgia, usa. prescribed fire reduced survival, abundance, and rates of transitions to reproductive states. food supplementation increased survival, transitions to reproductive states, and abundance, but was not sufficient to prevent post-fire declines in any of these parameters. mammalian predator exclusion did not strongly affect any of the considered parameters. our results show that fire strongly influenced cotton rat populations in our study site, primarily by reducing cover and increasing predation risk from non-mammalian predators."
population genetic structure and natal philopatry in the widespread north american bat myotis lucifugus,dispersal; philopatry; roost ecology; white-nose syndrome,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,DIXON MD,"molecular genetics tools have been used recently to investigate aspects of bat biology, including the degree of male- and female-driven gene flow among populations. however, none of this work has focused on the little brown bat (myotis lucifugus), one of the most common bats in north america. previous work using mark-recapture suggests that like many mammals, including other temperate vespertilionid bats, gene flow in this species is largely driven by males, whereas females return to the roosts in which they were born to rear pups. to determine if this species displays a pattern of population genetic structure that is consistent with this hypothesis i sampled 182 female m. lucifugus at 12 maternity colonies throughout minnesota. using a portion of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and 10 polymorphic nuclear microsatellites, i found significant structure among colonies, and population differentiation was slightly higher for the mitochondrial locus. this supports the hypothesis that female m. lucifugus display some degree of natal philopatry, but the inferred female dispersal rate was high. the pattern of structure was complex and demonstrates that unequal gene flow among maternity colonies is occurring and that the co-occurrence of breeding populations within maternity colonies and/or inbreeding could be confounding estimates of population genetic structure among these colonies. the patterns of population genetic structure and natal philopatry imply that both seasonal migration and dispersal by females should be considered as possible factors in the spread of emerging infectious diseases such as white-nose syndrome."
the spatial scale of competition from recruits on an older cohort in atlantic salmon,age structure; density dependence; exploitative; interactive; inter-cohort competition,OECOLOGIA,EINUM S;NISLOW KH;MCKELVEY S;ARMSTRONG JD,"competitive effects of younger cohorts on older ones are frequently assumed to be negligible in species where older, larger individuals dominate in pairwise behavioural interactions. here, we provide field estimates of such competition by recruits on an older age class in atlantic salmon (salmo salar), a species where observational studies have documented strong body size advantages which should favour older individuals in direct interactions. by creating realistic levels of spatial variation in the density of underyearling (yoy) recruits over a 1-km stretch of a stream, and obtaining accurate measurements of individual growth rates of overyearlings (parr) from capture-mark-recapture data on a fine spatial scale, we demonstrate that high yoy density can substantially decrease parr growth. models integrating multiple spatial scales indicated that parr were influenced by yoy density within 16 m. the preferred model suggested parr daily mass increase to be reduced by 39% when increasing yoy density from 0.0 to 1.0 m(-2), which is well within the range of naturally occurring densities. reduced juvenile growth rates will in general be expected to reduce juvenile survival (via increased length of exposure to freshwater mortality) and increase generation times (via increased age at seaward migrations). thus, increased recruitment can significantly affect the performance of older cohorts, with important implications for population dynamics. our results highlight that, even for the wide range of organisms that rely on defendable resources, the direction of competition among age classes cannot be assumed a priori or be inferred from behavioural observations alone."
evidence of metapopulation dynamics in shortnose sturgeon in the southern part of their range,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,PETERSON DL;FARRAE DJ,"the shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum is one of the most endangered members of the sturgeon family because of overexploitation, depressed population levels, and a shrinking range. the lack of historical data on shortnose sturgeon populations has led to an increase in sturgeon research over the last three decades; however, most recent studies have not focused on southern populations. the objective of this study was to estimate the abundance, annual survival, and temporary emigration rates of shortnose sturgeon in the ogeechee river, georgia. shortnose sturgeon were captured with gill and trammel nets for a mark-recapture analysis from 1 june to 31 august in each of the 3 years from 2007 to 2009. over the three summers of sampling, we conducted a total of 864 net sets and captured 168 individual shortnose sturgeon with an additional 51 recaptures. our analysis revealed that the best-fitting robust design population models incorporated interactions among water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and total effort in which capture and recapture probabilities were set equal and temporary emigration parameters were set to zero or held constant. abundance estimates (95% confidence interval [ci]) were 404 (175-633), 264 (126-402), and 203 (32-446) individual sturgeon for 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. population parameter estimates of annual survival and temporary emigration, combined with documented emigration and immigration of tagged individuals to and from the adjacent altamaha river, provided evidence that the ogeechee river stock is not discrete but possibly a metapopulation with the altamaha river."
method for estimating detection probabilities of nonmigrant tagged fish: applications for quantifying residualization rates,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,MELNYCHUK MC;HAUSCH SJ,"detection probabilities are commonly accounted for in spatial mark-recapture studies to estimate quantities of biological interest such as survival, movement, or abundance, but they generally require large numbers of tagged animals to be detected. in some studies, few tagged animals are present at a particular time; the ability to estimate detection probability despite small sample sizes during some time periods would greatly improve inferences of ecologically relevant attributes. we developed a method for estimating time-varying detection probabilities of tagged fish at acoustic or radio receiver stations during periods in which few tagged fish are present and mark-recapture methods are thus prohibitive. we quantified how an index of detection probability varies with an environmental covariate, and then calibrated this index against mark-recapture detection probability estimates derived from detection data collected when tagged fish were abundant. with a known time series of the environmental covariate, the method generates a time series of predicted detection probabilities for each receiver station in a study. we apply the method to a case study involving steelhead oncorhynchus mykiss smolts tagged with acoustic transmitters to estimate the proportion of tagged fish residualizing in a river (i.e., remaining in freshwater instead of migrating seaward). despite few detections of tagged fish in the months after the primary downstream migration period, we were able to estimate a residualization rate of 5% (95% confidence interval, 3-12%), which is comparable to residualization rate estimates from studies employing sampling methods that do not allow the survival and movement patterns of tagged fish to also be quantified. this method can be used in conjunction with mark-recapture survival estimation methods to better isolate probabilities of residualization and survival, which are otherwise confounded."
home range size and seasonal movement of juvenile lake sturgeon in a large river in the hudson bay drainage basin,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,BARTH CC;ANDERSON WG;HENDERSON LM;PEAKE SJ,"development of rehabilitation strategies and accurate assessment of anthropogenic impacts relies on a thorough understanding of a species' life history. in the case of the lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens, a better understanding of the juvenile life history stages is needed to improve conservation efforts for this imperiled species. home range size and seasonal movement of juvenile lake sturgeon in the winnipeg river, manitoba, were examined using mark-recapture and acoustic telemetry. over a 30-month period (may 2006-october 2008), 5,671 juvenile lake sturgeon (213-879 mm fork length [fl]) were marked with floy tags and the movements of 23 juvenile lake sturgeon (364505 mm fl) were monitored by means of acoustic transmitters. despite the potential for movement over 49 km of naturally connected riverine habitat, the results indicated that juvenile lake sturgeon exhibited strong site fidelity. as determined from the mark-recapture data set, 90.8% of recaptured fish were recaptured less than 2.0 river kilometers (rkm) from their original capture location. similarly, acoustic telemetry data indicated that 50% of the tagged fish moved 1.5 rkm or less from their initial release locations. finally, the results of both methodologies indicated that juvenile lake sturgeon rarely move through rapids characterized by high water velocities (>1.5 m/s), complex turbulent flows, boulder and bedrock substrates, and various cross-sectional water depths ranging from 1.0 m to approximately 15.0 m in either an upstream or downstream direction. these results suggest that the year-round habitat requirements for juvenile lake sturgeon can be met in relatively short sections of a large river. furthermore, owing to strong site fidelity and a lack of movement through rapids, macroscale habitat use in juvenile lake sturgeon occupying large rivers may be dependent on dispersal at either the larval or young of the year life history stages."
infection dynamics of endemic malaria in a wild bird population: parasite species-dependent drivers of spatial and temporal variation in transmission rates,avian malaria; blue tits; cyanistes caeruleus; disease incidence rate; environmental heterogeneity; host age; host sex; multievent mark-recapture models; plasmodium; transition rates,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,LACHISH S;KNOWLES SCL;ALVES R;WOOD MJ;SHELDON BC,"1. investigating the ecological context in which host-parasite interactions occur and the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in forcing infection dynamics is essential to understanding disease transmission, spread and maintenance. 2. despite their prominence as model host-pathogen systems, the relative influence of environmental heterogeneity and host characteristics in influencing the infection dynamics of avian blood parasites has rarely been assessed in the wild, particularly at a within-population scale. 3. we used a novel multievent modelling framework (an extension of multistate mark-recapture modelling) that allows for uncertainty in disease state, to estimate transmission parameters and assess variation in the infection dynamics of avian malaria in a large, longitudinally sampled data set of breeding blue tits infected with two divergent species of plasmodium parasites. 4. we found striking temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the disease incidence rate and the likelihood of recovery within this single population and demonstrate marked differences in the relative influence of environmental and host factors in forcing the infection dynamics of the two plasmodium species. 5. proximity to a permanent water source greatly influenced the transmission rates of p. circumflexum, but not of p. relictum, suggesting that these parasites are transmitted by different vectors. 6. host characteristics (age/sex) were found to influence infection rates but not recovery rates, and their influence on infection rates was also dependent on parasite species: p. relictum infection rates varied with host age, whilst p. circumflexum infection rates varied with host sex. 7. our analyses reveal that transmission of endemic avian malaria is a result of complex interactions between biotic and abiotic components that can operate on small spatial scales and demonstrate that knowledge of the drivers of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in disease transmission will be crucial for developing accurate epidemiological models and a thorough understanding of the evolutionary implications of pathogens."
evidence for positive density-dependent emigration in butterfly metapopulations,carrying capacity; dispersal; maculinea; mark-recapture; virtual migration model,OECOLOGIA,NOWICKI P;VRABEC V,"a positive effect of (meta)population density on emigration has been predicted by many theoretical models and confirmed empirically in various organisms. however, in butterflies, the most popular species for dispersal studies, the evidence for its existence has so far been equivocal, with negative relationships between density and emigration being reported more frequently. we analysed dispersal in sympatric metapopulations of two maculinea butterflies, intensively surveyed with mark-release-recapture methods for 7 years. dispersal parameters, derived using the virtual migration model, were assessed against butterfly densities, which fluctuated strongly over the study period. emigration was positively correlated with density, and this effect was particularly strong at densities above carrying capacity, when emigration increased up to threefold in females and twofold in males compared with the normal levels. in turn, density had little impact on other dispersal parameters analysed. our findings provide good evidence for positive density-dependence of emigration in butterflies. emigrating at high densities is particularly beneficial for females, because it gives them a chance to lay part of their egg-load in less crowded patches, where offspring survival is higher due to lower intraspecific competition. even though the rise in emigration becomes considerable at densities exceeding carrying capacity, i.e. relatively infrequently, it still has serious implications for many ecological phenomena, such as species range expansions, gene flow, and metapopulation persistence. consequently, instead of treating emigration as a fixed trait, it is worth allowing for its density-dependence in applications such as population viability analyses, genetic models or metapopulation models."
the island syndrome and population dynamics of introduced rats,body-size; demography; density; rattus rattus; spatially explicit capture-recapture,OECOLOGIA,RUSSELL JC;RINGLER D;TROMBINI A;LE CORRE M,"the island syndrome predicts directional changes in the morphology and demography of insular vertebrates, due to changes in trophic complexity and migration rates caused by island size and isolation. however, the high rate of human-mediated species introductions to some islands also increases trophic complexity, and this will reduce the perceived insularity on any such island. we test four hypotheses on the role of increased trophic complexity on the island syndrome, using introduced black rats (rattus rattus) on two isolated coral atolls in the mozambique channel. europa island has remained relatively pristine and insular, with few species introductions, whereas juan de nova island has had many species introductions, including predators and competitors of rats, anthropogenically increasing its trophic complexity. in the most insular environments, the island syndrome is expected to generate increases in body size and densities of rodents but decreases in the rates of reproduction and population cycling. morphology and reproduction were compared using linear regression and canonical discriminant analysis, while density and population cycling were compared using spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis. results were compared to other insular black rat populations in the mozambique channel and were consistent with predictions from the island syndrome. the manifestation of an island syndrome in rodents depends upon the trophic composition of a community, and may not relate to island size alone when many species additions, such as invasions, have occurred. the differing patterns of rodent population dynamics on each island provide information for future rodent eradication operations."
anticipation and tracking of pulsed resources drive population dynamics in eastern chipmunks,american beech; anticipatory reproduction; capture-mark-recapture; eastern chipmunk; fagus grandifolia; life-history trade-offs; masting; reproduction skipping; resource tracking; resource-consumer interactions; tamias striatus,ECOLOGY,BERGERON P;REALE D;HUMPHRIES MM;GARANT D,"pulsed systems are characterized by boom and bust cycles of resource production that are expected to cascade through multiple trophic levels. many of the consumers within pulsed resource systems have specific adaptations to cope with these cycles that may serve to either amplify or dampen their community-wide consequences. we monitored a seed predator, the eastern chipmunk (tamias striatus), in an american beech (fagus grandifolia) dominated forest, and used capture-mark-recapture analyses to estimate chipmunk vital rates and relate them to interannual variation in beech seed production. the summer activity and reproduction of adults anticipated autumn beech production, with high activity and intense reproduction occurring in summers prior to beech masts. chipmunks also reproduced every spring following a beech mast. however, adult survival was independent of beech production. in contrast, juvenile survival was lower in years of mast failure than in years of mast production, but their activity was consistently high and independent of beech production. population growth was strongly affected by the number of juveniles and therefore by beech seed production, which explains nearly 70% of variation in population growth. our results suggest that a combination of resource-dependent reproduction and variable activity levels associated with anticipation and response to resource pulses allows consumers to buffer potential deleterious effects of low food abundance on their survival."
fitness effects of endemic malaria infections in a wild bird population: the importance of ecological structure,avian malaria; plasmodium; blue tits (cyanistes caeruleus); host-parasite interactions; life-history trade-offs; multistate mark-recapture models,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,LACHISH S;KNOWLES SCL;ALVES R;WOOD MJ;SHELDON BC,"1. parasites can have important effects on host populations influencing either fecundity or mortality, but understanding the magnitude of these effects in endemic host-parasite systems is challenging and requires an understanding of ecological processes affecting both host and parasite. 2. avian blood parasites (haemoproteus and plasmodium) have been much studied, but the effects of these parasites on hosts in areas where they are endemic remains poorly known. 3. we used a multistate modelling framework to explore the effects of chronic infection with plasmodium on survival and recapture probability in a large data set of breeding blue tits, involving 3424 individuals and 3118 infection diagnoses over nine years. 4. we reveal strong associations between chronic malaria infection and both recapture and survival, effects that are dependent on the clade of parasite, on host traits and on the local risk of infection. 5. infection with plasmodium relictum was associated with reduced recapture probability and increased survival, compared to p. circumflexum, suggesting that these parasites have differing virulence and cause different types of selection on this host. 6. our results suggest a large potential survival cost of acute infections revealed by modelling host survival as a function of the local risk of infection. 7. our analyses suggest not only that endemic avian malaria may have multiple fitness effects on their hosts and that these effects are species dependent, but also that adding ecological structure (in this case parasite species and spatial variation in disease occurrence) to analyses of host-parasite interactions is an important step in understanding the ecology and evolution of these systems."
misleading population estimates: biases and consistency of visual surveys and matrix modelling in the endangered bearded vulture,NA,PLOS ONE,MARGALIDA A;ORO D;CORTES AVIZANDA A;HEREDIA R;DONAZAR JA,"conservation strategies for long-lived vertebrates require accurate estimates of parameters relative to the populations' size, numbers of non-breeding individuals (the ""cryptic"" fraction of the population) and the age structure. frequently, visual survey techniques are used to make these estimates but the accuracy of these approaches is questionable, mainly because of the existence of numerous potential biases. here we compare data on population trends and age structure in a bearded vulture (gypaetus barbatus) population from visual surveys performed at supplementary feeding stations with data derived from population matrix-modelling approximations. our results suggest that visual surveys overestimate the number of immature (<2 years old) birds, whereas subadults (3-5 y.o.) and adults (>6 y.o.) were underestimated in comparison with the predictions of a population model using a stable-age distribution. in addition, we found that visual surveys did not provide conclusive information on true variations in the size of the focal population. our results suggest that although long-term studies (i.e. population matrix modelling based on capture-recapture procedures) are a more time-consuming method, they provide more reliable and robust estimates of population parameters needed in designing and applying conservation strategies. the findings shown here are likely transferable to the management and conservation of other long-lived vertebrate populations that share similar life-history traits and ecological requirements."
intraspecific cache pilferage by larder-hoarding red squirrels (tamiasciurus hudsonicus),food cache; kleptoparasitism; larder-hoarding; midden; pilfering; red squirrels; stealing,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,DONALD JL;BOUTIN S,"although cases of pilfering food are reported commonly in the mammal literature, the factors affecting pilfering rates among individuals and between populations within the same species remain relatively unknown. we measured individual pilfering rates in 2 populations of highly territorial larder-hoarding red squirrels (tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in kluane, yukon, canada. one population received artificial food supplementation (where all individuals had ad libitum food) and had a 2-fold higher density than the control population. we knew the age, relatedness, and spatial relationship of all individuals in each population, and we had a measure of the food resources (cones) cached by each individual and their fates through the study. results from experimental removal of territory owners suggested that younger squirrels with smaller food caches were more likely to pilfer when provided the opportunity. however, using a mark-recapture study of marked spruce cones under natural conditions, we found that few individuals (14%) pilfered, and stolen cones represented only 0.3% of total cones that were larder-hoarded. pilfering occurs at a much lower rate in kluane than reported for red squirrels in other regions and is less than rates reported for scatter-hoarding species."
bayesian state-space model of fin whale abundance trends from a 1991-2008 time series of line-transect surveys in the california current,balaenoptera physalus; cetacean density; distance sampling; hierarchical modelling; multi-model inference,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MOORE JE;BARLOW J,"1. estimating temporal trends in animal abundance is central to ecology and conservation, but obtaining useful trend estimates is challenging when animal detection rates vary across surveys (e.g. because of differences in observers or conditions). methods exist for obtaining abundance estimates using capture-recapture and distance sampling protocols, but only recently have some of these been extended to allow direct estimation of abundance trends when detection rates vary. extensions to distance sampling for > 2 surveys have not yet been demonstrated. 2. we demonstrate a bayesian approach for estimating abundance and population trends, using a time series of line-transect data for endangered fin whales balaenoptera physalus off the west coast of the united states. we use a hierarchical model to partition state and observation processes. population density is modelled as a function of covariates and random process terms, while observed counts are modelled as an overdispersed poisson process with rates estimated as a function of population density and detection probability, which is modelled using distance sampling theory. we used deviance information criteria to make multi-model inference about abundance and trend estimates. 3. bayesian posterior distributions for trend parameters provide strong evidence of increasing fin whale abundance in the california current study area from 1991 to 2008, while individual abundance estimates during survey years were considerably more precise than previously reported estimates using the same data. assuming no change in underlying population dynamics, we predict continued increases in fin whale numbers over the next decade. our abundance projections account for both sampling error in parameter estimates and process variance in annual abundance about the mean trend. 4. synthesis and applications. bayesian hierarchical modelling offers numerous benefits for analysing animal abundance trends. in our case, these included its implicit handling of sampling covariance, flexibility to accommodate random effects and covariates, ability to compare trend models of different functional forms and ability to partition sampling and process error to make predictions. ultimately, by placing distance sampling within a more general hierarchical framework, we obtained more precise abundance estimates and an inference about fin whale trends that would have otherwise been difficult."
"demographic response to environmental variation in breeding, stopover and non-breeding areas in a migratory passerine",carry-over effect; demography; migration; ndvi; lanius collurio,OECOLOGIA,SCHAUB M;JAKOBER H;STAUBER W,"demographic rates of migratory species passing through several areas during their annual cycle may be affected by environmental conditions at each of these areas. recent studies provide evidence that their impact is not necessarily immediate, but can be delayed. we studied survival, reproductive success and arrival date at the breeding grounds of red-backed shrikes lanius collurio, a trans-saharan migrant, in relation to weather and vegetation on the breeding grounds, the stopover sites during migration and in the wintering areas. these environmental factors are used as proxy of the shrike's food supply. we analysed detailed demographic data of some 4,600 individuals from 25 years with multistate capture-recapture and mixed models. survival probabilities of juveniles and breeders of both sexes varied in parallel across time, suggesting that all cohorts were sensitive to similar causes of mortality. reproductive performance increased with temperature and decreased with rainfall on the breeding area. moreover, it increased with vegetation cover in the sahelian stopover area used on autumn migration suggesting a carry-over effect. arrival date was negatively affected by spring temperatures in the breeding area. hence, demographic rates were affected by environmental factors on the breeding grounds, but also outside and elsewhere. this suggests that the shrike's population dynamics are driven by environmental factors operating at various scales of space and time. however, only a small amount of the temporal variation in demographic rates is explained by the environmental factors considered, suggesting that additional factors, such as those operating during migration, might be important."
evaluating the importance of demographic connectivity in a marine metapopulation,demography; elasticity; larval dispersal; life-stage-simulation analysis; metapopulation; mytilus californianus; mytilus galloprovincialis; population connectivity,ECOLOGY,CARSON HS;COOK GS;LOPEZ DUARTE PC;LEVIN LA,"recently researchers have gone to great lengths to measure marine metapopulation connectivity via tagging, genetic, and trace-elemental fingerprinting studies. these empirical estimates of larval dispersal are key to assessing the significance of metapopulation connectivity within a demographic context, but the life-history data required to do this are rarely available. to evaluate the demographic consequences of connectivity we constructed seasonal, size-structured metapopulation matrix models for two species of mytilid mussel in san diego county, california, usa. the self-recruitment and larval exchange terms were produced from a time series of realized connectivities derived from trace-elemental fingerprinting of larval shells during spring and fall from 2003 to 2008. both species exhibited a strong seasonal pattern of southward movement of recruits in spring and northward movement in fall. growth and mortality terms were estimated using mark recapture data from representative sites for each species and subpopulation, and literature estimates of juvenile mortality. fecundity terms were estimated using county-wide settlement data from 2006-2008; these data reveal peak reproduction and recruitment in fall for mytilus californianus, and spring for m. galloprovincialis. elasticity and life-stage simulation analyses were employed to identify the season- and subpopulation-specific vital rates and connectivity terms to which the metapopulation growth rate (lambda) was most sensitive. for both species, metapopulation growth was most sensitive to proportional changes in adult fecundity, survival and growth of juvenile stages, and population connectivity, in order of importance, but relatively insensitive to adult growth or survival. the metapopulation concept was deemed appropriate for both mytilus species as exchange between the subpopulations was necessary for subpopulation persistence. however, highest metapopulation growth occurred in years when a greater proportion of recruits was retained within the predominant source subpopulation. despite differences in habitat and planktonic duration, both species exhibited similar overall metapopulation dynamics with respect to key life stages and processes. however, different peak reproductive periods in an environment of seasonal current reversals led to different regional (subpopulation) contributions to metapopulation maintenance; this result emphasizes the importance of connectivity analysis for spatial, management of coastal resources."
"genetic connectivity among populations of an endangered snake species from southeastern australia (hoplocephalus bungaroides, elapidae)",australia; conservation genetics; parentage analyses; reptile; elapidae; microsatellite loci,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,DUBEY S;SUMNER J;PIKE DA;KEOGH JS;WEBB JK;SHINE R,"for endangered species that persist as apparently isolated populations within a previously more extensive range, the degree of genetic exchange between those populations is critical to conservation and management. a lack of gene flow can exacerbate impacts of threatening processes and delay or prevent colonization of sites after local extirpation. the broad-headed snake, hoplocephalus bungaroides, is a small venomous species restricted to a handful of disjunct reserves near sydney, australia. mark-recapture studies have indicated low vagility for this ambush predator, suggesting that gene flow also may be low. however, our analyses of 11 microsatellite loci from 163 snakes collected in morton national park, from six sites within a 10-km diameter, suggest relatively high rates of gene flow among sites. most populations exchange genes with each other, with one large population serving as a source area and smaller populations apparently acting as sinks. about half of the juvenile snakes, for which we could reliably infer parentage, were collected from populations other than those in which we collected their putative parents. as expected from the snakes' reliance on rocky outcrops during cooler months of the year, most gene flow appears to be along sandstone plateaux rather than across the densely forested valleys that separate plateaux. the unexpectedly high rates of gene flow on a landscape scale are encouraging for future conservation of this endangered taxon. for example, wildlife managers could conserve broad-headed snakes by restoring habitats near extant source populations in areas predicted to be least affected by future climate change."

low individual-level dietary plasticity in an island-invasive generalist forager,alien invasive rodents; capture-mark-recapture; dietary shift; invasion success; resource use,POPULATION ECOLOGY,RUFFINO L;RUSSELL JC;PISANU B;CAUT S;VIDAL E,"the ability of invasive mammals to adjust their diet in response to new or variable resources is often proposed to explain their invasion success on islands with differing environmental conditions, especially islands with strong spatiotemporal changes in the nature and abundance of their resources. in this study, we investigated how habitat heterogeneity and seasonal fluctuation in resource quality affect dietary breadth and plasticity in an island-invasive rodent, the black rat rattus rattus, on a small mediterranean island. we tested for dietary plasticity of rats at both the individual and population levels by using traditional dietary and stable isotope analyses at successively increasing time scales, coupled with a long-term study of individual rats in three habitats of close proximity. dietary and movement analyses both indicated that r. rattus is able to exploit a wide range of resources and habitats. however, dietary plasticity and habitat breadth were far narrower at the individual level. results revealed that rats exclusively used resources found in their local habitat, and very few individuals moved among adjacent habitats in pursuit of higher-quality resources, despite those resources being abundant in their immediate environment. this counterintuitive finding suggests that intraspecific interactions must restrict rat mobility. our results suggest that even on small islands, accessibility of patchy and high-quality resources to individuals from the entire population is not systematic. this result has important implications when quantifying invasive rodent impacts on patchily distributed species, especially when studies use indirect methods such as dietary analyses as a substitute for direct observations of predatory behavior."
new insights on the management of wildlife diseases using multi-state recapture models: the case of classical swine fever in wild boar,NA,PLOS ONE,ROSSI S;TOIGO C;HARS J;POL F;HAMANN JL;DEPNER K;LE POTIER MF,"background: the understanding of host-parasite systems in wildlife is of increasing interest in relation to the risk of emerging diseases in livestock and humans. in this respect, many efforts have been dedicated to controlling classical swine fever (csf) in the european wild boar. but csf eradication has not always been achieved even though vaccination has been implemented at a large-scale. piglets have been assumed to be the main cause of csf persistence in the wild since they appeared to be more often infected and less often immune than older animals. however, this assumption emerged from laboratory trials or cross-sectional surveys based on the hunting bags. methodology/principal findings: in the present paper we conducted a capture-mark-recapture study in free-ranging wild boar piglets that experienced both csf infection and vaccination under natural conditions. we used multi-state capture recapture models to estimate the immunization and infection rates, and their variations according to the periods with or without vaccination. according to the model prediction, 80% of the infected piglets did not survive more than two weeks, while the other 20% quickly recovered. the probability of becoming immune did not increase significantly during the summer vaccination sessions, and the proportion of immune piglets was not higher after the autumn vaccination. conclusions/significance: given the high lethality of csf in piglets highlighted in our study, we consider unlikely that piglets could maintain the chain of csf virus transmission. our study also revealed the low efficacy of vaccination in piglets in summer and autumn, possibly due to the low palatability of baits to that age class, but also to the competition between baits and alternative food sources. based on this new information, we discuss the prospects for the improvement of csf control and the interest of the capture-recapture approach for improving the understanding of wildlife diseases."
prisoners in their habitat? generalist dispersal by habitat specialists: a case study in southern water vole (arvicola sapidus),NA,PLOS ONE,CENTENO CUADROS A;ROMAN J;DELIBES M;GODOY JA,"habitat specialists inhabiting scarce and scattered habitat patches pose interesting questions related to dispersal such as how specialized terrestrial mammals do to colonize distant patches crossing hostile matrices. we assess dispersal patterns of the southern water vole (arvicola sapidus), a habitat specialist whose habitat patches are distributed through less than 2% of the study area (overall 600 km(2)) and whose populations form a dynamic metapopulational network. we predict that individuals will require a high ability to move through the inhospitable matrix in order to avoid genetic and demographic isolations. genotypes (n = 142) for 10 microsatellites and sequences of the whole mitochondrial control region (n = 47) from seven localities revealed a weak but significant genetic structure partially explained by geographic distance. none of the landscape models had a significant effect on genetic structure over that of the euclidean distance alone and no evidence for efficient barriers to dispersal was found. contemporary gene flow was not severely limited for a. sapidus as shown by high migration rates estimates (>10%) between non-neighbouring areas. sex-biased dispersal tests did not support differences in dispersal rates, as shown by similar average axial parent-offspring distances, in close agreement with capture-mark-recapture estimates. as predicted, our results do not support any preferences of the species for specific landscape attributes on their dispersal pathways. here, we combine field and molecular data to illustrate how a habitat specialist mammal might disperse like a habitat generalist, acquiring specific long-distance dispersal strategies as an adaptation to patchy, naturally fragmented, heterogeneous and unstable habitats."

"survival of migrating atlantic salmon smolts through the penobscot river, maine: a prerestoration assessment",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HOLBROOK CM;KINNISON MT;ZYDLEWSKI J,"survival, distribution, and behavior of hatchery (n = 493) and naturally reared (n = 133) smolts of atlantic salmon salmo salar migrating through the penobscot river and estuary in maine were evaluated with acoustic telemetry in 2005 and 2006. survival and use of a secondary migration path (the stillwater branch) were estimated with a multistate mark-recapture model. higher rates of mortality per kilometer (range = 0.01-0.22) were observed near release sites and within reaches that contained three particular dams: howland, west enfield, and milford dams. estimated total survival of tagged hatchery smolts through entire individual reaches containing those dams ranged from 0.52 (se = 0.18) to 0.94 (se = 0.09), whereas survival through most of the reaches without dams exceeded 0.95. of those smolts that survived to the penobscot river-stillwater branch split at marsh island, most (>= 74%) remained in the main stem around marsh island, where they experienced lower survival than fish that used the stillwater branch. movement rates of hatchery-reared smolts were significantly lower through reaches containing dams than through reaches that lacked dams. smolts arriving at dams during the day experienced longer delays than smolts arriving at night. planned removal of two dams in this system is expected to enhance the passage of smolts through the main-stem corridor. however, the dams currently scheduled for removal (great works and veazie dams) had less influence on smolt survival than some of the dams that will remain. this case study shows that by examining prerestoration migration dynamics throughout entire river systems rather than just in the vicinity of particular dams, tracking studies can help prioritize restoration efforts or predict the costs and benefits of future hydrosystem changes."
factors affecting detection probability of burrowing owls in southwest agroecosystem environments,agroecosystem; activity center; athene cunicularia; availability for detection; burrowing owl; detection probability; monitoring; population estimation; survey methods,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,MANNING JA,"estimating range-wide population trends of western burrowing owls (athene cunicularia) requires standardized survey protocols that correct for detection bias in environments that support large owl populations. high concentrations of owls exist in irrigated agroecosystems within the southwest united states, yet little is known about the factors that affect detection bias during owl surveys in these systems. i used closed-population capture-recapture models to evaluate 4 factors that could affect the probability of a surveyor detecting an owl activity center (i.e., nest burrow) during visual surveys where owls are the focal object and analyzed the relationship (linear or curvilinear) between specific factors and detection probability. i recorded 1,199 detections of owls from 132 capture-recapture surveys within 12 sites of the imperial valley agroecosystem in california, usa between 16 april and 20 may 2006. i also conducted 96 time budget surveys throughout the day and used mixed linear models to evaluate the effect of each factor on probability of an owl activity center being available for detection (i.e., >= 1 owls above ground) during surveys. model selection results indicated that detection probability was influenced by ambient air temperature interacting with wind speed. detection probability followed a curvilinear relationship that resembled bell-shaped curve along a temperature gradient, with the maximum detection probability shifting as a function of wind speed. at low temperatures, detection probability declined with increased wind speed, but this relationship was reversed at high temperatures, producing a 3-dimensional pattern in detection probability characterized by a saddle-shaped hyperbolic paraboloid response surface. the probability of an activity center being available for detection declined curvilinearly with increased temperature and explained 51% of the variation in detection probability. given the broad range of detection probabilities, correcting visual survey counts for detection bias is necessary for comparing population estimates among regions and through time. survey designs intended to estimate abundance of owls in southwest agroecosystems should incorporate methods to estimate and correct for variation in detection probability that include measurements of ambient temperature and wind speed for use as covariates.

suburbs: dangers or drought refugia for freshwater turtle populations?,australia; chelodina longicollis; ecological trap; estivation; herpetofauna; population demographics; population sink; reptile; road mortality; urbanization,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,ROE JH;REES M;GEORGES A,"urbanization is one of the most rapidly expanding forms of habitat alteration worldwide. wildlife differs in their responses to urbanization depending upon species and site-specific factors. we used capture-mark-recapture to examine the abundance, population demographics, growth, and movements of the eastern long-necked turtle (chelodina longicollis) in australia over 1 year in a suburban environment and an adjacent nature reserve during drought. contrary to expectations, sex ratios, injury incidence, and frequency of juvenile size classes did not differ between turtles in the suburbs and the nature reserve. moreover, turtles in the suburbs were nearly 3 times more abundant, grew 5 times faster, and had populations comprised of more adults in the larger size classes than nature reserve populations. these findings, together with net movements from the nature reserves into the suburbs, suggest that suburban water bodies were the higher quality habitat, effectively buffering turtles from temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions during drought. however, reserve managers and urban planners need to recognize that suburban water bodies have the potential to attract turtles from nearby reserves during drought, and that even low levels of persistent mortality during these travels across reserve boundaries may have consequences for populations of long-lived vertebrates.

river otter population size estimation using noninvasive latrine surveys,fecal dna; lontra canadensis; microsatellites; missouri; nearctic river otter; noninvasive genetic sampling,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,MOWRY RA;GOMPPER ME;BERINGER J;EGGERT LS,"across much of north america, river otter (lontra canadensis) populations were extirpated or greatly reduced by the early 20th century. more recently, reintroductions have resulted in restored populations and the recommencement of managed trapping. perhaps the best example of these river otter reintroductions occurred in missouri, regarded as one of the most successful carnivore recovery programs in history. however, abundance estimates for river otter populations are difficult to obtain and often contentious when used to underpin management activities. we assessed the value of latrine site monitoring as a mechanism for quantifying river otter abundance. analyses of fecal dna to identify individual animals may result in an improved population estimate and have been used for a variety of mammal species. we optimized laboratory protocols, redesigned existing microsatellite primers, and calculated genotyping error rates to enhance genotyping success for a large quantity of river otter scat samples. we also developed a method for molecular sexing. we then extracted dna from 1,421 scat samples and anal sac secretions (anal jelly) collected during latrine site counts along 22-34-km stretches representing 8-77% of 8 rivers in southern missouri in 2009. error rates were low for the redesigned microsatellites. we obtained genotypes at 7-10 microsatellite loci for 24% of samples, observing highest success for anal jelly samples (71%) and lowest for fresh samples (collected within 1 day of defecation). we identified 63 otters (41 m, 22 f) in the 8 rivers, ranging from 2 to 14 otters per river. analyses using program capwire resulted in population estimates similar to the minimum genotyping estimate. density estimates averaged 0.24 otters/km. we used linear regression to develop and contrast models predicting population size based on latrine site and scat count indices, which are easily collected in the field. population size was best predicted by a combination of scats per latrine and latrines per kilometer. our results provide methodological approaches to guide wildlife managers seeking to initiate similar river otter fecal genotyping studies, as well as to estimate and monitor river otter population sizes.

is the yelkouan shearwater puffinus yelkouan threatened by low adult survival probabilities?,fishery by-catch; population model; seabird; introduced predator; multi-state model; mediterranean; shooting,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,OPPEL S;RAINE AF;BORG JJ;RAINE H;BONNAUD E;BOURGEOIS K;BRETON AR,"many seabird species are experiencing population declines, with key factors being high adult mortality caused by fishery by-catch and predation by introduced predators on nesting islands. in the mediterranean, both of these pressures are intensive and widespread. we studied the adult survival of an endemic mediterranean seabird, the yelkouan shearwater (puffinus yelkouan), between 1969-1994 and 2007-2010 in malta and between 2004-2010 in france using mark-recapture methods. mean annual survival probabilities for breeding adults were below 0.9 for all colonies and periods. between 1969-1994, annual survival for adults of unknown breeding status was on average 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.80) in malta, possibly as a result of various human disturbances (including illegal shooting), light pollution and fisheries by-catch. over the period 2004-2010, we found strong support for variation in adult survival probabilities between breeders and non-breeders, and islands with and without introduced predators in france. survival probabilities for non-breeders (0.95, 0.81-1.0) appeared to be higher than for breeders (0.82, 0.70-0.94), but were imprecise partly due to low recapture probabilities. in malta, we found evidence for heterogeneity in survival probabilities between two unknown groups (probably breeders and non-breeders), and seasonal variation in survival probability. birds were more likely to survive the period including the peak breeding season than an equally long period during which they roam widely at sea. although annual adult survival probability was still low (0.85, 0.58-1.0), colony protection measures appear to have reduced mortality at nesting cliffs. a population model indicated that colonies in france and malta would currently require continuous immigration of 5-12 pairs per year to maintain stable populations. our estimates of adult survival probabilities over the past four decades are consistent with overall population declines. threats to yelkouan shearwaters require immediate management actions to avoid ongoing population declines in the western mediterranean.

movements and survival of black-footed ferrets associated with an experimental translocation in south dakota,behavior; captive breeding; compensatory mortality; density dependence; dispersal; endangered species; mustela nigripes; reintroduction,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,BIGGINS DE;GODBEY JL;HORTON BM;LIVIERI TM,"black-footed ferrets (mustela nigripes) apparently were extirpated from all native habitats by 1987, and their repatriation requires a combination of captive breeding, reintroductions, and translocations among sites. improvements in survival rates of released ferrets have resulted from experience in quasi-natural environments during their rearing. reestablishment of a self-sustaining wild population by 1999 provided the 1st opportunity to initiate new populations by translocating wild-born individuals. using radiotelemetry, we compared behaviors and survival of 18 translocated wild-born ferrets and 18 pen-experienced captive-born ferrets after their release into a prairie dog colony not occupied previously by ferrets. translocated wild-born ferrets moved significantly less and had significantly higher short-term survival rates than their captive-born counterparts. using mark recapture methods, we also assessed potential impacts to the established donor population of removing 37% of its estimated annual production of kits. annual survival rates for 30 ferret kits remaining at the donor subcomplex were higher than rates for 54 ferret kits at the control subcomplex (unmanipulated) for males (+82%) and females (+32%). minimum survival of translocated kits did not differ significantly from survival of those at the control subcomplex. direct translocation of young, wild-born ferrets from site to site appears to be an efficient method to establish new populations."
comparison of noninvasive genetic and camera-trapping techniques for surveying snow leopards,abundance; gobi desert; microsatellites; mongolia; monitoring; panthera uncia; population survey; scat,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,JANECKA JE;MUNKHTSOG B;JACKSON RM;NARANBAATAR G;MALLON DP;MURPHY WJ,"the endangered snow leopard (panthera uncia) is widely but sparsely distributed throughout the mountainous regions of central asia. detailed information on the status and abundance of the snow leopard is limited because of the logistical challenges faced when working in the rugged terrain it occupies, along with its secretive nature. camera-trapping and noninvasive genetic techniques have been used successfully to survey this fetid. we compared noninvasive genetic and camera-trapping snow leopard surveys in the gobi desert of mongolia. we collected 180 putative snow leopard scats from 3 sites during an 8-day period along 37.74 km of transects. we then conducted a 65-day photographic survey at i of these sites, approximately 2 months after scat collection. in the site where both techniques were used noninvasive genetics detected 5 individuals in only 2 days of fieldwork compared to 7 individuals observed in the 65-day camera-trapping session. estimates of population size from noninvasive genetics ranged between 16 and 19 snow leopards in the 314.3-km(2) area surveyed, yielding densities of 4.9-5.9 individuals/100 km(2). in comparison, the population estimate from the 65-day photographic survey was 4 individuals (adults only) within the 264-km(2) area, for a density estimate of 1.5 snow leopards/100 km(2). higher density estimates from the noninvasive genetic survey were due partly to an inability to determine age and exclude subadults, reduced spatial distribution of sampling points as a consequence of collecting scats along linear transects, and deposition of scats by multiple snow leopards on common sites. resulting differences could inflate abundance estimated from noninvasive genetic surveys and prevent direct comparison of densities derived from the 2 approaches unless appropriate adjustments are made to the study design."

long-term population dynamics of a managed burrowing owl colony,airport; athene cunicularia; burrowing owl; california; demography; life table response experiment; mark recapture; population dynamics; survival,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BARCLAY JH;KORFANTA NM;KAUFFMAN MJ,"we analyzed the population dynamics of a burrowing owl (athene cunicularia) colony at mineta san jose international airport in san jose, california, usa from 1990-2007. this colony was managed by using artificial burrows to reduce the occurrence of nesting owls along runways and within major airport improvement projects during the study period. we estimated annual reproduction in natural and artificial burrows and age-specific survival rates with mark-recapture techniques, and we estimated the relative contribution of these vital rates to population dynamics using a life table response experiment. the breeding colony showed 2 distinct periods of change: high population growth from 7 nesting pairs in 1991 to 40 pairs in 2002 and population decline to 17 pairs in 2007. reproduction was highly variable: annual nesting success (pairs that raised >= 1 young) averaged 79% and ranged from 36% to 100%, whereas fecundity averaged 3.36 juveniles/pair and ranged from 1.43 juveniles/pair to 4.54 juveniles/pair. we estimated annual adult survival at 0.710 during the period of colony increase from 1996 to 2001 and 0.465 during decline from 2002 to 2007, but there was no change in annual survival of juveniles between the 2 time periods. long-term population growth rate (lambda) estimated from average vital rates was lambda(a) 1.072 with lambda(i) 1.288 during colony increase and lambda(d) = 0.921 (delta lambda = 0.368) during decline. a life table response experiment showed that change in adult survival rate during increasing and declining phases explained more than twice the variation in growth rate than other vital rates. our findings suggest that management and conservation of declining burrowing owl populations should address factors that influence adult survival.

correlates of survival in swainson's hawks breeding in northern california,buteo swainsoni; reproduction; survival; swainson's hawk; trade-off,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BRIGGS CW;WOODBRIDGE B;COLLOPY MW,"we used a 30-year study of breeding swainson's hawks (buteo swainsoni) in northern california to examine correlates of adult apparent survival using multistate models in program mark. specifically, we examined age-related patterns in adult apparent survival and how adult survival was correlated with average annual nest productivity, annual reproductive output, western juniper (juniperus occidentalis) density around nest sites, distance to agriculture, and amount of agriculture within a territory. annual estimates of adult survival varied from 0.85 to 0.9 (se = 0.02). there were no indications of senescence or other patterns of age-related changes in adult apparent survival. adult survival was inversely correlated with average reproductive output, with individuals producing >2 offspring having decreased survival, reflecting a possible trade-off between reproduction and survival. conversely, reproduction in any year was positively correlated with survival, providing evidence of individual quality influencing adult survival. the distance an individual had to travel to agriculture, where most individuals forage, was negatively related to survival. primary productivity within the average swainson's hawk territory was positively correlated with adult survival. our results indicate that individuals may have higher survival and fitness in areas with high proportions of irrigated agriculture that provides high prey densities, particularly alfalfa.

compensatory effects of recruitment and survival when amphibian populations are perturbed by disease,amphibian decline; batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; boreal toad; disease; host-pathogen dynamics; reverse-time pradel model; united states,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,MUTHS E;SCHERER RD;PILLIOD DS,"1. the need to increase our understanding of factors that regulate animal population dynamics has been catalysed by recent, observed declines in wildlife populations worldwide. reliable estimates of demographic parameters are critical for addressing basic and applied ecological questions and understanding the response of parameters to perturbations (e. g. disease, habitat loss, climate change). however, to fully assess the impact of perturbation on population dynamics, all parameters contributing to the response of the target population must be estimated. 2. we applied the reverse-time model of pradel in program mark to 6 years of capture-recapture data from two populations of anaxyrus boreas (boreal toad) populations, one with disease and one without. we then assessed a priori hypotheses about differences in survival and recruitment relative to local environmental conditions and the presence of disease. 3. we further explored the relative contribution of survival probability and recruitment rate to population growth and investigated how shifts in these parameters can alter population dynamics when a population is perturbed. 4. high recruitment rates (0.41) are probably compensating for low survival probability (range 0.51-0.54) in the population challenged by an emerging pathogen, resulting in a relatively slow rate of decline. in contrast, the population with no evidence of disease had high survival probability (range 0.75-0.78) but lower recruitment rates (0.25). 5. synthesis and applications. we suggest that the relationship between survival and recruitment may be compensatory, providing evidence that populations challenged with disease are not necessarily doomed to extinction. a better understanding of these interactions may help to explain, and be used to predict, population regulation and persistence for wildlife threatened with disease. further, reliable estimates of population parameters such as recruitment and survival can guide the formulation and implementation of conservation actions such as repatriations or habitat management aimed to improve recruitment."
coexistence in streams: do source-sink dynamics allow salamanders to persist with fish predators?,dicamptodon aterrimus; genetics; capture-mark-recapture; salamander; stable isotope,OECOLOGIA,SEPULVEDA AJ;LOWE WH,"theory suggests that source-sink dynamics can allow coexistence of intraguild predators and prey, but empirical evidence for this coexistence mechanism is limited. we used capture-mark-recapture, genetic methods, and stable isotopes to test whether source-sink dynamics promote coexistence between stream fishes, the intraguild predator, and stream salamanders (dicamptodon aterrimus), the intraguild prey. salamander populations from upstream reaches without fish were predicted to maintain or supplement sink populations in downstream reaches with fish. we found instead that downstream reaches with fish were not sinks even though fish consumed salamander larvae-apparent survival, recruitment, and population growth rate did not differ between upstream and downstream reaches. there was also no difference between upstream and downstream reaches in net emigration. we did find that d. aterrimus moved frequently along streams, but believe that this is a response to seasonal habitat changes rather than intraguild predation. our study provides empirical evidence that local-scale mechanisms are more important than dispersal dynamics to coexistence of streams salamanders and fish. more broadly, it shows the value of empirical data on dispersal and gene flow for distinguishing between local and spatial mechanisms of coexistence."
exploring sensitivity of a multistate occupancy model to inform management decisions,california spotted owl; lithobates sylvatica; multistate model; patch occupancy dynamics; second-order markov; strix occidentalis occidentalis; wood frog,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,GREEN AW;BAILEY LL;NICHOLS JD,"1. dynamic occupancy models are often used to investigate questions regarding the processes that influence patch occupancy and are prominent in the fields of population and community ecology and conservation biology. recently, multistate occupancy models have been developed to investigate dynamic systems involving more than one occupied state, including reproductive states, relative abundance states and joint habitat-occupancy states. here we investigate the sensitivities of the equilibrium-state distribution of multistate occupancy models to changes in transition rates. 2. we develop equilibrium occupancy expressions and their associated sensitivity metrics for dynamic multistate occupancy models. to illustrate our approach, we use two examples that represent common multistate occupancy systems. the first example involves a three-state dynamic model involving occupied states with and without successful reproduction (california spotted owl strix occidentalis occidentalis), and the second involves a novel way of using a multistate occupancy approach to accommodate second-order markov processes (wood frog lithobates sylvatica breeding and metamorphosis). 3. in many ways, multistate sensitivity metrics behave in similar ways as standard occupancy sensitivities. when equilibrium occupancy rates are low, sensitivity to parameters related to colonisation is high, while sensitivity to persistence parameters is greater when equilibrium occupancy rates are high. sensitivities can also provide guidance for managers when estimates of transition probabilities are not available. 4. synthesis and applications. multistate models provide practitioners a flexible framework to define multiple, distinct occupied states and the ability to choose which state, or combination of states, is most relevant to questions and decisions about their own systems. in addition to standard multistate occupancy models, we provide an example of how a second-order markov process can be modified to fit a multistate framework. assuming the system is near equilibrium, our sensitivity analyses illustrate how to investigate the sensitivity of the system-specific equilibrium state(s) to changes in transition rates. because management will typically act on these transition rates, sensitivity analyses can provide valuable information about the potential influence of different actions and when it may be prudent to shift the focus of management among the various transition rates."
habitat quality and habitat selection of golden-winged warblers in costa rica: an application of hierarchical models for open populations,apparent survival; dail-madsen model; golden-winged warbler; habitat quality; non-breeding season; population dynamics; recruitment; vermivora chrysoptera; winter ecology,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,CHANDLER RB;KING DI,"1. identifying high-quality habitat is integral to effective species conservation efforts and requires information about habitat-specific abundance and demographics. this information is lacking for many species of conservation concern because of the inherent difficulties associated with implementing mark-recapture studies at large spatial scales. 2. the golden-winged warbler vermivora chrysoptera is a neotropical-nearctic migratory bird experiencing a long-term population decline; yet no information about non-breeding season habitat quality or habitat selection exists to inform conservation efforts. we used a novel hierarchical model that requires only spatially and temporally replicated count data to estimate habitat-specific abundance, apparent survival, recruitment and detection probability of golden-winged warblers wintering in costa rica. we quantified habitat selection at the home-range level using radiotelemetry. 3. golden-winged warblers were absent from tropical dry forest and were most abundant in pre-montane evergreen forest. within their home ranges, golden-winged warblers selected microhabitat features associated with intermediate disturbance that reflected their preference for foraging in hanging dead leaves. 4. consistent with other evidence of a declining population, local population size decreased over the duration of the study. the rate of decrease was higher during the non-breeding season than among seasons. we found no differences in apparent survival or recruitment among habitat types; however, our estimates of these parameters were imprecise. 5. synthesis and applications. golden-winged warblers are forest-dependent species during the non-breeding season and have specialized microhabitat requirements that make them vulnerable to ongoing tropical deforestation. however, advanced secondary forests can provide the requisite microhabitat features, and because we found no evidence of reduced survival in this habitat type, regenerating forest on degraded lands may be an effective component of a conservation strategy for this species. our study also demonstrates that information on population dynamics and habitat quality can be obtained using repeated counts instead of mark-recapture methods."

genetic mark-recapture population estimation in black bears and issues of scale,abundance estimation; black bear; capture-mark-recapture; dna; local scale; new hampshire; ursus americanus,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,COSTER SS;KOVACH AI;PEKINS PJ;COOPER AB;TIMMINS A,"abundance estimates for black bears (ursus americanus) are important for effective management. recently, dna technology has resulted in widespread use of noninvasive, genetic capture-mark-recapture (cmr) approaches to estimate populations. few studies have compared the genetic cmr methods to other estimation methods. we used genetic cmr to estimate the bear population at 2 study sites in northern new hampshire (pittsburg and milan) in 2 consecutive years. we compared these estimates to those derived from traditional methods used by the new hampshire fish and game department (nhfg) using hunter harvest and mortality data. density estimates produced with genetic cmr methods were similar both years and were comparable to those derived from traditional methods. in 2006, the estimated number of bears in pittsburg was 79 (95% ci = 60-98) corresponding to a density of 15-24 (95% ci) bears/100 km(2); the 2007 estimate was 83 (95% ci = 67-99; density = 16-24 bears/100 km(2)). in 2006, the estimated number of bears in milan was 95 (95% ci = 74-117; density = 16-25 bears/100 km(2)); the 2007 estimate was 96 (95% ci = 77-114; density = 17-25 bears/100 km(2)). we found that genetic cmr methods were able to identify demographic variation at a local scale, including a strongly skewed sex ratio (2 m: 1 f) in the milan population. genetic cmr is a useful tool for wildlife managers to monitor populations of local concern, where abundance or demographic characteristics may deviate from regional estimates. future monitoring of the milan population with genetic cmr is recommended to determine if the sex ratio bias continues, possibly warranting a change in local harvest regimes.

"the impact of introduced predators, light-induced mortality of fledglings and poaching on the dynamics of the cory's shearwater (calonectris diomedea) population from the azores, northeastern subtropical atlantic",procellariiformes; population dynamics; light-induced mortality; azores; calonectris diomedea,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,FONTAINE R;GIMENEZ O;BRIED J,"cory's shearwater (calonectris diomedea) is a procellariiform seabird which breeds in the mediterranean and the north-eastern subtropical atlantic, and which is considered ""vulnerable"" in europe due to recent declines at some localities. in the azores archipelago (atlantic), the introduction of mammalian predators by man has led to petrels being extirpated from the main islands, except for cory's shearwater. currently, the azorean population of cory's shearwaters represents 65% of the species' world population. however, its dynamics remains unknown, although: (1) numbers might have declined by 43% between 1996 and 2001, (2) on the main islands, the young suffer mortality from introduced mammals, poachers, and urban lights upon fledging, and (3) at sea, the level of fishery mortality remains unknown. to fill this gap, we conducted a 7-year demographic survey on a mammal-free islet in the azores to determine adult survival rate using capture-mark-recapture of the breeders and to estimate fecundity. we also assessed urban mortality using the data from the rescue campaigns annually conducted in the archipelago. urban mortality concerned about 6% of fledglings, but its importance greatly varied among islands. when rescue campaigns occur, the rate might drop below 0.5%. overall, our simulations concerning the next 100 years do not allow excluding a decrease in cory's shearwater numbers in the azores without rescue campaigns (by 87% under the least favourable scenario). rescue campaigns should only slow down the decline unless, simultaneously, lower competition for nests compared to vila islet allows adults to breed almost every year on the main islands and juvenile survival exceeds a threshold value. since adult survival rate was high (>0.93), an eventual decline of the azorean population of cory's shearwaters would probably not result from fishery mortality of adults, but rather from poor fledgling productivity and perhaps also from low survival during the first year at sea.

estimation of short-term tag-induced mortality in horseshoe crabs limulus polyphemus,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,MATTEI JH;BEEKEY MA;POTTER HR;BOND CS;WORONIK AR;ROBERTS JA;SMITH KA,"horseshoe crabs limulus polyphemus range along the east coast of the united states and over 150,000 of them have been marked with u. s. fish and wildlife service disk tags. it has been assumed that the tags do not harm the animals and are similar to common epibionts often found on the shells of horseshoe crabs. we investigated whether newly tagged adult female horseshoe crabs would exhibit higher short-term mortality rates than untagged adult females. all crabs were collected from a beach in connecticut and then were transported to a laboratory for the experiment. tagging involved drilling a small hole through the carapace in the lower back corner of the prosoma and then inserting the tag into the hole. overall mortality of tagged and untagged females held in flow-through raceways for 44 d was minimal (0% mortality among 53 tagged crabs; 4% mortality among 52 untagged crabs). none of the horseshoe crabs lost or shed their disk tags over the course of the experiment. in field mark-recapture studies of horseshoe crabs, typically between 11% and 20% of the initial numbers of tagged crabs are recaptured. crabs that are recaptured but reported dead are unlikely to have died from the initial tagging process. our results indicate that newly tagged adult horseshoe crabs have the potential to survive as well as untagged crabs through the connecticut spawning season (similar to 30-45 d). recapture data also suggest that these crabs can survive for as long as 8-10 years with the tags in place."

effects of environmental variability and breeding experience on northern elephant seal demography,climate; el nino; el nino-southern oscillation (enso); mammal; mirounga angustirostris; phocidae; reproductive success; survival,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,LEE DE,"demographic rates of animals (i.e., survival and breeding success) generally increase with experience early in life, but temporal variation in the effect of experience on demography is not well understood. the demographic difference between inexperienced versus experienced breeders can be accentuated during poor environmental conditions when food is scarce, or the difference can remain constant regardless of environmental fluctuation. i tested the hypothesis that environmental variation accentuates the difference between inexperienced and experienced breeders using 20 years of capture mark recapture data for northern elephant seals (mirounga angustirostris) from the farallon islands, california. i estimated year-specific survival probabilities, breeding propensity (the probability that an individual will breed in year x), and breeding success of primiparous (inexperienced) and multiparous (experienced) females. primiparous breeders did not suffer more than experienced breeders during years of environmental stress. the selection hypothesis (a decrease in heterogeneity in individual quality within cohorts over time, based on selection pressure) could explain the experience-related improvement in survival and breeding success. lower variances in survival of multiparous breeders suggest that primiparous adults constitute a more heterogeneous portion of the population, and the 1st breeding event might act as a selective process leading to a more homogeneous pool of multiparous breeders."

life history benefits of residency in a partially migrating pond-breeding amphibian,breeding probability; capture-recapture; life history trade-offs; migration phenology; multistate mark-recapture; notophthalmus viridescens; partial migration; red-spotted newts; skipping reproduction; survival,ECOLOGY,GRAYSON KL;BAILEY LL;WILBUR HM,"species with partial migration, where a portion of a population migrates and the other remains residential, provide the opportunity to evaluate conditions for migration and test mechanisms influencing migratory decisions. we conducted a five-year study of two populations of red-spotted newts (notophthalmus viridescens), composed of individuals that either remain as residents in the breeding pond over the winter or migrate to the terrestrial habitat. we used multistate mark-recapture methods to (1) test for differences in survival probability between migrants and residents, (2) determine if migrants breed every year or skip opportunities for reproduction, and (3) estimate the frequency of individuals switching migratory tactic. we used estimates of life history parameters from the natural populations in combination with previous experimental work to evaluate processes maintaining partial migration at the population level and to assess mechanisms influencing the decision to migrate. based on capture-recapture information on over 3000 individuals, we found that newts can switch migratory tactics over their lifetime. we conclude that migrants and residents coexist through conditional asymmetries, with residents having higher fitness and inferior individuals adopting the migrant tactic. we found that newts are more likely to switch from residency to migrating than the reverse and males were more likely to remain as residents. migration differences between the sexes are likely driven by reproduction benefits of residency for males and high energetic costs of breeding resulting in lower breeding frequencies for females. environmental conditions also influence partial migration within a population; we found support for density-dependent processes in the pond strongly influencing the probability of migrating. our work illustrates how migration can be influenced by a complex range of individual and environmental factors and enhances our understanding of the conditions necessary for the evolution and maintenance of partial migration within populations."
using molecular and observational techniques to estimate the number and raiding patterns of crop-raiding elephants,habitual behaviour; males; molecular censusing; wildlife-human conflict,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,CHIYO PI;MOSS CJ;ARCHIE EA;HOLLISTER SMITH JA;ALBERTS SC,"p>1. conflict between humans and animals, generated by behaviours like crop raiding, can represent a major threat to the survival and conservation of protected species. crop raiding is an example where the conflict is assumed to be attributable to a small number of habitually raiding animals. no studies have systematically tested this assumption on african elephants loxodonta africana. 2. in the greater amboseli basin, in southern kenya, we determined the number of elephants that come into conflict with humans through crop raiding, their gender, and their patterns of raiding. we tracked footprints, and observed elephants after they raided farms, and genotyped dna extracted from faeces collected from raided farms. using these data, we estimated the number of raiders with asymptotic regression and count models. 3. we found that 241 elephants from several elephant populations in the amboseli basin raided farms. raiders were independent males; we detected no females raiding crops. approximately 35% of the raiders were from the amboseli elephant population, representing about 1/3 of the independent males in that population. approximately 12% of raiders from the amboseli elephant population were habitual and were responsible for 56% of elephant raiding events. 4. synthesis and applications. our results suggest that targeted elimination of habitual raiders could in theory reduce crop raiding. however, the large pool of occasional raiders, the availability of palatable crops in areas of conflict, and the link between crop-raiding and natural male foraging tactics, indicates great potential for recruitment of habitual raiders from this pool of occasional raiders. furthermore, shooting of raiders as a strategy for reducing crop raiding carries a high risk of misidentifying habitual raiders. we suggest instead an ethical management strategy that uses remote monitoring of raiders as an early warning system for crop protection, and longitudinal studies to evaluate the development of habitual raiding."
diagnosing the timing of demographic bottlenecks: sub-adult survival in red-billed choughs,apparent survival probability; capture-mark-recapture; conservation ecology; declining population; demographic variation; mortality,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,REID JM;BIGNAL EM;BIGNAL S;BOGDANOVA MI;MONAGHAN P;MCCRACKEN DI,"p>1. determining the precise timing and location of major demographic bottlenecks, such as periods of low survival, is key to identifying ecological causes of variation in population growth rate. such understanding is key to designing efficient and effective mitigation. 2. in a protected population of red-billed chough pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax on islay, scotland, variation in population growth rate largely reflects among-year variation in first-year survival. first-year survival was unprecedentedly low during 2007-2010, threatening population viability. 3. we used colour-ring resightings to estimate monthly survival probabilities (theta(m)) throughout the first year from fledging for eight chough cohorts (totalling 519 individuals) representing the full observed range of variation in first-year survival. we thereby identify the time and location of recent low survival. 4. on average across all cohorts, theta(m) varied among months, being low during the first month after ringing (may-june, accounting for c. 24% of all first-year mortality) and high during the last 4 months of the first year (january-may, accounting for c. 6% of all first-year mortality). most mortality (c. 70%) occurred after fledglings dispersed from natal territories. 5. the 2007-2009 cohorts experienced low theta(m) during july-december. this represents an additional low survival period compared to previous cohorts rather than decreased theta(m) across all months or further decreases through periods when theta(m) was low across all cohorts. 6. synthesis and applications. these data have general relevance in showing that dramatically low annual survival, which needs to spark rapid management action, can reflect different and unanticipated periods of low survival rather than exaggeration of typical variation. with specific regard to conserving islay's chough population, our data show that sub-adult survival has recently been low during july-december, probably reflecting conditions on key grassland foraging areas. managers aiming to increase population viability should increase invertebrate diversity, abundance and availability at these times and locations, thereby increasing foraging options available to choughs."
responses of leopard panthera pardus to the recovery of a tiger panthera tigris population,diet shift; food habits; intra-guild competition; spatial capture-recapture; sympatric large carnivores; terai-arc landscape; ungulate population,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,HARIHAR A;PANDAV B;GOYAL SP,"p>1. several conservation initiatives are aiming to improve the status of the rapidly dwindling populations of tiger panthera tigris. however, possible cascading effects of intra-guild competition on other sympatric carnivores are rarely considered while planning such recovery programmes. 2. in this study, we examine how, following the reduction of anthropogenic pressures by relocation of pastoralists, a recovering tiger population affects leopards panthera pardus in the chilla range of rajaji national park (rnp), india. by combining data gathered over 4 years (2004-2005 to 2007-2008) on prey availability, food habits and population density of the two predators, we investigate some of the mechanisms of niche partitioning. 3. based on existing information, we predicted that there would be high dietary overlap between the two predators. over time, optimal habitats would be dominated by tigers forcing leopards to the periphery of the protected area where they would subsist on small prey and domestic livestock. consequently, leopards would occur at a lower density where sympatric with tigers. 4. our results confirmed that annual dietary overlap (0 center dot 89, 0 center dot 82, 0 center dot 78, 0 center dot 77) between the two predators was high during the study. as expected, we observed a shift in the diet of leopards towards a significantly higher intake of domestic prey (similar to 6 center dot 8% to similar to 31 center dot 8%) and small prey (similar to 9% to similar to 36%). mean leopard density declined from 9 center dot 76 animals per 100 km2 in 2004-2005 to 2 center dot 07 per 100 km2 in 2007-2008, while the mean density of tigers increased from 3 center dot 31 per 100 km2 to 5 center dot 81 per 100 km2 over the same period. 5. synthesis and applications. although based on small sample sizes, our study revealed that over the 4 years following the relocation of pastoralists out of rnp, the tiger population recovered but leopard densities declined sharply. the concurrent shift in leopard diet indicated heightened livestock depredation from the surrounding area. therefore, it is important that conservation initiatives targeting the recovery of tigers should be preceded by careful examination of interspecific interactions with sympatric carnivores. comprehensive human-carnivore conflict management measures like monitoring the extent of livestock depredation, improving livestock management and providing adequate compensation and/or insurance schemes are critical for successfully implementing such conservation efforts."

estimating population characteristics of two saproxylic beetles: a mark-recapture approach,cerambycidae; coleoptera; population size; saproxylic; threatened species,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,TIKKAMAKI T;KOMONEN A,"using a mark-release-recapture technique we describe adult sex ratios, recapture rates and other sample characteristics of two saproxylic species: the nationally threatened longhorn beetle leptura (rutpela) maculata (coleoptera: cerambycidae) and the common l. quadrifasciata in southeastern finland over two summers. over 350 individuals of l. maculata and 150 individuals of l. quadrifasciata were captured on floral resource or in flight, and marked each summer. for l. maculata, the sex ratio was male-biased (2:1), whereas for l. quadrifasciata the bias was less clear. for both species, the male-bias may reflect behavioral differences between sexes, rather than true population differences. the proportion of recaptured individuals was low and varied between 7 and 33% depending on the species and year, which allowed us to estimate population parameters only for l. maculata in 2006. a model which assumed constant survival, but time-dependent catchability and entrance probability from a larger superpopulation, fit the data best. the precision of the total population size estimates were reasonable for all the models tested (coefficient of variation = 7-14%). based on the estimated local adult population size (mean +/- a 95% confidence interval = 865 +/- a 131), and the current distribution area of l. maculata, we infer that the species is not in immediate risk of extinction in finland. our analysis shows that mark-recapture technique can provide precise estimates of adult population size of saproxylic beetles which have different adult and larval habitats, and thus be useful in assessing extinction risk and monitoring population trends."
"are footprint tracking tunnels suitable for monitoring giant weta (orthoptera: anostostomatidae)? abundance, distribution and movement in relation to tracking rates",conservation; monitoring tool; tracking tunnels; threatened taxa,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,WATTS C;STRINGER I;THORNBURROW D;MACKENZIE D,"appropriate monitoring tools are essential for assessing the effectiveness of management for all threatened insect taxa. in new zealand the large-bodied flightless orthopterans in the genus deinacrida have mostly been monitored by searching through habitat during the day or spotlighting at night but this is time consuming and the results depend on the skill of the searcher. recently, footprint tracking tunnels, similar to those used for monitoring small mammals in new zealand, were found to be effective for detecting adults of various giant weta species. in this study, we compared the abundance of cook strait giant weta (csgw) in the vicinity of the tunnels, estimated by mark-recapture, with the number of tracking tunnels tracked by weta. we found strong indications that both baited and unbaited tracking tunnels can be used to estimate the number of adult weta present but that this probably depends on their responses to meteorological conditions which are not yet understood. our results also show that footprint tracking tunnels are more effective for detecting adult csgw than searching for these insects at night and that baiting tracking tunnels with peanut butter increases their effectiveness for detecting adult csgw. we confirmed how far cook strait giant weta moved each night on matiu-somes island by attaching transmitters to them and found that day roosts of three adult males were on average 8.6 m apart each day and those of adult females were on average 21.3 m apart. both the low recapture rates of marked adult csgw and the nightly displacements of those with transmitters suggest that adult csgw show no site fidelity and are clearly capable of moving large distances each night. however, an individual weta is unlikely to track more than one tunnel per night if tunnels are 30 m apart. tracking tunnels have the potential to be used with some other insects, provided their footprints are diagnostic. an advantage of using tracking tunnels is that they are non-lethal and would therefore be particularly suitable for monitoring other large threatened insect taxa."
disease and the extended phenotype: parasites control host performance and survival through induced changes in body plan,NA,PLOS ONE,GOODMAN BA;JOHNSON PTJ,"background: by definition, parasites harm their hosts. however, some forms of parasite-induced alterations increase parasite transmission between hosts, such that manipulated hosts can be considered extensions of the parasite's phenotype. while well accepted in principle, surprisingly few studies have quantified how parasite manipulations alter host performance and survival under field and laboratory conditions. methodology/principal findings: by interfering with limb development, the trematode ribeiroia ondatrae causes particularly severe morphological alterations within amphibian hosts that provide an ideal system to evaluate parasite-induced changes in phenotype. here, we coupled laboratory performance trials with a capture-mark-recapture study of 1388 pacific chorus frogs (pseudacris regilla) to quantify the effects of parasite-induced malformations on host locomotion, foraging, and survival. malformations, which affected similar to 50% of metamorphosing frogs in nature, caused dramatic reductions in all measures of organismal function. malformed frogs exhibited significantly shorter jumping distances (41% reduction), slower swimming speeds (37% reduction), reduced endurance (66% reduction), and lower foraging success relative to infected hosts without malformations. furthermore, while normal and malformed individuals had comparable survival within predator-free exclosures, deformed frogs in natural populations had 22% lower biweekly survival than normal frogs and rarely recruited to the adult population over a two-year period. conclusions/significance: our results highlight the ability of parasites to deeply alter multiple dimensions of host phenotype with important consequences for performance and survival. these patterns were best explained by malformation status, rather than infection per se, helping to decouple the direct and indirect effects of parasitism on host fitness."
planning for success: identifying effective and efficient survey designs for monitoring,cost analysis; monte carlo simulation; population trend; sample size; statistical power; study planning,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,REYNOLDS JH;THOMPSON WL;RUSSELL B,"selecting a survey design to detect change through time in an ecological resource requires balancing the speed with which a given level of change can be detected against the cost of monitoring. planning studies allow one to assess these tradeoffs and identify the optimal design choices for a specific scenario of change. however, such studies seldom are conducted. even worse, they seem least likely to be undertaken when they offer the most insight - when survey methods and monitoring designs are complex and not well captured by simple statistical models. this may be due to limited technical capacity within management agencies. without such planning, managers risk a potentially severe waste of monitoring resources on ineffective and inefficient monitoring, and institutions will remain ignorant of the true costs of information and the potential efficiency gains afforded by a moderate increase in technical capacity. we discuss the importance of planning studies, outline their main components, and illustrate the process through an investigation of competing designs for monitoring for declining brown bear (ursus arctos) densities in southwestern alaska. the results provide guidance on how long monitoring must be sustained before any change is likely to be detected (under a scenario of rather strong true decline), the optimal designs for detecting a change, and a tradeoff where accepting a delay of 2 years in detecting the change could reduce the monitoring cost by almost 50%. this report emphasizes the importance of planning studies for guiding monitoring decisions. published by elsevier ltd."

a comparison of tagging methodology for north pacific giant octopus enteroctopus dofleini,enteroctopus dofleini; tagging; mark-recapture; peterson disc; visible implant elastomer,FISHERIES RESEARCH,BARRY PD;TAMONE SL;TALLMON DA,"new opportunities for the export of food grade octopus have furthered interest in developing an actively managed directed fishery for north pacific giant octopus enteroctopus dofleini in alaska state waters. trawl, long-line, and pot fisheries already harvest over 230 metric tons of octopus as bycatch annually. managed under the authority of commissioner's permits, applications for directed harvest in most management regions have historically been rejected due to the lack of information on stock status. our limited knowledge of octopus movement, age structure, and demography hamper the ability to successfully manage this potential fishery. chief among these obstacles is the lack of abundance estimates on which to base harvest guidelines. while catch-per-unit-effort estimates can be made from bycatch data and used as a proxy of abundance, these estimates can often be inaccurate. mark-recapture estimates can be more accurate, but can also be expensive and require an effective means of marking individuals. we compared two different tags in order to assess their effectiveness for use on octopuses. we tagged 97 octopuses with modified peterson discs and visible implant elastomer tags in kachemak bay, alaska. three tagged octopuses were recaptured, making a statistically sound tag comparison difficult. our data suggest that visible implant elastomer tags will be a more effective means of marking octopuses.

effects of roads and crabbing pressures on diamondback terrapin populations in coastal georgia,crab trap; diamondback terrapin; malaclemys terrapin; mortality; roads; turtle,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,GROSSE AM;MAERZ JC;HEPINSTALL CYMERMAN J;DORCAS ME,"human activities, including the harvesting of natural resources and land development, place substantial pressure on wildlife. the diamondback terrapin (malaclemys terrapin) is a small, estuarine species of emydid turtle in decline and at risk due to a suite of human activities. vehicle-induced mortality from increasing coastal traffic and bycatch mortality in crab pots have been recognized as 2 of the primary conservation concerns for terrapins. we used mark-recapture estimates of terrapin density and sex ratio from repeated seining samples of 29 randomly stratified selected tidal creeks to evaluate the current relationships between road and crabbing pressures and the abundance, sex ratio, and size distribution of terrapin populations along the georgia coast. we obtained 2005 captures of 1,547 individual terrapins among 29 tidal creeks sampled. population density estimates ranged from 0 to 1,040 terrapins/km among tidal creeks with a median density of 65 terrapins/km. among all sites, terrapin density declined with increasing crabbing activity within the creek, but was not related to proximity to roads. sex ratios did not vary significantly with crabbing activity or proximity to roads; however, we found a significantly larger proportion of smaller-sized terrapins in creeks with no crabbing activity. although roads may have significant localized effects on terrapin populations, we found no measurable association between proximity to roads and current variation in terrapin density along the georgia coast. however, we did find that terrapin density and the proportion of smaller sized individuals within the population were negatively associated with crabbing activities. bycatch from commercial and recreational activities threaten many species. we add to a growing body of research showing crabbing activities are affecting diamondback terrapin populations across much of the species' range. states committed to the conservation of terrapins and coastal species should focus on reducing bycatch risk; for example by regulating soak times and locations, requiring the use of bycatch reduction devices, and removing abandoned or lost crab pots from coastal habitats.

partial migration in a robust brown trout population of a patagonian river,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,O NEAL SL;STANFORD JA,"life history plasticity, particularly partial migration (i.e., coexistence of resident and anadromous forms), probably plays a major role in the ability of brown trout salmo trutta to dominate food webs after introduction into patagonian rivers. we documented brown trout establishment, distribution, and life history variation in relation to habitat features in the rio grande, tierra del fuego, argentina. results support the hypothesis that rio grande brown trout developed an anadromous life history form (""sea trout"") two decades after introduction in relation to localized food limitation as the population expanded throughout the basin. tributary streams with only resident fish were narrower and had significantly higher levels of specific conductance and soluble reactive phosphorus than streams that were inhabited by both resident and anadromous brown trout. invertebrate biomass was two to three times higher and juvenile brown trout density was significantly higher in resident-only sites than in streams with both life history forms. density-dependent growth was not evident and juvenile condition was higher in resident-only streams. these findings suggest that food availability influences the individual decision to migrate, although genetic and other factors are probably also involved. mark-recapture analysis showed that approximately 38,000-55,000 adult sea trout returned annually to the rio grande in 2006 and 2007, making it one of the most robust sea trout populations in the world. however, native fishes have apparently declined to near extirpation as the brown trout population has expanded."

flight metabolic rate has contrasting effects on dispersal in the two sexes of the glanville fritillary butterfly,insect; mate location; sex-biased dispersal; mobility; phosphoglucose isomerase,OECOLOGIA,NIITEPOLD K;MATTILA ALK;HARRISON PJ;HANSKI I,"evolution of dispersal is affected by context-specific costs and benefits. one example is sex-biased dispersal in mammals and birds. while many such patterns have been described, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. here, we study genetic and phenotypic traits that affect butterfly flight capacity and examine how these traits are related to dispersal in male and female glanville fritillary butterflies (melitaea cinxia). we performed two mark-recapture experiments to examine the associations of individuals' peak flight metabolic rate (mrpeak) and pgi genotype with their dispersal in the field. in a third experiment, we studied tethered flight in the laboratory. mrpeak was negatively correlated with dispersal distance in males but the trend was positive in females, and the interaction between mrpeak and sex was significant for long-distance dispersal. a similar but nonsignificant trend was found in relation to molecular variation at pgi, which encodes a glycolytic enzyme: the genotype associated with high mrpeak tended to be less dispersive in males but more dispersive in females. the same pattern was repeated in the tethered flight experiment: the relationship between mrpeak and flight duration was positive in females but negative in males. these results suggest that females with high flight capacity are superior in among-population dispersal, which facilitates the spatial spreading of their reproductive effort. in contrast, males with high flight capacity may express territorial behaviour, and thereby increase the number of matings, whereas inferior males may be forced to disperse. thus, flight capacity has opposite associations with dispersal rate in the two sexes."

monitoring tiger populations using intensive search in a capture-recapture framework,camera traps; mark-recapture; panthera tigris; population monitoring; source populations; spatially explicit capture-recapture,POPULATION ECOLOGY,SHARMA RK;JHALA YV,"tigers (panthera tigris) today face multiple threats to their survival in the form of habitat loss, poaching, depletion of wild prey through illegal hunting and loss of connectivity between populations. monitoring of tigers is crucial to evaluate their status and react adaptively to management problems. though camera traps are becoming increasingly popular with researchers enumerating cryptic and elusive animals, they have not been embedded in the regular management activities of tiger reserves. tiger monitoring, though an important part of the management, is usually implemented using the unreliable pugmark approach. camera trap-based studies are few, usually of short duration, and are generally conducted by individual scientists and organizations. in this study, we integrate photographic mark-recapture with the routine activity of searching and locating tigers for tourist viewing by the park management in meadows of kanha tiger reserve which form a part of the tourism zone. we validate the density estimates from ""tiger search approach"" against those obtained from camera trapping and radio-telemetry conducted in conjunction in the same area. tiger density ((d) over cap (se[(d) over cap]) per 100 km(2) for camera traps and tiger search, respectively, was estimated at 12.0 (1.95) and 12.0 (1.76) when effective trapping area was estimated using the half mean maximum distance moved (1/2 mmdm), 7.6 (1.94) and 7.5 (1.97) using the home range radius, 7.3 (1.49) and 7.5 (1.97) with the full mmdm, and 8.0 (3.0) and 6.88 (2.39) with the spatial likelihood method in program density 4.1. camera trapping, however, was five times more expensive than the tiger search method. our study suggests that ""tiger search approach"" can be used as a regular monitoring tool in the tourism zones of tiger reserves, where often most of the source populations are located."
non-invasive genetic monitoring of wild central chimpanzees,NA,PLOS ONE,ARANDJELOVIC M;HEAD J;RABANAL LI;SCHUBERT G;METTKE E;BOESCH C;ROBBINS MM;VIGILANT L,"background: an assessment of population size and structure is an important first step in devising conservation and management plans for endangered species. many threatened animals are elusive, rare and live in habitats that prohibit directly counting individuals. for example, a well-founded estimate of the number of great apes currently living in the wild is lacking. developing methods to obtain accurate population estimates for these species is a priority for their conservation management. genotyping non-invasively collected faecal samples is an effective way of evaluating a species' population size without disruption, and can also reveal details concerning population structure. methodology/principal findings: we opportunistically collected wild chimpanzee faecal samples for genetic capture-recapture analyses over a four-year period in a 132 km 2 area of loango national park, gabon. of the 444 samples, 46% yielded sufficient quantities of dna for genotyping analysis and the consequent identification of 121 individuals. using genetic capture-recapture, we estimate that 283 chimpanzees (range: 208-316) inhabited the research area between february 2005 and july 2008. since chimpanzee males are patrilocal and territorial, we genotyped samples from males using variable y-chromosome microsatellite markers and could infer that seven chimpanzee groups are present in the area. genetic information, in combination with field data, also suggested the occurrence of repeated cases of intergroup violence and a probable group extinction. conclusions/significance: the poor amplification success rate resulted in a limited number of recaptures and hence only moderate precision (38%, measured as the entire width of the 95% confidence interval), but this was still similar to the best results obtained using intensive nest count surveys of apes (40% to 63%). genetic capture-recapture methods applied to apes can provide a considerable amount of novel information on chimpanzee population size and structure with minimal disturbance to the animals and represent a powerful complement to traditional field-based methods."
a multistate capture-recapture modeling strategy to separate true survival from permanent emigration for a passive integrated transponder tagged population of stream fish,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,HORTON GE;LETCHER BH;KENDALL WL,"robust estimates of survival and movement are important for informing the recovery of fish populations as well as for the study of life history, behavior, and population ecology. we present a multistate capture-recapture model that allows separate and simultaneous estimation of true survival and fidelity to the study reach in the presence of imperfect recapture and detection probabilities. the key study design element that permitted this separation was the use of a multiple-antenna array to detect passive integrated transponder (pit) tagged individuals as they emigrated from the study area. the modeling approach incorporated live recapture data during discrete sampling occasions with observational data on antenna detections of tagged individuals as they exited the study area between sampling occasions. the multistate emigration model was applied to empirical data from a stream-dwelling, pit-tagged cohort of atlantic salmon salmo salar for which emigration was continuously monitored by using a pair of stationary pit tag antennas. the study design we outline presents a way to inform key management, recovery, and ecological questions. our analysis showed how estimates of the joint probability of surviving and remaining faithful to the study reach (apparent survival) that were based solely on live recapture data (e. g., from the cormack-jolly-seber model) masked the patterns that were revealed when true survival and emigration were separately estimated with the multistate emigration model. use of the multistate model also allowed us to consider size dependence in survival and emigration in a straightforward way; the estimated size-dependent functions support hypotheses regarding the mechanisms leading to survival or emigration responses of atlantic salmon and other stream-dwelling salmonids."

influence of lung parasites on the growth rates of free-ranging and captive adult cane toads,anuran; bufo marinus; invasive species; rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala; rhinella marina,OECOLOGIA,KELEHEAR C;BROWN GP;SHINE R,"many parasites affect the viability of their hosts, but detailed studies combining empirical data from both the field and the laboratory are limited. consequently, the nature and magnitude of such effects are poorly known for many important host-parasite systems, including macroparasites of amphibians. we examined the effects of lungworm (rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala) infections in cane toads (bufo marinus) within their invasive australian range. the host-specificity of this parasite suggests that it might serve as a biological control agent for toads in australia, if infection proves to reduce toad viability. mark-recapture studies in the field (near darwin, northern territory) revealed lowered growth rates in infected adult toads when compared to uninfected toads, and a laboratory experiment confirmed causality: experimental infection with r. pseudosphaerocephala reduce toad growth rates. in combination with previous work on the current host-parasite system, it is now evident that nematode lungworms reduce the viability of both newly metamorphosed and adult cane toads, and do so in the field as well as in the laboratory. rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala may be a valuable component of a biological control strategy for cane toads in australia."
improving density estimates for elusive carnivores: accounting for sex-specific detection and movements using spatial capture-recapture models for jaguars in central brazil,bayesian analysis; camera trapping; cerrado; panthera onca; sex-specific movements,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,SOLLMANN R;FURTADO MM;GARDNER B;HOFER H;JACOMO ATA;TORRES NM;SILVEIRA L,"owing to habitat conversion and conflict with humans, many carnivores are of conservation concern. because of their elusive nature, camera trapping is a standard tool for studying carnivores. in many vertebrates, sex-specific differences in movements - and therefore detection by cameras - are likely. we used camera trapping data and spatially explicit sex-specific capture-recapture models to estimate jaguar density in emas national park in the central brazilian cerrado grassland, an ecological hotspot of international importance. our spatially explicit model considered differences in movements and trap encounter rate between genders and the location of camera traps (on/off road). we compared results with estimates from a sex-specific non-spatial capture-recapture model. the spatial model estimated a density of 0.29 jaguars 100 km(-2) and showed that males moved larger distances and had higher trap encounter rates than females. encounter rates with off-road traps were one tenth of those for on-road traps. in the non-spatial model, males had a higher capture probability than females; density was estimated at 0.62 individuals 100 km(-2). the non-spatial model likely overestimated density because it did not adequately account for animal movements. the spatial model probably underestimated density because it assumed a uniform distribution of jaguars within and outside the reserve. overall, the spatial model is preferable because it explicitly considers animal movements and allows incorporating site-specific and individual covariates. with both methods, jaguar density was lower than reported from most other study sites. for rare species such as grassland jaguars, spatially explicit capture-recapture models present an important advance for informed conservation planning.

frailty in state-space models: application to actuarial senescence in the dipper,actuarial senescence; bayesian; cinclus cinclus; dipper; frailty; individual heterogeneity; state-space models; survival,ECOLOGY,MARZOLIN G;CHARMANTIER A;GIMENEZ O,"senescence, a decrease in life history traits with age, is a within-individual process. the lack of suitable methods to deal with individual heterogeneity has long impeded progress in exploring senescence in wild populations. analyses of survival senescence are additionally complicated by the often neglected issue of imperfect detectability. to deal with both these issues, we developed state-space models to analyze capture-mark-recapture data while accounting for individual heterogeneity by incorporating random effects. we illustrated our approach by applying it to 29 years of data on breeding females in a dipper (cinclus cinclus) population. we highlighted patterns of age-related variation in annual survival by statistical comparisons of piecewise linear, quadratic, gompertz, and weibull survival models. the gompertz model was ranked first in our set. it provided strong evidence for actuarial senescence with an onset of senescence estimated at about 2.3 years. the probability for this model to involve a frailty was 0.15, and the probability to involve an individual latent effect in detection was about 0.4. the estimated mean age at first reproduction was 1.2 years. the general case model described here in detail should encourage the reanalysis of actuarial senescence in cases where imperfect detection or individual heterogeneity is suspected."
estimating detection and density of the andean cat in the high andes,argentina; camera trapping; felids; spatial capture-recapture,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,REPPUCCI J;GARDNER B;LUCHERINI M,"the andean cat (leopardus jacobita) is one of the most endangered, yet least known, felids. although the andean cat is considered at risk of extinction, rigorous quantitative population studies are lacking. because physical observations of the andean cat are difficult to make in the wild, we used a camera-trapping array to photo-capture individuals. the survey was conducted in northwestern argentina at an elevation of approximately 4,200 m during october-december 2006 and april-june 2007. in each year we deployed 22 pairs of camera traps, which were strategically placed. to estimate detection probability and density we applied models for spatial capture-recapture using a bayesian framework. estimated densities were 0.07 and 0.12 individual/km(2) for 2006 and 2007, respectively. mean baseline detection probability was estimated at 0.07. by comparison, densities of the pampas cat (leopardus colocolo), another poorly known fetid that shares its habitat with the andean cat, were estimated at 0.74-0.79 individual/km(2) in the same study area for 2006 and 2007, and its detection probability was estimated at 0.02. despite having greater detectability, the andean cat is rarer in the study region than the pampas cat. properly accounting for the detection probability is important in making reliable estimates of density, a key parameter in conservation and management decisions for any species."
nautilus at risk - estimating population size and demography of nautilus pompilius,NA,PLOS ONE,DUNSTAN A;BRADSHAW CJA;MARSHALL J,"the low fecundity, late maturity, long gestation and long life span of nautilus suggest that this species is vulnerable to over-exploitation. demand from the ornamental shell trade has contributed to their rapid decline in localized populations. more data from wild populations are needed to design management plans which ensure nautilus persistence. we used a variety of techniques including capture-mark-recapture, baited remote underwater video systems, ultrasonic telemetry and remotely operated vehicles to estimate population size, growth rates, distribution and demographic characteristics of an unexploited nautilus pompilius population at osprey reef (coral sea, australia). we estimated a small and dispersed population of between 844 and 4467 individuals (14.6-77.4 km(-2)) dominated by males (83: 17 male: female) and comprised of few juveniles (<10%). these results provide the first nautilid population and density estimates which are essential elements for long-term management of populations via sustainable catch models. results from baited remote underwater video systems provide confidence for their more widespread use to assess efficiently the size and density of exploited and unexploited nautilus populations worldwide."
spread of plague among black-tailed prairie dogs is associated with colony spatial characteristics,cynomys ludovicianus; disease; epizootic; mark-recapture; multi-state; program mark; yersinia pestis,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,JOHNSON TL;CULLY JF;COLLINGE SK;RAY C;FREY CM;SANDERCOCK BK,"sylvatic plague (yersinia pestis) is an exotic pathogen that is highly virulent in black-tailed prairie dogs (cynomys ludovicianus) and causes widespread colony losses and individual mortality rates >95%. we investigated colony spatial characteristics that may influence inter-colony transmission of plague at 3 prairie dog colony complexes in the great plains. the 4 spatial characteristics we considered include: colony size, euclidean distance to nearest neighboring colony, colony proximity index, and distance to nearest drainage (dispersal) corridor. we used multi-state mark-recapture models to determine the relationship between these colony characteristics and probability of plague transmission among prairie dog colonies. annual mapping of colonies and mark-recapture analyses of disease dynamics in natural colonies led to 4 main results: 1) plague outbreaks exhibited high spatial and temporal variation, 2) the site of initiation of epizootic plague may have substantially influenced the subsequent inter-colony spread of plague, 3) the long-term effect of plague on individual colonies differed among sites because of how individuals and colonies were distributed, and 4) colony spatial characteristics were related to the probability of infection at all sites although the relative importance and direction of relationships varied among sites. our findings suggest that conventional prairie dog conservation management strategies, including promoting large, highly connected colonies, may need to be altered in the presence of plague.

lessons from a failed translocation program with a seabird species: determinants of success and conservation value,conservation; chick translocation; dispersal; ecological trap; metapopulation; release site; survival,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ORO D;MARTINEZ ABRAIN A;VILLUENDAS E;SARZO B;MINGUEZ E;CARDA J;GENOVART M,"conservation diagnosis of ex situ techniques (e.g. releasing chicks by hacking) cannot be evaluated without quantitative assessment of the fate of individuals, mainly their survival and recruitment. here we use a long-term monitoring at a large spatial scale of a hacking programme (i.e. chick translocations) for audouin's gulls in an uninhabited site so as to establish a new breeding patch and reinforce the meta-population. the success of the programme relied on the assumption that birds tend to recruit to the site where they fledge (i.e. they were philopatric). multi-state capture-recapture models applied to a large dataset (more than 43,500 resights at 30 colonies during 1999-2010) were used to evaluate the survival of released chicks and the probability of being philopatric. adult survival was high, but juvenile survival was lower than that of wild gulls, suggesting that there was a cost associated with hacking only during their first year of life. as expected, most released birds returned to the hacking site, but very few (including immigrants from abroad) attempted to breed here. dispersal was inversely correlated with distance from the hacking site and positively associated with the population size of the patch (i.e. conspecific attraction). even though most hacking procedures met the ecological conditions to succeed, results clearly showed that the program failed to establish a new breeding site. the ability of prospecting and the attraction made by conspecifics at established sites may be a constraint for the success of hacking programs, particularly for social and nomadic species.

can the abundance of tigers be assessed from their signs?,camera trap; double sampling; indices of abundance; mark-recapture; panthera tigris; power analysis; regression models,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,JHALA Y;QURESHI Q;GOPAL R,"p>1. indices of abundance offer cost effective and rapid methods for estimating abundance of endangered species across large landscapes, yet their wide usage is controversial due to their potential of being biased. here, we assess the utility of indices for the daunting task of estimating the abundance of the endangered tiger at landscape scales. 2. we use double sampling to estimate two indices of tiger abundance (encounters of pugmarks and scats per km searched) and calibrate those indices against contemporaneous estimates of tiger densities obtained using camera-trap mark-recapture (ctmr) at 21 sites (5185 km2) in central and north india. we use simple and multiple weighted regressions to evaluate relationships between tiger density and indices. a model for estimating tiger density from indices was validated by jackknife analysis and precision was assessed by correlating predicted tiger density with ctmr density. we conduct power analysis to estimate the ability of ctmr and of indices to detect changes in tiger density. 3. tiger densities ranged between 0 center dot 25 and 19 tigers 100 km-2 were estimated with an average coefficient of variation of 13 center dot 2(se 2 center dot 5)%. tiger pugmark encounter rates explained 84% of the observed variability in tiger densities. after removal of an outlier (corbett), square root transformed scat encounter rates explained 82% of the variation in tiger densities. 4. a model including pugmark and scat encounters explained 95% of the variation in tiger densities with good predictive ability (press r2 = 0 center dot 99). overall, ctmr could detect tiger density changes of > 12% with 80% power at alpha = 0 center dot 3, while the index based model had 50% to 85% power to detect > 30% declines. the power of indices to detect declines increased at high tiger densities. 5. synthesis and applications. indices of tiger abundance obtained from across varied habitats and a range of tiger densities could reliably estimate tiger abundance. financial and temporal costs of estimating indices were 7% and 34% respectively, of those for ctmr. the models and methods presented herein have application in evaluation of the abundance of cryptic carnivores at landscape scales and form part of the protocol used by the indian government for evaluating the status of tigers."
inflammation in digits of unmarked and toe-tipped wild hylids,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,PHILLOTT AD;MCDONALD KR;SKERRATT LF,"context. the use of toe-tipping (removal of the toe pad) in mark-recapture studies of anurans is controversial because of the unknown risk of infection and potential impact on animal survival. aims. we compared the inflammation rates of digits in unmarked and toe-tipped wild hylid frogs (litoria genimaculata, l. nannotis, l. rheocola and nyctimystes dayi) to determine if marked amphibians present with a greater proportion of affected digits than unmarked animals. methods. we examined marked and unmarked frogs captured on streams in northern queensland over a 12-month period for phalangeal inflammation. key results. of 777 unmarked frogs, 0.4% presented with digits showing inflammation because of natural causes. after toe-tipping, 59.1% of the frogs were recaptured within a mean of 97 days +/- standard deviation of 102 days, with macroscopic inflammation observed in 1.3% of marked animals. the proportion of marked frogs with inflamed, toe-tipped digits did not differ significantly from that of inflamed digits in unmarked frogs (fisher exact test p = 0.085) but the odds ratio (3.417, 0.851-13.730) indicated a greater likelihood of inflamed digits occurring in toe-tipped than unmarked frogs. conclusions. although the risk of inflammation increased 3-fold in marked hylids, the low proportion of frogs affected (1.3%) indicated the potential pathological risk of toe-tipping did not outweigh the benefits of using the marking method. implications. this study suggests that toe-tipping may be an appropriate and relatively safe marking method in stream-dwelling hylid populations."
the influence of neighbourhood socio-demographic factors on densities of free-roaming cat populations in an urban ecosystem in israel,abundance; anthropogenic factors; capture-recapture; mark; popan; socio-economic status,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,FINKLER H;HATNA E;TERKEL J,"context. free-roaming cat populations are abundant in many urban ecosystems worldwide. their management is necessary for reasons of public health, risk of wildlife predation and cat welfare related to their high densities. trap-neuter-return (tnr) programs are now the main cat population control strategy in urban areas. however, the efficacy of such strategies is difficult to evaluate without more precise estimates of cat numbers and a better knowledge of anthropogenic influences on cat densities. aims. we aimed to estimate free-roaming cat population numbers and density in residential neighbourhoods in tel aviv, and to investigate population densities in relation to several socio-demographic factors. methods. we compared free-roaming cat population densities in terms of neighbourhood socio-economic status (ses), housing type, human density and percentage of residential and commercial areas. five consecutive cat density surveys were carried out in eight residential neighbourhoods in israel - four in northern tel aviv, characterised by high ses, and four in southern tel aviv, characterised by low ses. the photographic capture-recapture technique was used and abundance estimates were evaluated using the mark program. regression analyses examined the effect of socio-demographic factors on cat densities. key results. neighbourhood socio-economic status significantly influenced kitten density and proportion of neutered cats in the total population: southern neighbourhoods had higher kitten densities and lower neutered cat proportions compared with northern neighbourhoods. higher adult cat densities featured in mixed profile neighbourhoods of residential and commercial areas compared with solely residential neighbourhoods. using the linear equation from the regression analysis the entire free-roaming cat population in tel aviv was extrapolated to 39 000 cats. conclusions. the results suggest that adult cat and kitten densities depend in part on socio-demographic factors, specifically on neighbourhood socio-economic status and the proportion of residential area. implications. our findings in tel aviv may be used to improve cat management efforts, by focusing on neighbourhoods hosting higher cat densities; as well as to improve cat welfare by focusing on neighbourhoods with lower neutering rates and higher kitten densities. finally, the current study may serve as a basis for studies in other cities with similar cat overpopulation problems."
resolving some of the complexity of a mixed-origin walleye population in the east basin of lake erie using a mark-recapture study,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,ZHAO YM;EINHOUSE DW;MACDOUGALL TM,"at least two genetically distinct populations of walleye sander vitreus reproduce in lake erie: one west-basin-origin population and one east-basin-origin population. each year, some west-basin-origin walleyes migrate to the east basin and create a mixed-origin walleye population. uncertainties associated with this migratory behavior make it difficult to describe the dynamics of the east-basin-origin population. we used mark-recapture analysis to estimate the dynamics of the east-basin-origin walleye population and to measure the contribution of west-basin-origin walleyes to the total walleye harvest in the east basin. compared with the west-basin-origin walleyes, the east-basin-origin walleyes experienced lower fishing pressure, lower natural mortality, and a higher survival rate. on average, the west-basin-origin walleye migrants comprised about 90% of the annual harvest in the east basin. the number of the west-basin-origin walleyes migrating to the east basin was linearly related to their abundance. walleyes showed a strong fidelity to their spawning sites. this study provided an approach to the assessment of population dynamics and the management of walleye fisheries in the east basin of lake erie."
accurate estimation of salmonid abundance in small streams using nighttime removal electrofishing: an evaluation using marked fish,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,SAUNDERS WC;FAUSCH KD;WHITE GC,"estimation of stream fish abundance using removal electrofishing is common and allows sampling of fish populations during a single site visit. however, recent evaluations have demonstrated that removal estimators can substantially underestimate fish abundance, raising concerns about using this method. we evaluated removal estimates of trout (family salmonidae) abundance using night electrofishing in 200-300-m reaches of 8 rocky mountain streams and analyzed the data using new methods in program mark to account for potential sources of bias. the removal estimates were validated using populations of previously captured and marked resident fish. overall, removal estimates were accurate estimates of the number of marked fish in study reaches (mean bias, -2.4% [1 fish/reach]), and removal and mark-recapture estimates of total fish abundance also differed by less than 1 fish/reach on average. in general, capture probabilities were high (average = 97% over three passes), and removal estimates had narrow 95% confidence intervals that included the known number of marked fish for all but 1 of 17 estimates for three trout species. capture probability increased with fish length and was greater on the first than on subsequent electrofishing passes. capture probability also varied among sites, but this variation was not accounted for by any measured habitat variable. finally, fish that had been previously marked were slightly more likely to be captured during electrofishing, even though the recovery periods for most fish exceeded 24 h. simulations confirmed our finding that accounting for the heterogeneity in capture probability owing to individual fish size reduced the bias in removal estimates. our results demonstrate that three-pass removal electrofishing can provide accurate estimates of fish abundance when field methods are designed to maximize capture probability and when modern analytical tools are used to account for the heterogeneity in capture probability."
"predation on juvenile pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp. in downstream migrant traps in prairie creek, california",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,DUFFY WG;BJORKSTEDT EP;ELLINGS CS,"downstream migrant traps are a widely applied fishery management tool for sampling anadromous pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead o. mykiss smolts along the west coast of north america and elsewhere, yet predation on juvenile salmonids in traps has not been studied quantitatively. we assessed the frequency of occurrence and abundance of juvenile salmonids in the stomachs of coastal cutthroat trout o. clarkii clarkii, coho salmon o. kisutch, steelhead, and prickly sculpin cottus asper (> 70 mm fork length) captured in traps and in nearby stream habitats. all four predator species took juvenile salmonids with much greater frequency in traps than in stream habitats. among free-swimming predators, only coastal cutthroat trout were observed with salmonid fry in their stomachs, but they took fewer salmonid prey and appeared to rely more heavily on insect prey than did coastal cutthroat trout captured in traps. predators consumed up to 25% of the available prey over a broad range of prey abundances. over the course of the study, predators consumed 2.5% of all salmonid fry captured in traps, but this fraction ranged from less than 1% to more than 10% in any given year. the number of prey taken in traps increased with predator length and with prey abundance in traps, and predation in traps peaked during the period of most intense downstream migration by salmon fry. in contrast, live-box design and trap location had little or no effect on the total number of prey taken by individual predators. we estimated that the predation mortality of juvenile salmon increased by 0.5-1.0% due to in-trap predation (i.e., a 9-10% relative increase over natural predation rates). we found no evidence that predators selected for prey on the basis of species. these results should motivate additional research on methods that reduce or eliminate predation in trap live-boxes and protocols for efficiently measuring predation associated with the trapping of downstream migrants."

contrasted demographic responses facing future climate change in southern ocean seabirds,climate change; demography; ipcc emission scenarios; multi-state capture-recapture; population dynamics; sea ice concentration; sea surface temperature; seabirds; southern indian ocean; stochastic matrix population models,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,BARBRAUD C;RIVALAN P;INCHAUSTI P;NEVOUX M;ROLLAND V;WEIMERSKIRCH H,"p>1. recent climate change has affected a wide range of species, but predicting population responses to projected climate change using population dynamics theory and models remains challenging, and very few attempts have been made. the southern ocean sea surface temperature and sea ice extent are projected to warm and shrink as concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases increase, and several top predator species are affected by fluctuations in these oceanographic variables. 2. we compared and projected the population responses of three seabird species living in sub-tropical, sub-antarctic and antarctic biomes to predicted climate change over the next 50 years. using stochastic population models we combined long-term demographic datasets and projections of sea surface temperature and sea ice extent for three different ipcc emission scenarios (from most to least severe: a1b, a2, b1) from general circulation models of earth's climate. 3. we found that climate mostly affected the probability to breed successfully, and in one case adult survival. interestingly, frequent nonlinear relationships in demographic responses to climate were detected. models forced by future predicted climatic change provided contrasted population responses depending on the species considered. the northernmost distributed species was predicted to be little affected by a future warming of the southern ocean, whereas steep declines were projected for the more southerly distributed species due to sea surface temperature warming and decrease in sea ice extent. for the most southerly distributed species, the a1b and b1 emission scenarios were respectively the most and less damaging. for the two other species, population responses were similar for all emission scenarios. 4. this is among the first attempts to study the demographic responses for several populations with contrasted environmental conditions, which illustrates that investigating the effects of climate change on core population dynamics is feasible for different populations using a common methodological framework. our approach was limited to single populations and have neglected population settlement in new favourable habitats or changes in inter-specific relations as a potential response to future climate change. predictions may be enhanced by merging demographic population models and climatic envelope models."
characterizing demographic variation and contributions to population growth rate in a declining population,capture-mark-recapture; life table response experiment; life-history variation; multiple breeding attempts; sensitivity; vital rate,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,SIM IMW;REBECCA GW;LUDWIG SC;GRANT MC;REID JM,"p>1. understanding how demographic variation translates into variation in population growth rate (lambda) is central to understanding population dynamics. such understanding ideally requires knowledge of the mean, variance and covariance among all demographic rates, allowing the potential and realized contribution of each rate to lambda to be estimated. such studies require integrated monitoring of all demographic rates across multiple years and are consequently rare, particularly in declining populations and for species with less tractable life histories. 2. we used 12 years of comprehensive demographic data from a declining ring ouzel (turdus torquatus) population to estimate the mean, variance and covariance in all major demographic rates and estimate potential and realized demographic contributions to lambda. 3. population size decreased from 39 to 13 breeding pairs (-67%) and mean lambda was 0 center dot 91 during 1998-2009. this decrease did not reflect a substantial concurrent decrease in any single key demographic rate, but reflected varying combinations of demographic rates that consistently produced lambda < 1. 4. basic prospective elasticity analysis indicated that lambda was most sensitive to adult survival, closely followed by early season reproductive success and early brood first-year survival. in contrast, integrated elasticity analysis, accounting for estimated demographic covariance, indicated that lambda was most sensitive to early brood first-year survival, closely followed by re-nesting rate, early season reproductive success, late-brood first-year survival and adult survival. 5. retrospective decomposition of variance suggested that first-year survival contributed most to observed variation in lambda. 6. however, demographic comparison with other related species suggested that adult survival, but not reproductive success or post-fledging survival, averaged lower than expected throughout the 12-year study. 7. these data demonstrate that multiple approaches, including comprehensive demographic and comparative analyses and due consideration of conflicting answers, may be necessary to accurately diagnose the demographic basis of population change."
ecological and methodological factors affecting detectability and population estimation in elusive species,aquatic snakes; behavioral responses; detection probability; mark-recapture; minnow trap; nerodia fasciata; population estimation; robust design; seminatrix pygaea; temporary emigration,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,WILLSON JD;WINNE CT;TODD BD,"although mark-recapture methods are among the most powerful tools for monitoring wildlife populations, the secretive nature of some species requires a comprehensive understanding of the factors that affect capture probability to maximize accuracy and precision of population parameter estimates (e.g., population size and survivorship). here, we used aquatic snakes as a case study in applying rigorous mark-recapture methods to estimate population parameters for secretive species. specifically, we used intensive field sampling and robust design mark-recapture analyses in program mark to test specific hypotheses about ecological and methodological factors influencing detectability of two species of secretive aquatic snakes, the banded watersnake (nerodia fasciata), and the black swamp snake (seminatrix pygaea). we constructed a candidate set of a priori mark-recapture models incorporating various combinations of time-and sex-varying capture and recapture probabilities, behavioral responses to traps (i.e., trap-happiness or trap-shyness), and temporary emigration, and we ranked models for each species using akaike's information criterion. for both banded watersnakes and black swamp snakes we found strong support for time-varying capture and recapture probabilities and strong trap-happy responses, factors that can bias population estimation if not accommodated in the models. we also found evidence of sex-dependent temporary emigration in black swamp snakes. our study is among the first comprehensive assessments of factors affecting detectability in snakes and provides a framework for studies aimed at monitoring populations of other secretive species.

"natural mortality in relation to age and fishing mortality on walleyes in escanaba lake, wisconsin, during 1956-2009",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HANSEN MJ;FAYRAM AH;NEWMAN SP,"to evaluate the dynamics of fishing and natural mortality, we used a catch-age cohort analysis model of the population dynamics of walleye sander vitreus in escanaba lake, wisconsin, during 1956-2009. the catch-age model was based on angling catches at age from a compulsory creel census, abundance at age from mark-recapture studies, and recruitment at age 0 from mark-recapture studies. harvest of age-3 and older (age-3+) walleyes averaged 12.5 fish/ha and varied 55% among years during 1956-2002, before the imposition of a 71-cm (28-in) minimum length limit that eliminated harvest. the population density of age-3+ walleyes averaged 34.8 fish/ha and varied 51% among years during 1956-2009. annual exploitation of age-3+ walleyes averaged 34% during 1956-2002 and varied 35% among years during that period. the variation in population density explained only 0.5% of the variation in annual exploitation during 1956-2002. natural mortality was best described by a model with decreasing age-specific vulnerability and a negative relationship with angling exploitation. relative vulnerability to natural mortality declined gradually with age from 100% at age 0 to 83% at age 3, 50% at age 9.4, and 24% at age 17. relative vulnerability to fishing mortality increased sharply from less than 1% at age 0 to 98% at age 3, peaked at 100% at age 4, and declined gradually to 66% at age 17. fully vulnerable natural mortality (m) declined from 0.70 to 0.10 (mean = 0.41) as annual angling exploitation (u) on age-3+ walleyes increased from 0.0 to 0.65 (mean = 0.30). our findings suggest that natural mortality declines with age and is inversely related to fishing mortality, so that it varies among ages and years. we conclude that stock assessment models for walleye fisheries should evaluate the effects of year-specific and age-specific natural mortality on model predictions."
long-term pit and t-bar anchor tag retention rates in adult muskellunge,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,RUDE NP;WHITLEDGE GW;PHELPS QE;HIRST S,"mark-recapture studies require knowledge of tag retention rates specific to the tag types, fish species and size, and study duration. we determined the probability of tag loss for passive integrated transponder (pit) tags implanted into dorsal musculature, t-bar anchor tags attached to dorsal pterygiophores, and both tags in relation to years posttagging for double-marked adult muskellunge esox masquinongy over a 10-year period. we also used pit tags as a benchmark to assess the interactive effects of fish length at tagging, sex, and years posttagging on t-bar anchor tag loss rates. only five instances of pit tag loss were identified; the calculated probability of a fish's losing its pit tag was consistently less than 1.0% for up to 10 years posttagging. the probability of t-bar anchor tag loss by muskellunge was related to both the number of years posttagging and the total length (tl) of the fish at tagging. the t-bar anchor tag loss rate 1 year after tagging was 6.5%. individuals of less than 750 mm tl at tagging had anchor tag loss rates less than 10% for up to 6 years after tagging. however, the proportion of fish losing t-bar anchor tags steadily increased with increasing years posttagging (similar to 30% after 6 years) for larger muskellunge. fish gender did not influence the probability of t-bar anchor tag loss. our results indicate that t-bar anchor tags are best suited for short-term applications (<= 1 year) involving adult muskellunge. we recommend use of pit tags for longer-term tagging studies, particularly for muskellunge larger than 750 mm tl."
the effectiveness of deepwater release at improving the survival of discarded yelloweye rockfish,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HOCHHALTER SJ;REED DJ,"the effectiveness of deepwater release at improving the 17-d survival of discarded yelloweye rockfish sebastes ruberrimus was determined by comparing an estimate of survival for individuals released at depth with an estimate of submergence probability for individuals released at the water's surface. a mark-recapture study was used to generate a maximum likelihood estimate of the 17-d survival probability of yelloweye rockfish (n = 182) caught by hook and line (depth = 18-72 m) and subsequently released at depth. the average cormack-jolly-seber survival probability for yelloweye rockfish released at depth was remarkably high (0.988; 95% confidence interval = 0.478-0.999) and positively correlated with individual total length. survival probability was not significantly influenced by the range of capture depths explored in this study or by exposure to barotrauma and other capture stressors. the submergence success of yelloweye rockfish released at the water's surface was 0.221 (95% confidence interval = 0.149-0.315), suggesting that the maximum survival potential of individuals released at the surface is low. the results of this study indicate that the average survival of discarded yelloweye rockfish can be substantially improved by deepwater release."
relationship between electrofishing catch rate and adult trout abundance in wisconsin streams,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,BERGMAN PS;HANSEN MJ;NATE NA,"the relative quickness and cost effectiveness of single-pass electrofishing samples (catch per effort [cpe]) argues for their use over multiple-pass estimates for enumerating stream fish populations. however, cpe can be an imprecise index of fish abundance and therefore may be less useful than more-precise indices of abundance, such as those obtained from mark-recapture or depletion methods, for assessing trout populations. we evaluated the use of single-pass electrofishing samples (catch/mi) as abundance (number/mi) predictors of adult brook trout salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout salmo trutta in wisconsin streams by quantifying the relationship between electrofishing cpe and adult trout abundance. first, we tested for linearity of the relationship between cpe and adult trout abundance while accounting for measurement error. next, we explained the residual variability in the relationship using physical and biological attributes of surveyed streams. we found that the relationship between cpe and adult trout abundance was proportional (linear) for both brook trout and brown trout. electrofishing catchability did not differ significantly between trout species or among seasons or ecoregions. however, catchability was significantly greater for towed-barge electrofishing (0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.73) than backpack electrofishing (0.23; 0.09-0.59). adult trout abundance alone explained 82% of the variation in cpe for backpack units and 87% of the variation in cpe for towed-barge units. stream habitat features such as stream slope, mean stream width, and pool density failed to explain additional variation in catchability. our results indicate that cpe can provide a reliable index of adult trout abundance in wisconsin streams, but mark-recapture methods may still be needed to obtain a more precise estimate of abundance. however, because time and effort can be reduced 50% if single-pass cpes are used instead of mark-recapture abundance estimates to predict adult trout abundance, managers may choose to sacrifice higher precision for reduced sampling effort."

heterogeneous capture rates in low density populations and consequences for capture-recapture analysis of camera-trap data,abundance estimates; capture probability; closed population model; jaguar; mark-recapture; reliability,POPULATION ECOLOGY,HARMSEN BJ;FOSTER RJ;DONCASTER CP,"closed population capture-recapture analysis of camera-trap data has become the conventional method for estimating the abundance of individually recognisable cryptic species living at low densities, such as large felids. often these estimates are the only information available to guide wildlife managers and conservation policy. capture probability of the target species using camera traps is commonly heterogeneous and low. published studies often report overall capture probabilities as low as 0.03 and fail to report on the level of heterogeneity in capture probability. we used simulations to study the effects of low and heterogeneous capture probability on the reliability of abundance estimates using the m-h jack-knife estimator within a closed-population capture-recapture framework. high heterogeneity in capture probability was associated with under- and over-estimates of true abundance. the use of biased abundance estimates could have serious conservation management consequences. we recommend that studies present capture frequencies of all sampled individuals so that policy makers can assess the reliability of the abundance estimates."

global population status of shy albatross and an assessment of colony-specific trends and drivers,demography; fisheries by-catch; population status; shy albatross; thalassarche cauta,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,ALDERMAN R;GALES R;TUCK GN;LEBRETON JD,"context. monitoring the status of albatross populations and identifying the factors driving observed trends remain international conservation and management priorities. the shy albatross is endemic to australia and breeds only on three tasmanian islands. aims. to provide a reliable total population estimate for shy albatross, including an assessment of demographic trends for each of the three populations where possible. we consider also key drivers of population trends for each population, particularly the potential role of fisheries by-catch, with an overall aim of determining the status of the species. methods. aerial photography and ground surveys were used to estimate the number of annual breeding pairs and trends in adult and juvenile survival rates were calculated using mark-recapture methods. at-sea distribution data was used to identify population specific trends in the overlap of shy albatross and fisheries to evaluate the potential influence of fisheries by-catch on the populations. key results. the albatross island population increased post-harvesting but has recently stabilised at around 5200 breeding pairs, less than half its estimated historic size. this trajectory change appears driven by a decrease in juvenile survival. the small (170 breeding pairs) pedra branca population has recently declined, probably due to reduced breeding success associated with the increasing population of australasian gannets (morus serrator) on the island. the largest population (on mewstone) comprises at least 9500 breeding pairs. trends for this population are unknown. however, this paper demonstrates that these birds have greater overlap with trawl and longline fishing effort and are consequently at higher risk of fishing-related mortality. conclusions. given the extent of fisheries overlap, survival rates for mewstone individuals are likely to be lower than the albatross island population. combined with recent trends on pedra branca and albatross island, we suggest that the current status of the shy albatross is likely to be stable at best and quite possibly decreasing. implications. the concerns raised about the conservation status of shy albatross reinforce the importance of continued population monitoring focussed particularly on establishing the trend of mewstone. a thorough assessment of interactions with trawl fishing operations also is a management priority for this species."
estimating and indexing feral cat population abundances using camera traps,abundance index; camera trap; felis catus; feral cat; mark-recapture,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,BENGSEN A;BUTLER J;MASTERS P,"context. the ability to monitor changes in population abundance is critical to the success of pest animal management and research programs. feral cats (felis catus) are an important pest animal, but current monitoring techniques have limited sensitivity or are limited in use to particular circumstances or habitats. recent advances in camera-trapping methods provide the potential to identify individual feral cats, and to use this information to estimate population abundances using capture-mark-recapture (cmr) methods. aims. here, we use a manipulative study to test whether camera-trapping and cmr methods can be used to estimate feral cat abundances. methods. we established a grid of infrared cameras and lure stations over three pastoral properties on kangaroo island, australia, for 15 days. we then reduced the population abundance with an intensive trapping program and repeated the camera survey. we estimated population abundances using robust design cmr models, and converted abundance estimates to densities using home-range data from gps tracking. we also calculated relative abundance indices from the same data. key results. the cmr methods produced credible estimates of the change in population abundance, with useful confidence intervals, showing a statistically identifiable population decline from at least 0.7 cats km(-2) before trapping down to 0.4 cats km(-2) after trapping. the indexing method also showed a statistically identifiable decrease in abundance. conclusions. camera-trapping and cmr methods can provide a useful method for monitoring changes in the absolute abundance of feral cat populations. camera-trap data may also be used to produce indices of relative abundance when the assumptions of cmr models cannot be met. implications. these methods are widely applicable. the ability to reliably estimate feral cat abundances allows for more effective management than is generally available."

a likelihood framework for joint estimation of salmon abundance and migratory timing using telemetric mark-recapture,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,BROMAGHIN JF;GATES KS;PALMER DE,"many fisheries for pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp. are actively managed to meet escapement goal objectives. in fisheries where the demand for surplus production is high, an extensive assessment program is needed to achieve the opposing objectives of allowing adequate escapement and fully exploiting the available surplus. knowledge of abundance is a critical element of such assessment programs. abundance estimation using mark-recapture experiments in combination with telemetry has become common in recent years, particularly within alaskan river systems. fish are typically captured and marked in the lower river while migrating in aggregations of individuals from multiple populations. recapture data are obtained using telemetry receivers that are co-located with abundance assessment projects near spawning areas, which provide large sample sizes and information on population-specific mark rates. when recapture data are obtained from multiple populations, unequal mark rates may reflect a violation of the assumption of homogeneous capture probabilities. a common analytical strategy is to test the hypothesis that mark rates are homogeneous and combine all recapture data if the test is not significant. however, mark rates are often low, and a test of homogeneity may lack sufficient power to detect meaningful differences among populations. in addition, differences among mark rates may provide information that could be exploited during parameter estimation. we present a temporally stratified mark-recapture model that permits capture probabilities and migratory timing through the capture area to vary among strata. abundance information obtained from a subset of populations after the populations have segregated for spawning is jointly modeled with telemetry distribution data by use of a likelihood function. maximization of the likelihood produces estimates of the abundance and timing of individual populations migrating through the capture area, thus yielding substantially more information than the total abundance estimate provided by the conventional approach. the utility of the model is illustrated with data for coho salmon o. kisutch from the kasilof river in south-central alaska."

relationship between fecal pellet counts and snowshoe hare density in western wyoming,density; fecal pellet; lepus americanus; mark-recapture; snowshoe hare; wyoming,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BERG ND;GESE EM,"snowshoe hares (lepus americanus) are an important prey species for canada lynx (lynx canadensis) and are considered critical for lynx population persistence. determination of snowshoe hare distribution and abundance is needed by land management agencies for lynx conservation. an accepted approach for estimating snowshoe hare abundance is the use of fecal-pellet plot counts. locally derived regression equations are preferred for accurate calibration of pellet counts to snowshoe hare density due to local differences in pellet deposition and decomposition. we used linear regression to examine correlations between snowshoe hare density, as determined by mark-recapture estimates, and pellet plot counts on both uncleared plots and annually cleared plots on the bridger-teton national forest, western wyoming, usa. we found significant correlations between snowshoe hare density estimates and fecal pellet counts for both uncleared and annually cleared pellet counts; however, the relationship was stronger (higher r) when using pellet counts from annually cleared plots. in addition, we found that adjusting the buffer size by omitting hard habitat edges (not used by hares) around trapping grids improved correlations between snowshoe hare density and fecal pellet counts for both uncleared plots and annually cleared plots. though precision is sacrificed when using uncleared plots, they may be useful as a coarse index of habitat use by snowshoe hares. our derived regression equations may be useful to identify important foraging habitat for canada lynx in western wyoming. land managers responsible for conserving snowshoe hare habitat in western wyoming may use these equations to monitor changes in hare populations among habitats and during prescribed management actions."
drought leads to collapse of black-tailed prairie dog populations reintroduced to the chihuahuan desert,black-tailed prairie dog; chihuahuan desert; conservation plan; cynomys ludovicianus; historic range; population collapse; population dynamics; reintroduction,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,FACKA AN;ROEMER GW;MATHIS VL;KAM M;GEFFEN E,"recently, a conservation strategy developed to restore populations of black-tailed prairie dog (cynomys ludovicianus) suggested reintroducing animals into the chihuahuan desert grasslands of the southwestern united states. rainfall in desert habitats is lower and more variable compared to rainfall near the center of the prairie dog's range. additionally, peak rainfall comes months after prairie dogs reproduce in these desert systems. thus, southwestern populations may be less prolific and fluctuate more than those found in northerly climes. using mark-recapture and mark-resight techniques, we estimated reproduction and monthly survival from 577 individuals inhabiting 6 reintroduced colonies from 2003 to 2005 in the northern chihuahuan desert. during 2003 precipitation was 64% of the long-term average, whereas both 2004 and 2005 had near-average precipitation. probability that a female became pregnant, number of juvenile prairie dogs emerging from maternity burrows, and date of emergence were all correlated to adult female body mass. adult monthly survival decreased from >0.95 during spring to 0.70 in summer 2003, following a rapid loss in adult body mass that coincided with low precipitation. in 2003 monthly juvenile survival was near zero on 2 of the 3 largest colonies and growth rates of juveniles were half that of subsequent years. estimated population size declined by 68% (range = 18-91%) from 2003 to 2004, and 5 of 6 populations declined an average of 75% from their original introduction size. prairie dog populations in desert environs may have a high risk of extirpation caused by weather patterns indicative of desert climates. our results are important for those managers involved in the conservation of prairie dogs and we suggest that regional differences should be carefully considered prior to any reintroduction effort."
population trends in northern spotted owls: associations with climate in the pacific northwest,adult survival; barred owl; climate; rate of population change; recruitment; strix occidentalis caurina; weather,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,GLENN EM;ANTHONY RG;FORSMAN ED,"we used reverse time capture-mark-recapture models to describe associations between rate of population change (lambda) and climate for northern spotted owls (strix occidentalis caurina) at six long-term study areas in washington and oregon, usa. populations in three of six areas showed strong evidence of declining populations, while populations in two additional areas were likely declining as well. at four areas. lambda was positively associated with wetter-than-normal conditions during the growing season, which likely affects prey availability. lambda was also negatively associated with cold, wet winters and nesting seasons, and the number of hot summer days. the amount of annual variation in lambda accounted for by climate varied across study areas (3-85%). rate of population change was more sensitive to adult survival than to recruitment: however, there was considerable variation among years and across study areas for all demographic rates. while annual survival was more closely related to regional climate conditions, recruitment was often associated with local weather. in addition to climate, declines in recruitment at four of six areas were associated with increased presence of barred owls. climate change models predict warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers for the pacific northwest in the first half of the 21st century. our results indicate that these conditions have the potential to negatively affect annual survival, recruitment, and consequently population growth rates for northern spotted owls.

effects of non-cropped landscape diversity on spatial dynamics of farmland birds in intensive farming systems,specialization; occupancy; colonization; farmland; non-cropped habitat diversity; france,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,CHIRON F;FILIPPI CODACCIONI O;JIGUET F;DEVICTOR V,"increasing habitats diversity in agricultural landscapes has been proposed as a key measure for reversing the decline of farmland biodiversity in europe. however, indicators used for assessing such a potential compensation effect usually only rely on species diversity and abundance while ignoring variations in species-specific vulnerability. the extent to which habitat diversity may reverse the decline of specialist species in europe to farming systems is thus still unclear. in this study, we investigate whether the effect of non-cropped habitat diversity on farmland birds' occurrences was dependent on species' specialization for habitats. in particular, we focused on the relative effects of non-cropped habitat diversity on species' abilities to persist or to colonize new vacant areas. we used a capture-recapture statistical framework to study the spatial dynamics of 20 farmland bird species in france monitored from 2001 to 2007. we found that non-cropped landscape diversity reduces both the probabilities that a species becomes extinct locally and that a species colonizes new vacant areas, and the occupancy rate. although this suggests a possible stabilizing effect of the surrounding habitat diversity on species occurrence in farming systems, the occupancy was only weakly affected. moreover, we found that the most specialist species were the more negatively affected by this landscape diversity in terms of colonization abilities. we argue that accounting for the differences in habitat specialization among farmland species can improve conservation policies dedicated to the management of landscape diversity.

"a regional approach for monitoring salmonid status and trends: results from a pilot study in coastal mendocino county, california",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,GALLAGHER SP;WRIGHT DW;COLLINS BW;ADAMS PB,"in coastal california, many evolutionarily significant units (esus) of chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha, coho salmon o. kisutch, and steelhead o. mykiss are listed under the federal endangered species act (esa). monitoring species status at the esu or esu subdivision scale requires specialized sampling. the purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate abundance estimated from a generalized random tessellation stratified (grts) design and compare the results with those from a more intensive stratified random monitoring program and (2) to evaluate the statistical power of the design to detect population trends. this 3-year pilot study considered five mendocino county streams as an example region of coastal california to evaluate a two-stage sampling approach for monitoring regional escapement. under this scheme, regional redd surveys (stage 1) were conducted in stream reaches in a grts sampling design. ten percent of anadromous habitat was sampled in year 1 and 10-35% in years 2 and 3. spawner : redd ratios were derived from smaller-scale census watersheds (stage 2) where ""true"" escapement was estimated using capture-recapture methods. regional escapement was then estimated from expanded redd counts, calibrated by spawner : redd ratios. as an alternative, more intensive method for estimating escapement, three survey streams were also sampled in a stratified random design. the results, added to counts from the census basins, produced more rigorous ""sum-of-streams'' estimates for comparison with the grts sampling. redd counts and the resulting escapement estimates were reliable for regional monitoring. the grts and sum-of-streams estimates overlapped, and the variation in the 95% confidence intervals did not change after 15%. our results suggest that a sample size of 15% or 41 or more reaches (whichever results in fewer survey reaches) should have adequate precision and statistical power to detect regional trends in salmon populations. we recommend that this monitoring approach be applied at regional spatial scales consistent with esa recovery planning efforts."
performance of spawner survey techniques at low abundance levels,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,GALLAGHER SP;ADAMS PB;WRIGHT DW;COLLINS BW,"population monitoring is essential to know whether coastal california's endangered species act-listed chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha, coho salmon o. kisutch, and steelhead o. mykiss stocks are progressing toward recovery. in coastal california, salmonids are at the southern edge of their range, and this one of many reasons they are not abundant. this provides unique challenges for monitoring, as different survey methods will result in estimates with different levels of accuracy and precision, which are important for evaluating population trends. for this study we intensively monitored three mendocino county watersheds to evaluate the reliability of two-stage data for monitoring regional escapement. under this scheme, regional spawning surveys (stage 1) were calibrated with data from intensively monitored watersheds (stage 2), where escapement was estimated using capture-recapture methods, redd counts, and fish counts. the objective of the study was to evaluate the quality of the stage 2 data for calibrating regional surveys. we evaluated the precision of live-fish capture-recapture estimates and compared these estimates with estimates derived from spawning survey data using carcass capture-recapture, area under the curve (auc), and redd counts. live-fish capture-recapture produced escapement estimates with narrower 95% confidence bounds where permanent structures were used to capture fish. redd counts converted to fish numbers using spawner : redd ratios were chosen for the regional salmonid monitoring method because they were reliable, economical, and less intrusive. converted redd counts were statistically and operationally similar to live-fish capture-recapture estimates but required fewer resources. the auc estimates were less reliable than converted redd counts and live-fish capture-recapture methods due to the sensitivity of the estimates of residence time and observer efficiency. finally, we found that carcass capture-recapture methods were operationally unsuccessful in coastal california streams. on the basis of our results, we recommend that annual spawner : redd ratios from intensively monitored watersheds be used to calibrate redd counts for regional status and trend monitoring of california's coastal salmonids."
comparison of electrofishing and snorkeling mark-recapture estimation of detection probability and abundance of juvenile steelhead in a medium-sized river,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,KORMAN J;DECKER AS;MOSSOP B;HAGEN J,"we compared nighttime electrofishing- and snorkeling-based mark-recapture methods for estimating the detection probability and abundance of juvenile steelhead oncorhynchus mykiss in the cheakamus river, british columbia. the reliability of abundance estimates largely depends on the precision and accuracy of detection probability (the fraction of marked individuals detected) as well as a few key assumptions of closed population models that we evaluated in this study. there was minimal bias (-2.5%) in diver estimates of the fork lengths of juvenile steelhead, and the relationship between measured and estimated fork lengths was very precise (r(2) = 95%). with a hierarchical bayesian model, estimates of the detection probability for smaller juveniles (40-60 mm) ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 with electrofishing and were near zero with snorkeling. in contrast, snorkeling-based detection probability was 0.6 and independent of size for larger juvenile steelhead (> 60 mm) and much greater than that with electrofishing. these results provide strong evidence that there is considerable individual heterogeneity in detection probability driven by fish size for both methods. owing to these differences, the abundance of age-0 steelhead based on snorkeling was underestimated by 50%, but that of larger, age-1 fish was unbiased and more precise (10-fold) than that based on electrofishing. the use of electrofishing during marking resulted in a substantive reduction in snorkeling-based detection probability during recapture, but the converse was not true. thus, there is strong evidence of behavioral heterogeneity in detection probability induced by electrofishing, but only when snorkeling is used to detect fish during recapture. the differences in detection probabilities among size-classes and sampling methods were probably driven by differences in concealment behavior, spatial distribution, and fright responses to sampling. our results indicate that snorkeling is the better way to estimate abundance for larger juvenile steelhead, whereas electrofishing is preferred for smaller fish."
effectiveness of night snorkeling for estimating steelhead parr abundance in a large river basin,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HAGEN J;DECKER S;KORMAN J;BISON RG,"the refinement of methodologies for estimating the abundance of juvenile salmonids in small streams has been an important area of fisheries research, but the development of methods suitable for larger streams has received insufficient attention. using a novel approach for obtaining marked populations of fish, we evaluated the effectiveness of night snorkeling counts for estimating the abundance of steelhead oncorhynchus mykiss parr in streams within a large river basin. sampled streams ranged from headwater tributaries with wetted widths of less than 10 m to a large, main-stem river with a wetted width approaching 100 m. estimates of snorkeling detection probability for steelhead parr were consistently high (overall mean = 0.65) and exhibited moderately low variability among sites (coefficient of variation = 0.24). detection probability exhibited a dome-shaped relationship to fork length and declined with increasing cross-sectional site area. the high and relatively consistent detection probabilities we estimated indicate that night snorkeling can be an effective technique for estimating the basinwide abundance of steelhead parr."

predation as a probable mechanism relating winter weather to population dynamics in a north american porcupine population,climate; fisher; predator-prey; seasonal survival; solar cycle; species interaction,POPULATION ECOLOGY,MABILLE G;DESCAMPS S;BERTEAUX D,"an abundance index of an eastern quebec population of north american porcupines (erethizon dorsatum) has cycled with superimposed periodicities of 11 and 22 years from 1868 to 2000. this cycle closely followed 11- and 22-year cycles in solar irradiance and local weather (e.g., winter precipitation and spring temperature), generating the hypothesis that solar activity may affect porcupine abundance through effects on local weather. we investigated the mechanisms linking porcupine abundance to local weather conditions using a 6-year study (2000-2005) involving individual mark-recapture, radio tracking, seasonal survival analyses and identification of mortality causes. summer (may-august) survival was high and constant over the study period, whereas winter (august-may) survival was lower and varied during the duration of our study. variations in local winter precipitation explained 89% of the variation in winter survival. porcupine predation rates appeared strongly related to snow conditions; 95% of depredated porcupines were killed when snow was covering the ground, and predation rates were higher in years with increased winter precipitation. our data thus support the hypothesis that changes in predation rates under different snow conditions were the mechanism relating climate to porcupine population dynamics, via modifications of the local predator-prey interactions and impacts on porcupine winter survival. our study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting an effect of climate on predator-prey processes. also, it identifies one possible mechanism involved in the relationship between solar irradiance and porcupine population cycles observed at this study site over a 130-year period."
determinants of partial bird migration in the amazon basin,bolivia; cerrado; flycatcher; seasonality; tyrannidae,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,JAHN AE;LEVEY DJ;HOSTETLER JA;MAMANI AM,"1. little is known about mechanisms that drive migration of birds at tropical latitudes. because most migratory bird species in south america have populations that are present year-round, partial migration (in which only some individuals of a given population migrate at the end of the breeding season) is likely to be common, providing an opportunity to assess proximate mechanisms of migration. 2. two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses explaining intraspecific variation in migratory behaviour were tested in a tropical kingbird tyrannus melancholicus population in the southern amazon basin, where a dramatic dry season decrease in the abundance of insect food for kingbirds may promote migration of some individuals. 3. the dominance hypothesis predicts sub-dominant individuals migrate at the end of the breeding season and dominant individuals do not, whereas the body size hypothesis predicts smaller individuals migrate and larger individuals do not. 4. based on 4 years of data on individually-marked birds, strong support was found for occurrence of partial migration in the study population. 5. in the best model, the largest males (which are typically older and dominant to younger individuals) had the highest probability of migrating. younger females (which are the smallest individuals in the population) were also more likely to migrate than other kingbirds, except the largest males. thus, an individual's probability of migrating was associated with a more complex interaction of size, age and sex than predicted by current hypotheses. 6. these results suggest that determinants of migratory behaviour differ between north temperate and tropical latitudes. most tests of partial migration theory have been conducted on granivores (e.g. emberizids) or omnivores (e.g. turdids and icterids) at north temperate latitudes, where seasonality is primarily defined by temperature cycles. in tropical south america, however, the most common long-distance migrants are primarily insectivorous (i.e. tyrannids), and seasonality is largely defined by rainfall cycles. 7. we propose a hypothesis based on seasonal food limitation to explain partial migration of primarily insectivorous species in seasonal tropical habitats."
empirical evidence of senescence in adult damselflies (odonata: zygoptera),ageing; akaike information criterion; field study; hazard; makeham; mark; odonata; winmodest; zygoptera,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,SHERRATT TN;LAIRD RA;HASSALL C;LOWE CD;HARVEY IF;WATTS PC;CORDERO RIVERA A;THOMPSON DJ,"p>1. age-dependent increases in mortality have been documented in a variety of species of insect under laboratory conditions. however, while strong statistical evidence has been presented for senescence in vertebrate populations in the wild, we know little about the rate and shape of senescence in wild populations of insects. 2. odonates (damselflies and dragonflies) provide excellent candidate species for evaluating demographic senescence as they are large enough to be marked individually and they are easily re-sighted without recapture. the prevailing opinion - based entirely on qualitative examination of the declines in log numbers alive with time since marking - is that odonates exhibit age-independent daily survivorship. 3. here, we examine mark-recapture data on the azure damselfly coenagrion puella over two consecutive seasons. for the first time, we evaluate and compare the fit of quantitative models that not only account for weather-dependent daily variation in daily re-sighting rates, but also age-dependent variation in daily survivorship. 4. models with age-dependent declines in daily survivorship provide a more parsimonious explanation for the data than similar models without these age-dependent effects. in general, models in which mortality increases in an exponential (gompertz) fashion explain the mark-recapture sequences more efficiently than a range of alternative models, including those in which mortality increases as a power function (weibull) or reaches a plateau (logistic). these results are indicative of a general senescent decline in physiological functioning, which is particularly marked after 15 days as a mature adult. 5. weather (temperature, sun and precipitation) and initial mite load influenced the probability of daily re-sighting. weather and mite load also influenced daily survivorship, but their effects differed between seasons. 6. overall, fitting models with age as an explicit covariate demonstrates that odonates do indeed senesce. this contradicts previously held assumptions that odonata do not exhibit age-dependent survivorship in the wild."
experience-dependent natal philopatry of breeding greater flamingos,breeding dispersal; ideal despotic distribution; intraspecific competition; m-surge; outbreeding; flyway; phenotype matching,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,BALKIZ O;BECHET A;ROUAN L;CHOQUET R;GERMAIN C;AMAT JA;RENDON MARTOS M;BACCETTI N;NISSARDI S;OZESMI U;PRADEL R,"p>1. contrary to the generally high level of natal philopatry (i.e. likelihood that individuals breed at their natal colony) found in first-breeding colonial birds, little is known of natal philopatry later in life. most hypotheses advanced to explain natal philopatry are valid at all ages. however, for young and inexperienced birds, the benefits of natal philopatry may be counterbalanced by the costs of intraspecific competition at the natal colony making dispersal temporarily advantageous. in turn, experience may increase competitive ability and make natal philopatry advantageous again. 2. we evaluated this hypothesis on the large-scale dispersal of greater flamingos phoenicopterus roseus breeding among three colonies comprising > 85% of the western mediterranean metapopulation. the camargue (france) and fuente de piedra (spain) are large and saturated colonies while molentargius (sardinia) is a recent and growing colony. 3. we used a 20-year capture-mark-resighting dataset of 4900 flamingos ringed as chicks in camargue and fuente de piedra and breeding at the three colonies. we assessed the effects of natal colony and breeding experience (first-time observed breeders versus confirmed experienced breeders) on dispersal using multistate capture-recapture models. dispersal to an unobservable state accounted for temporary emigration. 4. fidelity was higher at the natal colony (> 84%) than elsewhere. fidelity increased with experience in the two large colonies (camargue and fuente de piedra) suggesting a large-scale experience-related despotic distribution. breeding dispersal was significant (up to 61% and 52% for first-time breeders and experienced breeders, respectively) so that colony dynamics is affected by exchanges with other colonies. except for fuente-born breeders leaving molentargius, dispersal to the natal colony was higher than to any other colonies. 5. survival was not higher at the natal colony. inexperienced birds likely had lower breeding success at the camargue and skipped reproduction after having emigrated to the other large colony but not to molentargius. breeding at molentargius could allow avoiding queuing (and non-breeding) at the large colonies while gaining experience and competitive ability for future attempts. 6 natal philopatry appears as an important driver of large-scale breeding dispersal in the greater flamingo. the fitness advantage of natal philopatry is likely experience-dependent and mediated by the variations of intraspecific competition."

survival and breeding transitions for a reintroduced bison population: a multistate approach,badlands national park; bison bison; breeding state transition; culling; demography; mark-recapture; reintroduction,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,PYNE MI;BYRNE KM;HOLFELDER KA;MCMANUS L;BUHNERKEMPE M;BURCH N;CHILDERS E;HAMILTON S;SCHROEDER G;DOHERTY PF,"the iconic plains bison (bison bison) have been reintroduced to many places in their former range, but there are few scientific data evaluating the success of these reintroductions or guiding the continued management of these populations. relying on mark-recapture data, we used a multistate model to estimate bison survival and breeding transition probabilities while controlling for the recapture process. we tested hypotheses in these demographic parameters associated with age, sex, reproductive state, and environmental variables. we also estimated biological process variation in survival and breeding transition probabilities by factoring out sampling variation. the recapture rate of females and calves was high (0.78 +/- 0.15 [se]) and much lower for males (0.41 +/- 0.23), especially older males (0.17 +/- 0.15). we found that overall bison survival was high (>0.8) and that males (0.80 +/- 0.13) survived at lower rates than females (0.94 +/- 0.04), but as females aged survival declined (0.89 +/- 0.05 for f >= 15 yr old). lactating and non-lactating females survived at similar rates. we found that females can conceive early (approx. 1.5 yr of age) and had a high probability (approx. 0.8) of breeding in consecutive years, until age 13.5 years, when females that were non-lactating tended to stay in that state. our results suggest senescence in reproduction and survival for females. we found little support for the effect of climatic covariates on demographic rates, perhaps because the park's current population management goals were predicated from drought-year conditions. this reintroduction has been successful, but continued culling actions will need to be employed and an adaptive management approach is warranted. our demographic approach can be applied to other heavily managed large-ungulate systems with few or no natural predators."
persistence of colorado river cutthroat trout populations in isolated headwater streams of wyoming,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,COOK N;RAHEL FJ;HUBERT WA,"for populations of cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarkii, isolation in headwater streams may provide protection from invasion by nonnative species but also may enhance a population's vulnerability to extirpation. we assessed the risk of extirpation for eight colorado river cutthroat trout o. clarkii pleuriticus populations isolated above water diversion structures in the north fork little snake river drainage, wyoming. the populations had been isolated for 25-44 years, occupied headwater streams that ranged from 850 to 6,100 m in length, and had adult populations that were estimated to range from 12 to 506 fish. adult population sizes were compared with published occurrence models to identify populations that may be at risk of extirpation. one population had experienced an 11% annual rate of decline in abundance over the past 29 years, but there was no evidence of declines among the other populations. there was evidence of recruitment failure for age-1 fish in two of the smaller populations. abundance estimates and published logistic regression models consistently identified the largest tributary in the drainage as being the most likely to support a colorado river cutthroat trout population in the future and the smallest tributary as being the least likely to support a population in the future. the analyses indicated that isolated populations may persist for decades, but small effective population sizes can make populations vulnerable to eventual loss of genetic variability and to extirpation."
"abundance and recruitment of juvenile atlantic sturgeon in the altamaha river, georgia",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,SCHUELLER P;PETERSON DL,"juvenile atlantic sturgeon acipenser oxyrinchus remain in natal rivers for several years prior to out-migrating to marine environments during later portions of their life history. data regarding river-resident juvenile population dynamics are unknown. during the summers of 2004-2007, we performed mark-recapture of juvenile atlantic sturgeon in the altamaha river to assess age-specific abundance, apparent survival, per capita recruitment, and factors influencing recruitment. estimates indicated that juvenile abundance ranged from 1,072 to 2,033 individuals, and age-1 and age-2 individuals comprised greater than 87% of the juvenile population, while age-3 or older individuals constituted less than 13% of the population. estimates of apparent survival and per capita recruitment from pradel models indicated that the juvenile population experienced high annual turnover: apparent survival rates were low (<33%), and per capita recruitment was high (0.82-1.38). fall discharge, which had a positive relationship with recruitment, was the only factor assessed that significantly explained time variation in per capita recruitment. the findings of this study suggest that juvenile populations at the southern extreme of the atlantic sturgeon's range may remain in natal rivers for less time than northern counterparts. this is further evidence of life history differences between northern and southern populations of atlantic sturgeon. potential findings of density dependence could have major implications for both population recovery and management of this species."
integrated population modeling of black bears in minnesota: implications for monitoring and management,NA,PLOS ONE,FIEBERG JR;SHERTZER KW;CONN PB;NOYCE KV;GARSHELIS DL,"background: wildlife populations are difficult to monitor directly because of costs and logistical challenges associated with collecting informative abundance data from live animals. by contrast, data on harvested individuals (e. g., age and sex) are often readily available. increasingly, integrated population models are used for natural resource management because they synthesize various relevant data into a single analysis. methodology/principal findings: we investigated the performance of integrated population models applied to black bears (ursus americanus) in minnesota, usa. models were constructed using sex-specific age-at-harvest matrices (1980-2008), data on hunting effort and natural food supplies (which affects hunting success), and statewide mark-recapture estimates of abundance (1991, 1997, 2002). we compared this approach to downing reconstruction, a commonly used population monitoring method that utilizes only age-at-harvest data. we first conducted a large-scale simulation study, in which our integrated models provided more accurate estimates of population trends than did downing reconstruction. estimates of trends were robust to various forms of model misspecification, including incorrectly specified cub and yearling survival parameters, age-related reporting biases in harvest data, and unmodeled temporal variability in survival and harvest rates. when applied to actual data on minnesota black bears, the model predicted that harvest rates were negatively correlated with food availability and positively correlated with hunting effort, consistent with independent telemetry data. with no direct data on fertility, the model also correctly predicted 2-point cycles in cub production. model-derived estimates of abundance for the most recent years provided a reasonable match to an empirical population estimate obtained after modeling efforts were completed. conclusions/significance: integrated population modeling provided a reasonable framework for synthesizing age-at-harvest data, periodic large-scale abundance estimates, and measured covariates thought to affect harvest rates of black bears in minnesota. collection and analysis of these data appear to form the basis of a robust and viable population monitoring program."
impact of catch-and-release practices on behavior and mortality of atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.) kelts,fisheries management; angling; telemetry; post spawner,FISHERIES RESEARCH,HALTTUNEN E;RIKARDSEN AH;THORSTAD EB;NAESJE TF;JENSEN JLA;AAS O,"kelts of atlantic salmon (spent salmo solar l) are often caught and released (c&r) by anglers before and during their seaward migration in the river, but the extent of captures and the biological and management implications have not been previously evaluated. in this study, we investigate the impact of c&r on behavior and mortality of kelts by using telemetry. in total 73 atlantic salmon kelts were tagged with acoustic tags after angling in spring 2008 in the sub-arctic river alta, norway. they were tracked manually in the river and recorded during their initial marine migration on arrays of acoustic receivers deployed across the alta fjord up to 30 km from the river mouth. to increase the sample size - in order to reliably quantify capture rates of kelts during the recreational angling season - telemetry was combined with mark-recapture. recapture rates, behavior and survival of the angled and tagged kelts were compared to a control group of salmon (n = 17) tagged acoustically 7-10 months earlier, and therefore considered unaffected by recent angling and tagging. the recapture rate of the control group kelts (18%) did not differ from the recapture rate of the kelts tagged in spring (14%), and only a small proportion of the tagged kelts (2%) was recaptured more than once the same season. in total, 4% of the kelts died after c&r in the river and 92% migrated out the fjord on average 1 month after catch, tagging and release. the c&r fish descended the river slower than the uncaught control group, but no difference in the start of their marine migration, migration progression or survival was observed between the compared groups. we conclude that (1) c&r affected the post release behavior of kelts only by delaying the river descent, and (2) the delayed post release mortality rate of c&r kelts was not elevated despite the reduced energy levels and physiological condition of kelts. hence, releasing angled kelts can be a viable management strategy to enhance the return rate of repeat spawners.

assessing whether mortality is additive using marked animals: a bayesian state-space modeling approach,bayesian inference; cause-specific mortalities; compensatory mortality; depensatory mortality; mark-recapture; mixture of information; multistate models; ring-recoveries; wild boar,ECOLOGY,SERVANTY S;CHOQUET R;BAUBET E;BRANDT S;GAILLARD JM;SCHAUB M;TOIGO C;LEBRETON JD;BUORO M;GIMENEZ O,"whether different sources of mortality are additive, compensatory, or depensatory is a key question in population biology. a way to test for additivity is to calculate the correlation between cause-specific mortality rates obtained from marked animals. however, existing methods to estimate this correlation raise several methodological issues. one difficulty is the existence of an intrinsic bias in the correlation parameter. although this bias can be formally expressed, it requires knowledge about natural survival without any competing mortality source, which is difficult to assess in most cases. another difficulty lies in estimating the true process correlation while properly accounting for sampling variation. using a bayesian approach, we developed a state-space model to assess the correlation between two competing sources of mortality. by distinguishing the mortality process from its observation through dead recoveries and live recaptures, we estimated the process correlation. to correct for the intrinsic bias, we incorporated experts' opinions on natural survival. we illustrated our approach using data on a hunted population of wild boars. mortalities were not additive and natural mortality increased with hunting mortality likely as a consequence of non-controlled mortality by crippling loss. our method opens perspectives for wildlife management and for the conservation of endangered species."
effects of habitat patchiness on american lobster movement across a gradient of predation risk and shelter competition,american lobster; cobble; competition; habitat fragmentation; homarus americanus; movement; patchiness; predation; shelter,ECOLOGY,HOVEL KA;WAHLE RA,"the influence of landscape structure on marine ecological processes is receiving increasing attention. however, few studies conducted in coastal marine habitats have evaluated whether the effects of landscape structure on species interactions and organismal behavior are consistent across the range of an organism, over which landscape context and the strength of species interactions typically vary. american lobster (homarus americanus) juveniles seek refuge from predators within shallow rocky habitat but make short-distance movements to forage outside of shelter. we evaluated how the patchiness of cobble habitat influences juvenile lobster movement by conducting mark-recapture experiments on lobsters placed within patchy and contiguous cobble plots in three regions of new england among which risk of predation and intraspecific shelter competition vary (rhode island, mid-coast maine, and eastern maine, usa). we also evaluated whether habitat patchiness influenced lobster colonization of plots and whether lobster fidelity to individual shelters corresponds to variability in predator abundance and conspecific density among regions. cobble patchiness reduced rates of lobster movement in all three regions in 2004 and in two of three regions in 2005, despite large differences in landscape context among regions. region had much larger effects on lobster colonization than did patchiness, but patchy plots were colonized at higher rates than were contiguous plots where lobster densities were highest. fidelity to shelter was higher in regions with low conspecific density (rhode island and eastern maine) than in mid-coast maine where conspecific density is high and where unmarked lobsters often occupied shelters vacated by marked lobsters. our results indicate that cobble patchiness influences juvenile lobster movement at small scales, but that the effects of patchiness on movement were consistent across much of the range of the american lobster despite strong regional variation in predator abundance and conspecific density."
evaluation of procedures to reduce bias in fish growth parameter estimates resulting from size-selective sampling,von bertalanffy; growth; bias; gear selectivity,FISHERIES RESEARCH,GWINN DC;ALLEN MS;ROGERS MW,"size-selective fish sampling can strongly bias von bertalanffy growth parameter estimates. bias-correction methods have been developed, but they often require previous knowledge of selectivity pattern, capture-recapture data or intensive age-growth sampling over multiple consecutive years. when corrective measures are not feasible, investigators have attempted a number of biologically based procedures to reduce this bias. we evaluated several existing biologically based procedures that could potentially remove bias from growth parameter estimates. we built an age and length structured population model and tested the utility of four procedures to remove bias: 1) fixing to at zero, 2) deleting data associated with ages that are not fully vulnerable to sampling, 3) deleting less than fully vulnerable ages and fixing to at zero, and 4) fixing l(similar to), at the maximum value observed in the data. we considered sampling gears that had no size selectivity, asymptotic selectivity. and dome-shaped selectivity patterns for all procedures. results suggested that none of these procedures would eliminate bias in growth parameters across all three gear selectivity patterns. investigators should attempt to use methods to correct growth parameters for size selectivity of sampling gears (e.g., mark recapture methods). if such corrections are not feasible, prior information about the size selectivity pattern of sampling gears is necessary for informed selection of biologically based von bertalanffy fitting procedures.

"parent age, lifespan and offspring survival: structured variation in life history in a wild population",ageing; capture-mark-recapture; early life effects; individual quality; longevity; population growth rate; state-dependent life history,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,REID JM;BIGNAL EM;BIGNAL S;MCCRACKEN DI;BOGDANOVA MI;MONAGHAN P,"p>1. understanding the degree to which reproductive success varies with an individual's age and lifespan, and the degree to which population-level variation mirrors individual-level variation, is central to understanding life-history evolution and the dynamics of age-structured populations. we quantified variation in the survival probability of offspring, one key component of reproductive success and fitness, in relation to parent age and lifespan in a wild population of red-billed choughs (pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax). 2. on average across the study population, the first-year survival probability of offspring decreased with increasing parent age and lifespan; offspring of old parents were less likely to survive than offspring of young parents, and offspring of long-lived parents were less likely to survive than offspring of short-lived parents. 3. however, survival did not vary with parent age across offspring produced by groups of parents that ultimately had similar lifespans. 4. rather, across offspring produced by young parents, offspring survival decreased with increasing parent lifespan; parents that ultimately had long lifespans produced offspring that survived poorly, even when these parents were breeding at young ages. 5. the average decrease in offspring survival with increasing parent age observed across the population therefore reflected the gradual disappearance of short-lived parents that produced offspring that survived well, not age-specific variation in offspring survival within individual parents. 6. the negative correlation between offspring survival and maternal lifespan was strongest when environmental conditions meant that offspring survival was low across the population. 7. these data suggest an environment-dependent trade-off between parent and offspring survival, show consistent individual variation in the resolution of this trade-off that is set early in a parent's life, and demonstrate that such structured life-history variation can generate spurious evidence of senescence in key fitness components when measured across a population."
"small-scale dispersal and survival in a long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross",colony size; conspecific attraction; fidelity to colony; philopatry,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,GAUTHIER G;MILOT E;WEIMERSKIRCH H,"p>1. dispersal is a fundamental but still poorly known process in population dynamics and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain its patterns. we studied natal and breeding dispersal and survival in a long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross (diomedea exulans l.), and examined several hypotheses concerning dispersal patterns in birds. 2. we applied multi-state capture-recapture models to a 36-year data set (1969-2004) collected at three albatross colonies on ile de possession, crozet islands. because the species has biennial reproduction, we introduced unobservable states in the model to account for the absence of individuals in those years. 3. adults were highly faithful to their nesting colony but colony fidelity, as well as survival rate, differed slightly among colonies (fidelity ranged from 0 center dot 957 to 0 center dot 977). breeding fidelity was highest in the colony where survival was lowest and individuals were not more likely to change colony following a failed breeding attempt than after a successful one. the colony that attracted most dispersers had the lowest density of nesting birds. 4. philopatry (the probability that young return to breed at a birth site) was generally high but variable among colonies (ranging from 0 center dot 70 to 0 center dot 92), and survival of young differed little. philopatry was highest in the largest colony, where the availability of potential mates was presumably greatest. however, among dispersing individuals, the colony that had the lowest density of nesting individuals, not the largest colony, attracted the most recruits. 5. although size of the colony influenced the decision to stay or to leave in young, density was most influential in the selection of a new colony among both adult and young dispersers. our results support the hypothesis that philopatry is the strategy favoured by most recruits and that conspecific attraction can explain variation in the level of philopatry among colonies but not settlement patterns among dispersing individuals."

three-pass depletion sampling accuracy of two electric fields for estimating trout abundance in a low-conductivity stream with limited habitat complexity,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,HABERA JW;KULP MA;MOORE SE;HENRY TB,"we evaluated three-pass depletion sampling for both ac and pulsed-dc electrofishing for estimating the population size of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss in a representative low-conductivity (20-mu s/cm) southern appalachian stream with limited habitat complexity. trout capture efficiencies in such streams could be expected to exceed those observed in streams in which habitat is more complex; thus, depletion estimates could be much more accurate in the former. we also compared the results for two trout length-groups to investigate size-related differences. measured capture efficiency was 0.88 +/- 0.04 (95% confidence interval) for trout greater than 100 mm (typically adults) and 0.65 +/- 0.09 for trout less than 100 mm (age 0). population size was underestimated in each depletion sample. the errors for trout over 100 mm were generally small (mean, 12%; range, 3-23%), and the upper 95% confidence limits were usually within 10% of the true population size (n). underestimates of n were larger for trout under 100 mm (mean, 32%; range, 5-60%), although the upper 95% confidence limits were within 20% of the n for half of the samples. the results of a laboratory study confirmed that trout over 100 mm were immobilized at significantly lower voltage gradients than were smaller trout in both electric fields. we conclude that three-pass depletion sampling is relatively accurate in typical southern appalachian trout streams and that the underestimation errors for rainbow trout larger than 100 mm would be acceptable given basic inventory and monitoring goals."

estimating individual survival using territory occupancy data on unmarked animals,bayesian analysis; capture recapture; common birds census; robust design; state-space models; territory colonization; territory fidelity; winbugs,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,ROTH T;AMRHEIN V,"p>1. survival estimation forms the basis of much ecological research, and usually requires data on marked animals. in population studies of territorial animals, however, data are often collected on animal territory occupancy without identification of individuals. previously, these data could not be used to estimate demographic parameters such as survival. 2. we developed a hierarchical site-occupancy model for estimating survival from territory occupancy data without individual identification. we defined survival as the probability that an individual occupying a territory survives until the next reproductive period and settles in the same territory again. to evaluate our model, we used simulated data as well as real data from a long-term study on nightingales luscinia megarhynchos, from which mark-recapture data and territory occupancy data were available. 3. when applied to simulated data sets on territory occupancy, with parameter settings that are typical for different monitoring programmes (i.e. 10 years duration, three or eight visits per season, and 55 or 200 territories surveyed), our model yielded unbiased estimates of survival if the probability of detecting an occupied territory during a single visit was p = 0 center dot 5 or p = 0 center dot 7. 4. when applied to the data on nightingale territory occupancy, estimates of survival from our model were very similar to the estimates obtained from a traditional mark-recapture model (cormack-jolly-seber model) applied to the ringing data from the same nightingale population. 5.synthesis and applications. data collection for mark-recapture analysis is usually invasive and labour intensive, and suitable data are rarely available from large-scale monitoring programmes covering entire regions or countries. applying our model to territory occupancy data from such monitoring programmes could make large amounts of data available for research on animal demography."
estimation of immigration rate using integrated population models,athene noctua; bayesian; capture-recapture; identifiability; population counts; reproductive success; survival; state-space model,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,ABADI F;GIMENEZ O;ULLRICH B;ARLETTAZ R;SCHAUB M,"p>1. the dynamics of many populations is strongly affected by immigrants. however, estimating and modelling immigration is a real challenge. in the past, several methods have been developed to estimate immigration rate but they either require strong assumptions or combine in a piecewise manner the results from separate analyses. in most methods the effects of covariates cannot be modelled formally. 2. we developed a bayesian integrated population model which combines capture-recapture data, population counts and information on reproductive success into a single model that estimates and models immigration rate, while directly assessing the impact of environmental covariates. 3. we assessed parameter identifiability by comparing posterior distributions of immigration rates under varying priors, and illustrated the application of the model with long term demographic data of a little owl athene noctua population from southern germany. we further assessed the impact of environmental covariates on immigration. 4. the resulting posterior distributions were insensitive to different prior distributions and dominated by the observed data, indicating that the immigration rate was identifiable. average yearly immigration into the little owl population was 0 center dot 293 (95% credible interval 0 center dot 183-0 center dot 418), which means that ca 0 center dot 3 female per resident female entered the population every year. immigration rate tended to increase with increasing abundance of voles, the main prey of little owls. 5.synthesis and applications. the means to estimate and model immigration is an important step towards a better understanding of the dynamics of geographically open populations. the demographic estimates obtained from the developed integrated population model facilitate population diagnoses and can be used to assess population viability. the structural flexibility of the model should constitute a useful tool for wildlife managers and conservation ecologists."
"movement and habitat selection by argia vivida (hagen) (odonata, coenagrionidae) in fuel-modified forest",odonata; fuel management; habitat; dispersal; movement,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,KORTELLO AD;HAM SJ,"fuel management for wildfire protection is becoming increasingly common in the wildland-urban interface and may have conservation implications for species with restricted distributions and limited dispersal abilities. to evaluate the impact of forest fuel management on the damselfly argia vivida at the northern margin of its range, we examined terrestrial movements and habitat associations using capture-mark-recapture and point count techniques. we found that habitats away from the springs were particularly important for a. vivida females. most damselflies travelled at least 50 m between capture and recapture and patches of cleared forest up to this size did not pose a barrier to movement. although a. vivida typically roosts in trees at night, cleared fuel treatment areas were preferred over unmodified or thinned forest as daytime basking and foraging sites. preferred sites were also characterized by heterogeneous canopy closure, i.e., a clearing adjacent to unmodified forest with a closed canopy. we speculate that this behaviour derives from the species' thermoregulation requirements; the use of sunspots for thermal basking during the day and the use of forest cover at night to slow the radiant loss of heat. our findings demonstrate the scale of movements that define available habitat and the importance of both daytime and night time habitat requirements in considering terrestrial foraging and movement corridors. consequently, conservation efforts for this species in fuel management areas should focus on maintaining unmodified stands of dense trees in association with cleared patches of appropriate dimension, rather than a uniformly thinned forest."
"effects of narrow roads on the movement of carabid beetles (coleoptera, carabidae) in nopporo forest park, hokkaido",fragmentation; barrier; mark-recapture; road ecology,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,YAMADA Y;SASAKI H;HARAUCHI Y,"forest-dwelling carabid beetles that have no flight ability were studied using mark-recapture methods in late-june to mid-october 2007. this study was done to determine the effects of narrow roads in nopporo forest park, hokkaido on carabid beetle movement and habitat use. the investigation was conducted at four sites: one site was an abandoned grassy road with a width of 3.5 m, two sites were gravel roads with widths of 3.5 and 4.5 m, and another site was an asphalt-paved road with a width of 4.5 m. a total of 3,580 individuals from six species of carabid beetles were collected using dry pit-fall traps, and recapture rates ranged from 6.1 to 36.2%. all examined roads acted as barriers against the movement of leptocarabus arboreus ishikarinus. all roads, except the abandoned grassy road, acted as a barrier against carabus granulatus yezoensis movement. forest-roadside verge comparisons demonstrated that some carabid beetles avoid even narrow roadside verges. harmful effects increase with increasing road width and both paved roads and narrow roads negatively affect the movement of carabid beetles inhabiting the bordering forest. therefore, forest specialist beetles are influenced by a barrier effect that starts at the forest road verge, and this barrier effect may be exacerbated by vehicular traffic. therefore, these barrier effects on carabid beetles should be considered when planning and implementing road construction and maintenance in forests."
use of portable antennas to estimate abundance of pit-tagged fish in small streams: factors affecting detection probability,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,O DONNELL MJ;HORTON GE;LETCHER BH,"portable passive integrated transponder (pit) tag antenna systems can be valuable in providing reliable estimates of the abundance of tagged atlantic salmon salmo salar in small streams under a wide range of conditions. we developed and employed pit tag antenna wand techniques in two controlled experiments and an additional case study to examine the factors that influenced our ability to estimate population size. we used pollock's robust-design capture-mark-recapture model to obtain estimates of the probability of first detection (p), the probability of redetection (c), and abundance (n) in the two controlled experiments. first, we conducted an experiment in which tags were hidden in fixed locations. although p and c varied among the three observers and among the three passes that each observer conducted, the estimates of n were identical to the true values and did not vary among observers. in the second experiment using free-swimming tagged fish, p and c varied among passes and time of day. additionally, estimates of n varied between day and night and among age-classes but were within 10% of the true population size. in the case study, we used the cormack-jolly-seber model to examine the variation in p, and we compared counts of tagged fish found with the antenna wand with counts collected via electrofishing. in that study, we found that although p varied for age-classes, sample dates, and time of day, antenna and electrofishing estimates of n were similar, indicating that population size can be reliably estimated via pit tag antenna wands. however, factors such as the observer, time of day, age of fish, and stream discharge can influence the initial and subsequent detection probabilities."
"lake sturgeon population status and demography in the kettle river, minnesota, 1992-2007",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,DIETERMAN DJ;FRANK J;PAINOVICH N;STAPLES DF,"we assessed population status and estimated selected demographic parameters for lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens in the kettle river, minnesota, using capture-recapture tagging data collected from 1992 to 2007. the lake sturgeon is an imperiled species of special concern in minnesota, with population declines attributed to overfishing, pollution, and establishment of dams. in 1995, the recreational fishery was closed and the only dam on the kettle river (sandstone dam) was removed, in part to promote lake sturgeon recovery. recent incidental capture of lake sturgeon by anglers is prompting interest in re-opening the recreational fishery. we gathered information to determine (1) status and demography of the kettle river population, (2) the effect of dam removal, and (3) the feasibility of re-opening the recreational fishery. open-population capture-recapture models were used to examine population status and estimate survival, seniority, and the relative importance of survival and recruitment for influencing population trends. the rate of population change (lambda) indicated that the population was barely maintaining itself (average lambda across years 1.02; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.86-1.16). annual population estimates ranged from about 130 fish to almost 300 fish but had wide cis. similarly, estimates of new lake sturgeon entering the population each year (either from within-population recruitment or immigration) were variable and ranged from 0 to over 100. annual survival was nearly constant at about 80%. growth was slow relative to other populations but averaged about 28 mm/year for ages 6-21. a seniority parameter indicated that 49-87% of individuals in the population in a given year consisted of population members that survived from the previous year. this suggested that the population was essentially maintaining itself through a combination of episodic recruitment and relatively constant survival. recent low recruitment may be due to a short-term disturbance from sediment released when the dam was removed in 1995. maintaining closure of the recreational fishery still appears necessary. bolstering of recruitment may be needed to increase the population. full recovery will require patience for this long-lived, late-maturing, infrequently reproducing species."
estimation and modeling of electrofishing capture efficiency for fishes in wadeable warmwater streams,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,PRICE AL;PETERSON JT,"stream fish managers often use fish sample data to inform management decisions affecting fish populations. fish sample data, however, can be biased by the same factors affecting fish populations. to minimize the effect of sample biases on decision making, biologists need information on the effectiveness of fish sampling methods. we evaluated single-pass backpack electrofishing and seining combined with electrofishing by following a dual-gear, mark-recapture approach in 61 blocknetted sample units within first-to third-order streams. we also estimated fish movement out of unblocked units during sampling. capture efficiency and fish abundances were modeled for 50 fish species by use of conditional multinomial capture recapture models. the best-approximating models indicated that capture efficiencies were generally low and differed among species groups based on family or genus. efficiencies of single-pass electrofishing and seining combined with electrofishing were greatest for catostomidae and lowest for ictaluridae. fish body length and stream habitat characteristics (mean cross-sectional area, wood density, mean current velocity, and turbidity) also were related to capture efficiency of both methods, but the effects differed among species groups. we estimated that, on average, 23% of fish left the unblocked sample units, but net movement varied among species. our results suggest that (1) common warmwater stream fish sampling methods have low capture efficiency and (2) failure to adjust for incomplete capture may bias estimates of fish abundance. we suggest that managers minimize bias from incomplete capture by adjusting data for site-and species-specific capture efficiency and by choosing sampling gear that provide estimates with minimal bias and variance. furthermore, if block nets are not used, we recommend that managers adjust the data based on unconditional capture efficiency."
"effects of a conservative rock bass length limit on angler participation, sport fish populations, and crayfish prey in a missouri ozark stream",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,ROELL MJ;DISTEFANO RJ,"rock bass ambloplites rupestris are popular with anglers in missouri ozark streams, second only to smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu. historically, fishery biologists emphasized the management of smallmouth bass, but in the late 1980s they sought higher-quality rock bass fisheries and thus the information needed to recommend harvest regulations. using a conservative minimum length limit of 230 mm (9 in) total length (tl) in a heavily exploited rock bass fishery in the big piney river, missouri, we assessed the direct and indirect effects on angler participation and attitudes (by means of an angler survey), the abundance (mark-recapture analysis) and growth rates (scale analysis) of rock bass and smallmouth bass, sport fish predation on crayfishes (order decapoda; diet analysis), and crayfish densities (stratified quadrat sampling). these measures were evaluated for 3 years (1992-1994) before the length limit was imposed and for 6 years afterward (1995-2000) on a 17.1-km-long regulation section and a 10.4-km-long reference section. our results indicate that the length limit (1) had substantial angler support, as shown by their attitudes and compliance with the regulation; (2) reduced the hours fished by rock bass anglers, smallmouth bass anglers, and all anglers; (3) increased the abundances of larger rock bass and smallmouth bass substantially; (4) did not reduce the growth rates of rock bass or smallmouth bass; (5) did not proportionally reduce the predation on crayfishes or increase the percentage of empty stomachs; and (6) did not reduce the densities of crayfishes. after a review of the options for long-term management, fishery administrators and managers elected to manage big piney river rock bass with a minimum-tl regulation of 205 mm (8 in) on 124 km of river. managers on five other rivers (one with shadow bass a. ariommus) have done likewise on an additional 448 km, and the outcomes of these decisions are currently being monitored on all six rivers."

breeding dispersal in black-headed gull: the value of familiarity in a contrasted environment,buffer effect; coloniality; emigration; e-surge; larus,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,PERON G;LEBRETON JD;CROCHET PA,"p>1. some species (e.g. migratory species with high movement ability) are unlikely to experience any physical cost when dispersing, at least at the landscape scale. in these species dispersal is nevertheless behaviourally constrained to avoid non-physical costs such as the loss of familiarity with the breeding environment, and these constraints can be maladaptive in a fast-changing environment. 2. we evaluated such constraints using multievent modelling of a 20-year capture-mark-recapture data set from a multisite population of black-headed gull (chroicocephalus ridibundus). the population undertakes seasonal migrations that are very large compared with the size of the study area. 3. distances between colonies appeared as a strong predictor of breeding adults' dispersal rates, confirming behavioural constraints on dispersal. in addition, birds that had recruited outside their colony of birth (natal dispersers) tended to return to their colony of birth later in life (long-term memory effect). 4. an attraction for larger colonies was also visible in breeding adult dispersal patterns. the fact that distance and memory still constrained dispersal although the largest colony provided higher breeding success indicated departures from the ideal-free distribution, probably linked with the lack of information about distant colonies. moreover, the regional population apparently functioned as a meta-colony where individuals frequently bred in suboptimal-choice locations before being able to recruit in their preferred colony."
pulsed resources affect the timing of first breeding and lifetime reproductive success of tawny owls,age at first breeding; cost of reproduction; information-theoretic approach; population cycles; survival,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,MILLON A;PETTY SJ;LAMBIN X,"p>1. according to life-history theory, environmental variability and costs of reproduction account for the prevalence of delayed reproduction in many taxa. empirical estimates of the fitness consequences of different ages at first breeding in a variable environment are few however such that the contributions of environmental and individual variability remains poorly known. 2. our objectives were to elucidate processes that underpin variation in delayed reproduction and to assess lifetime consequences of the age of first breeding in a site-faithful predator, the tawny owl strix aluco l. subjected to fluctuating selection linked to cyclical variation in vole density (typically 3-year cycles with low, increasing and decreasing vole densities in successive years). 3. a multistate capture-recapture model revealed that owl cohorts had strikingly different juvenile survival prospects, with estimates ranging from 0 center dot 08 to 0 center dot 33 respectively for birds born in decrease and increase phases of the vole cycle. this resulted in a highly skewed population structure with > 75% of local recruits being reared during increase years. in contrast, adult survival remained constant throughout a vole cycle. the probability of commencing reproduction was lower at age 1 than at older ages, and especially so for females. from age 2 onwards, pre-breeders had high probabilities of entering the breeding population. 4. variation in lifetime reproductive success was driven by the phase of the vole cycle in which female owls started their breeding career (26-47% of variance explained, whether based on the number of local recruits or fledglings), more than by age at first breeding or by conditions experienced at birth. females who postponed reproduction to breed for the first time at age 3 during an increase phase, produced more recruits, even when accounting for birds that may have died before reproduction. no such effects were detected for males. 5. sex-specific costs of early reproduction may have accounted for females being more prone to delay reproduction. contrary to expectations from a best-of-a-bad job strategy, early-hatched, hence potentially higher-quality females were more likely to breed at age 1, but then experienced rapidly declining food resources and so seemed caught in a life-history trap set by the multiannual vole cycle."
dynamic heterogeneity and life history variability in the kittiwake,fixed heterogeneity; life history evolution; stage-structured demography; lifetime reproductive success; multi-stage matrix model,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,STEINER UK;TULJAPURKAR S;ORZACK SH,p>1. understanding the evolution of life histories requires an assessment of the process that generates variation in life histories. within-population heterogeneity of life histories can be dynamically generated by stochastic variation of reproduction and survival or be generated by individual differences that are fixed at birth. 2. we show for the kittiwake that dynamic heterogeneity is a sufficient explanation of observed variation of life histories. 3. the total heterogeneity in life histories has a small contribution from reproductive stage dynamics and a large contribution from survival differences. we quantify the diversity in life histories by metrics computed from the generating stochastic process. 4. we show how dynamic heterogeneity can be used as a null model and also how it can lead to positive associations between reproduction and survival across the life span. 5. we believe our approach to identifying the nature of among-individual heterogeneity yields important insights into the forces that generate within-population variation of life-history traits. it provides an alternative to claims that fixed individual differences are a major determinant of heterogeneity in life histories.
hierarchical modelling and estimation of abundance and population trends in metapopulation designs,bayesian; poisson glmm; hierarchical model; population dynamics; population trends; winbugs,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,KERY M;ROYLE JA,"p>1. population assessment in changing environments is challenging because factors governing abundance may also affect detectability and thus bias observed counts. we describe a hierarchical modelling framework for estimating abundance corrected for detectability in metapopulation designs, where observations of 'individuals' (e.g. territories) are replicated in space and time. we consider two classes of models; first, we regard the data as independent binomial counts and model abundance and detectability based on a product-binomial likelihood. secondly, we use the more complex detection-non-detection data for each territory to form encounter history frequencies, and analyse the resulting multinomial/poisson hierarchical model. importantly, we extend both models to directly estimate population trends over multiple years. our models correct for any time trends in detectability when assessing population trends in abundance. 2. we illustrate both models for a farmland and a woodland bird species, skylark alauda arvensis and willow tit parus montanus, by applying them to swiss bbs data, where 268 1 km2 quadrats were surveyed two to three times during 1999-2003. we fit binomial and multinomial mixture models where log(abundance) depended on year, elevation, forest cover and transect route length, and logit(detection) on year, season and search effort. 3. parameter estimates were very similar between models with confidence intervals overlapping for most parameters. trend estimates were similar for skylark (-0.074 +/- 0.041 vs. -0.047 +/- 0.019) and willow tit (0.044 +/- 0.046 vs. 0.047 +/- 0.018). as expected, the multinomial model gave more precise estimates, but also yielded lower abundance estimates for the skylark. this may be due to effects of territory misclassification (lumping error), which do not affect the binomial model. 4. both models appear useful for estimating abundance and population trends free from distortions by detectability in metapopulation designs with temporally replicated observations. the ability to obtain estimates of abundance and population trends that are unbiased with respect to any time trends in detectability ought to be a strong motivation for the collection of replicate observation data."

edge behaviour in a minute parasitic wasp,advection-diffusion models; anagrus; dispersal; edge behaviour; landscape; prokelisia,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,REEVE JD;CRONIN JT,"p>1. changes in the density of an organism near a boundary elements (edge effects) are often thought to be generated by changes in movement behaviour, but in most cases the mechanism underlying these effects is unknown. 2. we quantified the movement behaviour of a minute parasitic wasp, anagrus columbi, in relation to edges in its habitat. this wasp attacks eggs of the planthopper prokelisia crocea, which inhabits a wet prairie ecosystem composed of patches of its host plant prairie cordgrass (spartina pectinata) interspersed within a matrix of mudflat, smooth brome (bromus inermis) and native grasses. two edge types are common in this system, cordgrass-mudflat and cordgrass-brome. 3. we conducted mark-recapture experiments in which wasps were released at the cordgrass-matrix edge and 50 cm within cordgrass or matrix, for both edge types. the marked wasps were recaptured using a grid of sticky traps. we fitted an advection-diffusion model to these data, yielding estimates of the diffusion rate and advection coefficient for cordgrass and matrix, for each release position and edge type. 4. the spatial distribution of wasps was well-described by the advection-diffusion model. the pattern suggests that marked wasps strongly biased their movements towards the edge when released in matrix, and to a lesser extent when released in cordgrass, while edge releases showed little bias. the advection coefficients were similar for the two edge types, as were the diffusion rates for the three substrates (cordgrass, brome, mudflat). the diffusive and advective components of movement were of comparable magnitude for matrix and cordgrass releases, suggesting equal amounts of directed and random movement. 5. our results suggest the wasps are attracted to cordgrass patches across short distances, and that bias in their movements may concentrate them at the patch edge. their edge behaviour is qualitatively different from that of the host insect. 6. the methodology described here could be readily adapted to other systems, where direct observations of movement are difficult but mark-recapture studies are feasible."

site fidelity of the declining amphibian rana sierrae (sierra nevada yellow-legged frog),NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,MATTHEWS KR;PREISLER HK,"from 1997 to 2006, we used mark-recapture models to estimate the site fidelity of 1250 sierra nevada yellow-legged frogs (rana sierrae) in kings canyon national park, california, usa, during their three main activity periods of overwintering, breeding, and feeding. to quantify site fidelity, the tendency to return to and reuse previously occupied habitats, we used multistrata models (with water bodies as the strata) and potential function analyses. the probability of returning to previously used water bodies during all activity periods was typically greater than 80% and always greater than the probability of moving to other water bodies. site fidelity models (with lake-specific movement transitions) were favored over those models that held movement transitions equal between lakes. potential function analyses demonstrated that frogs were most strongly attracted to their original capture lakes rather than moving to the nearest available breeding or overwintering lake. under current disturbances in high-elevation sierra nevada lakes (exotic trout, climate change), site fidelity is problematic because frogs return to lakes subject to drying or those with fish rather than dispersing to other lakes. future recovery of declining species will need to focus efforts towards restoring habitats when animals maintain strong site fidelity even when their habitats deteriorate."

empirical comparison of density estimators for large carnivores,american black bear; carnivore; density estimation; edge effect; geographic closure; spatially explicit capture-recapture; ursus americanus,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,OBBARD ME;HOWE EJ;KYLE CJ,"1. population density is a critical ecological parameter informing effective wildlife management and conservation decisions. density is often estimated by dividing capture-recapture (c-r) estimates of abundance ((n) over cap) by size of the study area, but this relies on the assumption of geographic closure - a situation rarely achieved in studies of large carnivores. for geographically open populations (n) over cap is overestimated relative to the size of the study area because animals with only part of their home range on the study area are available for capture. this bias ('edge effect') is more severe when animals such as large carnivores range widely. to compensate for edge effect, a boundary strip around the trap array is commonly included when estimating the effective trap area ((a) over cap). various methods for estimating the width of the boundary strip are proposed, but (n) over cap/(a) over cap estimates of large carnivore density are generally mistrusted unless concurrent telemetry data are available to define (a) over cap. remote sampling by cameras or hair snags may reduce study costs and duration, yet without telemetry data inflated density estimates remain problematic. 2. we evaluated recently developed spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) models using data from a common large carnivore, the american black bear ursus americanus, obtained by remote sampling of 11 geographically open populations. these models permit direct estimation of population density from c-r data without assuming geographic closure. we compared estimates derived using this approach to those derived using conventional approaches that estimate density as (n) over cap/(a) over cap. 3. spatially explicit c-r estimates were 20-200% lower than densities estimated as (n) over cap/(a) over cap. aic(c) supported individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities and home range sizes. variable home range size could not be accounted for when estimating density as (n) over cap/(a) over cap. 4. synthesis and applications. we conclude that the higher densities estimated as (n) over cap/(a) over cap compared to estimates from secr models are consistent with positive bias due to edge effects in the former. inflated density estimates could lead to management decisions placing threatened or endangered large carnivores at greater risk. such decisions could be avoided by estimating density by secr when bias due to geographic closure violation cannot be minimized by study design."

estimating survival and migration route probabilities of juvenile chinook salmon in the sacramento-san joaquin river delta,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,PERRY RW;SKALSKI JR;BRANDES PL;SANDSTROM PT;KLIMLEY AP;AMMANN A;MACFARLANE B,"juvenile chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha emigrating from natal tributaries of the sacramento river must negotiate the sacramento-san joaquin river delta, a complex network of natural and man-made channels linking the sacramento river with san francisco bay. natural processes and water management actions affect the fractions of the population using the different migration routes through the delta and survival within those routes. however, estimating these demographic parameters is difficult using traditional mark-recapture techniques, which depend on the physical recapture of fish (e. g., coded wire tags). thus, our goals were to (1) develop a mark-recapture model to explicitly estimate the survival and migration route probabilities for each of four migration routes through the delta, (2) link these route-specific probabilities to population-level survival, and (3) apply this model to the first available acoustic telemetry data of smolt migration through the delta. the point estimate of survival through the delta for 64 tagged fish released in december 2006 ((s) over cap (delta) = 0.351; se = 0.101) was lower than that for 80 tagged fish released in january 2007 ((s) over cap (delta) = 0.543; se = 0.070). we attributed the observed difference in survival between releases to differences in survival for given migration routes and changes in the proportions of fish using the different routes. our study shows how movements among, and survival within, migration routes interact to influence population-level survival through the delta. thus, concurrent estimation of both route-specific migration and survival probabilities is critical to understanding the factors affecting population-level survival in a spatially complex environment such as the delta."

long- and short-term influence of environment on recruitment in a species with highly delayed maturity,black-browed albatross; breeding decision; natal conditions; environmental variability; immature survival,OECOLOGIA,NEVOUX M;WEIMERSKIRCH H;BARBRAUD C,"short-term effects of environmental perturbations on various life history traits are reasonably well documented in birds and mammals. but, in the present context of global climate change, there is a need to consider potential long-term effects of natal conditions to better understand and predict the consequences of these changes on population dynamics. the environmental conditions affecting offspring during their early development may determine their lifetime reproductive performance, and therefore the number of recruits produced by a cohort. in this study, we attempted to link recruitment to natal and recent (previous year) conditions in the long-lived black-browed albatross (thalassarche melanophrys) at kerguelen islands. the environmental variability was described using both climatic variables over breeding (sea surface temperature anomaly) and non-breeding grounds (southern oscillation index), and variables related to the colony (breeding success and colony size). immature survival was linked to the breeding success of the colony in the year of birth, which was expected to reflect the average seasonal parental investment. at the cohort level, this initial mortality event may act as a selective filter shaping the number, and presumably the quality (breeding frequency, breeding success probability), of the individuals that recruit into the breeding population. the decision to start breeding was strongly structured by the age of the individuals and adjusted according to recent conditions. an effect of natal conditions was not detected on this parameter, supporting the selection hypothesis. recruitment, as a whole, was thus influenced by a combination of long- and short-term environmental impacts. our results highlight the complexity of the influence of environmental factors on such long-lived species, due to the time-lag (associated with a delayed maturity) between the impact of natal conditions on individuals and their repercussion on the breeding population."

influence of climate and reproductive timing on demography of little brown myotis myotis lucifugus,breeding probability; capture-recapture; climate change; robust design,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,FRICK WF;REYNOLDS DS;KUNZ TH,"1. estimating variation in demographic rates, such as survival and fecundity, is important for testing life-history theory and identifying conservation and management goals. 2. we used 16 years (1993-2008) of mark-recapture data to estimate age-specific survival and breeding probabilities of the little brown myotis myotis lucifugus leconte in southern new hampshire, usa. using kendall & nichols' (1995) full-likelihood approach of the robust design to account for temporary emigration, we tested whether survival and breeding propensity is influenced by regional weather patterns and timing of reproduction. 3. our results demonstrate that adult female survival of m. lucifugus ranged from 0.63 (95% cl = 0.56, 0.68) to 0.90 (95% cl = 0.77, 0.94), and was highest in wet years with high cumulative summer precipitation. first-year survival [range: 0.23 (95% cl = 0.14, 0.35) to 0.46 (95% cl = 0.34, 0.57)] was considerably lower than adult survival and depended on pup date of birth, such that young born earlier in the summer (c. late may) had a significantly higher probability of surviving their first year than young born later in the summer (c. mid-july). similarly, the probability of young females returning to the maternity colony to breed in the summer following their birth year was higher for individuals born earlier in the summer [range: 0.23 (95% cl = 0.08, 0.50) to 0.53 (95% cl = 0.30, 0.75)]. 4. the positive influence of early parturition on 1st-year survival and breeding propensity demonstrates significant fitness benefits to reproductive timing in this temperate insectivorous bat. 5. climatic factors can have important consequences for population dynamics of temperate bats, which may be negatively affected by summer drying patterns associated with global climate change. 6. understanding long-term demographic trends will be important in the face of a novel disease phenomenon (white-nose syndrome) that is associated with massive mortalities in hibernating bat species, including m. lucifugus, in the northeastern united states."
habitat-specific differences in adult survival rates and its links to parental workload and on-nest predation,cavity nesting; dispersal; farmland bird; parental effort; predation risk,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,LOW M;ARLT D;EGGERS S;PART T,"p>1. adult survival rates strongly affect population growth, but few studies have quantified if and why adult survival differs between breeding habitats. we investigated potential causes of habitat-specific adult survival rates for male and female northern wheatears (oenanthe oenanthe l.) breeding in swedish farmland. 2. we used multistate mark-recapture models based on 1263 breeding records between 1993 and 2007 to estimate survival rates based on habitat-type (short vs. tall ground vegetation) and breeding-success state parameters. we also used breeding-season observations from 2002 to 2007 and an experimental manipulation of ground vegetation height to identify factors influencing adult mortality. 3. females had lower annual survival than males (0 center dot 42 +/- 0 center dot 02 vs. 0 center dot 50 +/- 0 center dot 02); this difference largely resulted from low female survival in tall habitats because of higher nest-predation risk and the large proportion of adult females being killed on the nest (> 20%) during nest predation events. 4. among successful breeders, both sexes displayed similar survival rates, but survival was lower for breeders in tall as compared to short habitats (0 center dot 43 +/- 0 center dot 03 vs. 0 center dot 51 +/- 0 center dot 02). experimental manipulation of ground vegetation height, controlling for individual and territory quality (n = 132), suggested the cost of rearing young to be higher in tall habitats (survival of successful breeders in tall vs. short; 0 center dot 43 +/- 0 center dot 11 vs. 0 center dot 57 +/- 0 center dot 05). 5. detailed observations of food provisioning behaviour during chick rearing revealed a habitat-related difference in parental workload corresponding to the observed habitat differences in adult survival for successful breeders. adults breeding in tall habitats were forced to forage further from the nest relative to short-habitat breeders (mean +/- se; 69 +/- 10 vs. 21 +/- 2 m), which increased the estimated daily workload for adults in tall vs. short habitats by c. 20%. 6. on-nest predation and parental workload during chick rearing combine to largely explain habitat-specific adult survival rates. the results have implications for our understanding of adult sex ratios, causes of source-sink demography and habitat-specific growth rates. furthermore, it suggests short field margins and other residual habitat elements to be important for the conservation of farmland passerines breeding in cropland plains."
demographic parameters of rural and urban adult resident canada geese in georgia,band recovery; branta canadensis; burnham model; harvest; mark-recapture; program mark; recovery; resident canada geese; survival,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BALKCOM GD,"in many urban metropolitan areas, resident canada goose (branta canadensis) populations have grown to nuisance levels in spite of increasing harvest opportunity. to document differences in demographic parameters between urban and rural geese, i estimated probabilities of survival, recapture, recovery, and fidelity for adult resident canada geese between 2001 and 2006 using banding, live recapture, and dead recovery data from 2 distinct banding locations in georgia, usa. adult survival rates were higher for urban geese (0.958, se = 0.020) than for rural geese (0.682, se = 0.049). using estimated recovery probabilities of 0.505 (se = 0.107) for urban and 0.463 (se = 0.045) for rural geese, along with current estimates of crippling loss and reporting rate, the estimated mean harvest rate for urban geese was 0.029 (se = 0.006) and for rural geese was 0.202 (se = 0.020). fidelity rates were similar between urban (0.730, se = 0.033) and rural geese (0.713, se = 0.069). this information suggests that urban segments of the canada goose population have substantially higher survival than rural geese and are harvested at a very low rate, and that liberalizing hunting regulations may have little impact on georgia's urban goose population. wildlife managers may need to consider options other than sport hunting to control nuisance goose populations in urban areas."
survival and fidelity of an enclosed white-tailed deer population using capture-recapture-reporting data,dispersal; emigration; high-tensile electric fence; immigration; mortality; odocoileus virginianus,POPULATION ECOLOGY,WEBB SL;GEE KL;WANG GM,"the number of animal populations enclosed by impermeable fences has increased, which poses issues related to the behavior of individuals and populations. despite the increased number of fenced enclosures, there is a paucity of survival and fidelity data on white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) from fenced enclosures. therefore, we examined marked deer recaptures and resightings over 13 years for an enclosed population of white-tailed deer in oklahoma, usa, to estimate survival and fidelity parameters. we found that a step model was the best model of survival for both sexes. survival of females and males was greater after hunting was suspended. average female survival was 77% before hunting was suspended but increased to 98% after. male survival was also greater after (99%) hunting was suspended compared to before (58%). females exhibited greater site fidelity (84-94%) than males for all age groups except old individuals, which showed similar site fidelities for males and females. fidelity was highest for old males (85%), followed by adult (74%), fawn (61%), and yearling males (56%). our high-tensile electric fence allowed management goals to be achieved through increased survival while potentially maintaining genetic diversity through the exchange of limited numbers of individuals from surrounding areas. however, if the goal is to confine deer to limit disease spread or protect sensitive areas (e.g., airports) from deer encroachment, then other fence designs may be necessary, because our fence was not completely effective at controlling deer movements for these purposes."
"spatial and temporal patterns of upriver migration by sockeye salmon populations in the wood river system, bristol bay, alaska",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,DOCTOR KK;HILBORN R;ROWSE M;QUINN T,"knowledge of temporal segregation in migration timing among populations is critical for management of fisheries that exploit a complex of populations with an overlap in timing. we examined the potential for fishery selection on populations of sockeye salmon oncorhynchus nerka in the wood river system, bristol bay, alaska, by determining the relationship between migration timing (hence, vulnerability to fishing) and the population of origin and breeding date. we assessed migration patterns among populations with a multiyear mark-recapture study testing the hypotheses that the timing of upriver migration varies systematically with respect to spawning habitat, lake of origin, and spawning population. the results revealed organization in migration timing through the wood river among populations spawning in the streams, beaches, and rivers of the system. the primary source of variation in migration timing among populations was spawning habitat and, to a lesser extent, the lake of origin. stream-spawning populations migrated before river-spawning populations, consistent with the earlier spawning in streams than in rivers. however, beach-spawning populations were among the earliest to migrate, yet they spawned as late as river spawners. a likelihood model revealed that spawn timing was not tightly coupled with migration timing by populations through the wood river, and there was broad overlap in migration timing among spawning populations. results also revealed a link between migration timing and arrival on spawning grounds within a population that was intensively sampled, indicating that early upriver migrants also tended to enter the spawning grounds before later-migrating individuals. fisheries that are selective with respect to timing can have strong effects on the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the populations under such pressure, and the phenomenon of temporally biased fisheries merits further investigation."
road crossing designs and their impact on fish assemblages of great plains streams,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,BOUSKA WW;PAUKERT CP,"a mark-recapture field study was conducted to determine fish passage at 5 concrete box culverts and 5 low-water crossings (concrete slabs vented by culverts) as well as 10 control sites (below a natural riffle) in flint hills streams of northeastern kansas. additionally, we tested the upstream passage of four fish species native to great plains streams (topeka shiner notropis topeka, green sunfish lepomis cyanellus, red shiner cyprinella lutrensis, and southern redbelly dace phoxinus erythrogaster) through three simulated crossing designs (box culverts, round corrugated culverts, and natural rock riffles) at water velocities of 0.1 to 1.1 m/s in an experimental stream. the field study indicated that cyprinids were twice as likely to move upstream of box culverts than low-water crossings and 1.4 times as likely to move upstream of control reaches than any crossing type. the best models indicated that the proportion of cyprinids that moved upstream increased with decreased culvert slope and length, perching, and increased culvert width. our controlled experiment indicated that fish can move through velocities up to 1.1 m/s in a 1.86-m simulated stream and that the proportion of fish that moved upstream did not differ among crossing designs for southern redbelly dace, green sunfish, or topeka shiner; however, natural rock riffles had lower proportional movements (mean 0.19) than the box (0.38) or corrugated culvert designs (0.43) for red shiners. water velocity did not affect the proportional upstream movement of any species except that of topeka shiners, which increased with water velocity. crossing design alone may not determine fish passage, and water velocities up to 1.1 m/s may not affect the passage of many great plains fishes. barriers to fish movement may be the result of other factors (e. g., perching, slope, and crossing length). the use of properly designed and installed crossings has promise in conserving great plains stream fishes."
population age structure of the spotted tree frog (litoria spenceri): insights into population declines,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,GILLESPIE G,"context. despite increased scientific attention on amphibian conservation in recent years, knowledge of population demography of amphibians remains scarce, hampering evaluation of population declines and development of appropriate management responses. aims. the aims of this research were to examine variation in population demography of the spotted tree frog (litoria spenceri), a critically endangered species in australia, and to evaluate the role of various factors potentially responsible for population declines such as introduced trout, chytridiomycosis and habitat changes. methods. skeletochronology combined with mark-recapture sampling were undertaken in two different river systems, bogong creek and taponga river, to determine population age structure. age-specific survival estimates were derived from each population and were then used to examine variance in age-specific mortality. key results. relative population density per 200 m of stream was 67.7 adults and 131.3 juveniles at bogong creek and 10.7 adults and 33.8 juveniles at taponga river. ages were determined for 578 frogs across the two populations. age-specific survival was lowest in the first year of life compared to all other age classes, and highest in sexually mature adults. differences in age-specific survival were similar between the populations, with the exception of first-year survivorship, which averaged 1.9% at bogong creek and 0.4% at taponga river. this difference was large enough to explain most of the marked difference in population density between the two streams. key conclusions. the difference in first-year age-specific survival is consistent with trout predation as the most parsimonious explanation for the large differences in population density between the populations, and lends further weight to the role of introduced trout in the decline of this species. implications. this study has contributed to informing management actions for conservation of this species, and demonstrates that population age structure data may provide valuable insights into demographic variability within and between populations and species. this may have important implications for interpretation of population declines, and conservation and management responses."
"advancement to hair-sampling surveys of a medium-sized mammal: dna-based individual identification and population estimation of a rare australian marsupial, the spotted-tailed quoll (dasyurus maculatus)",NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,RUIBAL M;PEAKALL R;CLARIDGE A;MURRAY A;FIRESTONE K,"context. enumeration of cryptic/rare or widely distributed mammal species is exceedingly difficult for wildlife managers using standard survey methods. individual identification via non-invasive hair-dna methods offers great promise in extending the information available from hairs collected to survey for presence/absence of a species. however, surprisingly few wildlife studies have attempted this because of potential limitations with the field method and genetic samples. aim. the applicability of hair dna to identify individuals and estimate numbers was assessed for a rare, medium-sized australian marsupial carnivore, the spotted-tailed quoll (dasyurus maculatus). methods. hair samples were obtained remotely in the field with baited hair-sampling devices (known as handi-glaze hair tubes) that permit multiple visitations by individuals and species. a hierarchical approach developed and applied to the dna extraction and pcr protocol, based on single and four pooled hairs of each collected sample, was used to assess genotype reliability (cross-species dna mixing, allelic dropout and false allele errors) and enumerate the local study population. these results were compared against a concurrent live-cage trapping survey that was equivalent in scale and trap density to enable a rigorous evaluation of the efficiency and reliability of the dna-based hair-sampling technique. key results. of the 288 hair devices deployed, 52 (18%) captured spotted-tailed quoll hair and the majority (90%) of these samples provided adequate dna to genetically profile individuals at 10 microsatellite loci and a sexing marker. the hierarchical approach provided a feasible way to verify whether cross-species dna mixing had occurred in the pooled-hair dna extracts by comparing the results against the independent single-hair dna extract, and assess genotyping reliability of both dna concentrations. fewer individuals were detected using hair-sampling (n = 16) than live-trapping (n = 21), despite hair-sampling occurring over a longer period (40 cf. 26 nights). conclusions. the population-level information gained by the dna-based technologies adds considerable value to the remote hair-sampling method which up until the present study had been used to detect the presence of medium-sized mammals. our study demonstrated the utility of the dna-based hair-sampling method to identify spotted-tailed quoll individuals and for surveying local populations. however, improvements to the hair-sampling method, such as increasing the density of stations or the provision of a food reward, should be considered to enhance sampling efficiency to allow the enumeration of local populations. implications. the use of remote hair-sampling devices that permit multiple visitations and do not require daily collection can be feasible and reliable to genetically identify individuals when coupled with appropriate strategies. by combining single-and pooled-hair dna extracts, a good compromise between laboratory efficiency and data integrity is afforded."
primary and secondary resource pulses in an alpine ecosystem: snow tussock grass (chionochloa spp.) flowering and house mouse (mus musculus) populations in new zealand,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,WILSON DJ;LEE WG,"context. rodent populations in many parts of the world fluctuate in response to resource pulses generated by periodic high seed production (masting) by forest trees, with cascading effects on predation risk to other forest species. in new zealand forests, populations of exotic house mice (mus musculus) irrupt after periodic heavy beech (nothofagus spp.) seedfall. however, in alpine grasslands, where snow tussock grasses (chionochloa spp.) also flower and set seeds periodically, little is known about house mouse population dynamics. aims. our primary objective was to test for an increase in alpine mouse density following a summer when snow tussocks flowered profusely. we also estimated mouse density in adjacent montane forest over 2 years, and assessed mouse diet, to predict their potential impacts on native species. methods. flowering intensity of chionochloa was assessed by counting flowering tillers on permanent transects (2003-06). mouse density was estimated with capture-mark-recapture trapping in alpine (2003-07) and forest (2003-04) habitats. mice were also collected and their stomach contents analysed. flowering or fruiting of alpine shrubs and herbs, and beech seedfall at forest sites, were also measured. key results. chionochloa flowered profusely in austral summer 2005/06. between autumn (may) and spring (november) 2006, mean alpine mouse density increased from 4 ha(-1) to 39 ha(-1), then declined to 8 ha(-1) by autumn (may 2007). no mice were captured in 768 trap-nights during the following spring (november 2007). prior to the mouse irruption, mouse density was consistently higher at alpine (0.4-4.0 mice ha(-1)) than at montane forest (0.02-1.8 mice ha(-1)) sites (in 2003-04). alpine mouse diet was dominated by arthropods before mast flowering, and by seeds during it. conclusions. the density and dynamics of alpine mice in relation to intensive snow-tussock flowering were similar to those in new zealand beech forest in relation to beech masts. implications. we predict the timing and duration of periods of heightened predation risk to native alpine fauna, as the result of pulses in mouse density and likely associated pulses in the density of stoats (mustela erminea), a key exotic predator."
does a benign calicivirus reduce the effectiveness of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (rhdv) in australia? experimental evidence from field releases of rhdv on bait,benign calicivirus; biological control; elisa; epidemiology; genetic sequencing; mark-recapture; myxomatosis; protective antibody; rhdv; survival,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,MUTZE G;SINCLAIR R;PEACOCK D;KOVALISKI J;CAPUCCI L,"context. european rabbits are serious environmental and agricultural pests throughout their range in australia. rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (rhdv) greatly reduced rabbit numbers in arid central australia but had less impact in cooler, higher-rainfall areas. rhdv-like benign caliciviruses (bcvs) have been implicated in limiting the impact of rhdv in the higher-rainfall regions of australia and also in europe. aims. experimental releases of rhdv on bait were tested as a means of initiating disease outbreaks. serological evidence of antibodies to bcvs was examined to determine whether they reduce mortality rates and/or spread of the released rhdv, and how that might influence the effectiveness of future rhdv releases for rabbit management. methods. four experimental releases were conducted in high-rainfall and coastal regions of southern australia. virus activity was implied from recapture rates and serological changes in marked rabbits, and genetic sequencing of virus recovered from dead rabbits. changes in rabbit abundance were estimated from spotlight transect counts. key results. release of rhdv on bait produced disease outbreaks that challenged almost all animals within the general release area and spread up to 4 km beyond the release sites. recapture rates were high in marked rabbits that possessed antibodies from previous exposure to rhdv and extremely low amongst rabbits that lacked any detectable antibodies. rabbits carrying antibodies classified as being due to previous infection with bcvs had recapture rates that were dependent on circulating antibody titre and were similar to 55% of recapture rates in rabbits with clear antibodies to rhdv. conclusions. this is the first quantified evidence that antibodies produced against bcvs provide significant protection against rhd outbreaks in field populations of rabbits. implications. bcvs can greatly reduce the impact of rhdv on wild-rabbit populations in australia and presumably elsewhere. rhdv can be effectively released on bait although further releases are likely to be of minor or inconsistent benefit for controlling rabbit numbers where bcvs are common."
the effects of parasitism on recapture rates of wood mice (apodemus sylvaticus),cmr; heterogeneity; nutritional control of parasitism; population sampling,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,COLTHERD JC;MORGAN C;JUDGE J;SMITH LA;HUTCHINGS MR,"context. in studies of population dynamics, disease ecology and prevalence, point-sampling of data is a widely used sampling technique and capture-mark-recapture (cmr) is the most popular method of point sampling. population estimates based on cmr are sensitive to deviations from the assumptions of the models such as equal catchability of all animals. although consistent deviations from these assumptions can be accounted for in a robust statistical framework (e. g. identification of trap-shy animals), transient effects cannot be adequately incorporated in the statistical models and thus are expected to affect the accuracy of model predictions. in natural animal populations, parasitism is often transient but inevitable and studies showing behavioural changes, e. g. foraging strategies, as a result of infection are numerous. thus, parasitism may represent a transient source of heterogeneity of trapping probability in small mammal populations and may affect accuracy of wildlife sampling techniques. aims. the aim of the present study was to quantify the effect of parasitic status on capture rates of wood mice (apodemus sylvaticus), and thus the potential for parasitism to act as a source of bias in wildlife sampling techniques such as cmr. methods. in total, 41 wood mice were successfully captured, marked and released from two study sites in two different years, with weight, sex and faecal egg counts (fec; used as a measure of the level of parasitism) recorded at every capture. key results. in both studies, fec was positively correlated with the capture rate of mice and the number of different traps in which an individual was caught. conclusions. we conclude that parasitism affects the rate of capture of wood mice and has the potential to represent a significant source of heterogeneity in trapping probability. implications. the consistent results of these two small studies suggest that wildlife point-sampling techniques may be biased by the parasitic status of the animals, which has potentially significant and far-reaching implications for wildlife population studies and disease-prevalence studies."
a comparison of the effectiveness of camera trapping and live trapping for sampling terrestrial small-mammal communities,camera trapping; cost effectiveness; small mammal; survey methods; trapping,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,DE BONDI N;WHITE JG;STEVENS M;COOKE R,"context. there is an increasing reliance on the use of camera-trap technologies for surveys of medium to large terrestrial mammals. camera trapping may, however, also have significant applications for broad-scale surveys of small mammals. aims. the present study aims to compare results from camera-trapping surveys to those of the more traditional live-trapping techniques. specifically, it aims to test the effectiveness of the techniques for detecting species, and the cost effectiveness of both approaches. methods. surveys were conducted across 36 sites in the grampians national park, victoria, australia, between april and july 2009. at each site, independent surveys were conducted for small mammals by using a combination of elliot and cage trapping, then camera trapping. results for the two different approaches were compared for both their ability to generate small-mammal presence data and their cost effectiveness. key results. camera-trapping surveys of 36 sites in the grampians national park compared favourably with those of live-trapping surveys. similar species were detected across the sites, and camera trapping was a considerably more cost effective than live trapping. conclusions. camera-trapping surveys of small terrestrial mammals may provide a new and cost-effective technique for surveying terrestrial small mammals. this is particularly the case when presence data are the main requirement of the survey, with no requirement to capture and tag animals. implications. given the cost-effective nature of camera trapping, there is potential to use this approach to increase the level of replication and spatial coverage of small-mammal surveys. improving the replication and spatial coverage of studies has the potential to significantly increase the scope of research questions that can be asked, thus providing the potential to improve wildlife management."
transmission dynamics of tasmanian devil facial tumor disease may lead to disease-induced extinction,basic reproductive number r-0; conservation biology; extinction; facial tumor disease; pathogen transmission; sarcophilus harrisii; tasmanian devil,ECOLOGY,MCCALLUM H;JONES M;HAWKINS C;HAMEDE R;LACHISH S;SINN DL;BEETON N;LAZENBY B,"most pathogens threatening to cause extinction of a host species are maintained on one or more reservoir hosts, in addition to the species that is threatened by disease. further, most conventional host-pathogen theory assumes that transmission is related to host density, and therefore a pathogen should become extinct before its sole host. tasmanian devil facial tumor disease is a recently emerged infectious cancer that has led to massive population declines and grave concerns for the future persistence of this largest surviving marsupial carnivore. here we report the results of mark-recapture studies at six sites and use these data to estimate epidemiological parameters critical to both accurately assessing the risk of extinction from this disease and effectively managing this disease threat. three sites were monitored from before or close to the time of disease arrival, and at three others disease was well established when trapping began, in one site for at least 10 years. we found no evidence for sex-specific differences in disease prevalence and little evidence of consistent seasonal variation in the force of infection. at all sites, the disease was maintained at high levels of prevalence (>50% in 2-3-year-old animals), despite causing major population declines. we also provide the first estimates of the basic reproductive rate r-0 for this disease. using a simple age-structured deterministic model, we show that our results are not consistent with transmission being proportional to the density of infected hosts but are consistent with frequency-dependent transmission. this conclusion is further supported by the observation that local disease prevalence in 2-3-year-olds still exceeds 50% at a site where population density has been reduced by up to 90% in the past 12 years. these findings lend considerable weight to concerns that this host-specific pathogen will cause the extinction of the tasmanian devil. our study highlights the importance of rapidly implementing monitoring programs to determine how transmission depends on host density and emphasizes the need for ongoing management strategies involving a disease-free ""insurance population,'' along with ongoing field monitoring programs to confirm whether local population extinction occurs."
trend estimation in populations with imperfect detection,abundance; binomial mixture model; detectability; glm; hierarchical model; lizard; metapopulation design; monitoring; trend,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,KERY M;DORAZIO RM;SOLDAAT L;VAN STRIEN A;ZUIDERWIJK A;ROYLE JA,"p>1. trends of animal populations are of great interest in ecology but cannot be directly observed owing to imperfect detection. binomial mixture models use replicated counts to estimate abundance, corrected for detection, in demographically closed populations. here, we extend these models to open populations and illustrate them using sand lizard lacerta agilis counts from the national dutch reptile monitoring scheme. 2. our model requires replicated counts from multiple sites in each of several periods, within which population closure is assumed. counts are described by a hierarchical generalized linear model, where the state model deals with spatio-temporal patterns in true abundance and the observation model with imperfect counts, given that true state. we used winbugs to fit the model to lizard counts from 208 transects with 1-10 (mean 3) replicate surveys during each spring 1994-2005. 3. our state model for abundance contained two independent log-linear poisson regressions on year for coastal and inland sites, and random site effects to account for unexplained heterogeneity. the observation model for detection of an individual lizard contained effects of region, survey date, temperature, observer experience and random survey effects. 4. lizard populations increased in both regions but more steeply on the coast. detectability increased over the first few years of the study, was greater on the coast and for the most experienced observers, and highest around 1 june. interestingly, the population increase inland was not detectable when the observed counts were analysed without account of detectability. the proportional increase between 1994 and 2005 in total lizard abundance across all sites was estimated at 86% (95% cri 35-151). 5.synthesis and applications. open-population binomial mixture models are attractive for studying true population dynamics while explicitly accounting for the observation process, i.e. imperfect detection. we emphasize the important conceptual benefit provided by temporal replicate observations in terms of the interpretability of animal counts."
bird population density estimated from acoustic signals,acoustic localization; bird counting; density estimation; microphone array; passive acoustic methods; sound attenuation; spatially explicit capture-recapture,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,DAWSON DK;EFFORD MG,"p>1. many animal species are detected primarily by sound. although songs, calls and other sounds are often used for population assessment, as in bird point counts and hydrophone surveys of cetaceans, there are few rigorous methods for estimating population density from acoustic data. 2. the problem has several parts - distinguishing individuals, adjusting for individuals that are missed, and adjusting for the area sampled. spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) is a statistical methodology that addresses jointly the second and third parts of the problem. we have extended secr to use uncalibrated information from acoustic signals on the distance to each source. 3. we applied this extension of secr to data from an acoustic survey of ovenbird seiurus aurocapilla density in an eastern us deciduous forest with multiple four-microphone arrays. we modelled average power from spectrograms of ovenbird songs measured within a window of 0 center dot 7 s duration and frequencies between 4200 and 5200 hz. 4. the resulting estimates of the density of singing males (0 center dot 19 ha-1 se 0 center dot 03 ha-1) were consistent with estimates of the adult male population density from mist-netting (0 center dot 36 ha-1 se 0 center dot 12 ha-1). the fitted model predicts sound attenuation of 0 center dot 11 db m-1 (se 0 center dot 01 db m-1) in excess of losses from spherical spreading. 5.synthesis and applications. our method for estimating animal population density from acoustic signals fills a gap in the census methods available for visually cryptic but vocal taxa, including many species of bird and cetacean. the necessary equipment is simple and readily available; as few as two microphones may provide adequate estimates, given spatial replication. the method requires that individuals detected at the same place are acoustically distinguishable and all individuals vocalize during the recording interval, or that the per capita rate of vocalization is known. we believe these requirements can be met, with suitable field methods, for a significant number of songbird species."

"effects of temporary tributary use on escapement estimates of adult fall chinook salmon in the deschutes river, oregon",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,NAUGHTON GP;JEPSON MA;PEERY CA;BRUN CV;GRAHAM JC,"international managers use escapement estimates of the deschutes river, oregon, population of fall chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha to forecast abundance and assess population health. fish are externally marked in the deschutes river, and a subsample of the marked fish is recovered on the spawning grounds to provide data for estimating escapement. escapement would be overestimated if some of the marked fish exited the deschutes river prior to spawning (i.e., used this tributary temporarily). we used mark-recapture and radiotelemetry techniques to calculate (1) the proportion of adult fall chinook salmon that entered the deschutes river and subsequently exited the river prior to spawning and (2) the effect of such temporary entrances on spawning ground escapement estimates. we used separate criteria to calculate maximum and minimum temporary tributary use rates, which were then used to adjust the escapement estimates made with external-tag data alone. over the 3 years of study, the adjusted estimates were approximately 4-29% lower than the unadjusted estimates. we conclude that failure to adjust escapement estimates for temporary tributary use might lead to inflated harvest targets. to partially account for temporary tributary use, the lower 95% confidence limit for an escapement estimate could be used to regulate harvest."

(2008) used data from different populations and different years to estimate detection probabilities for both p. elongatus and p. stormi, a decision which assumes that detection probabilities do not differ across sites and populations are closed. in addition, welsh et al. (2008) present count data for both salamanders, a metric that assumes capture probability does not vary by age, gender, size, other individual characteristics, and most importantly in their application, habitat characteristics. welsh et al.

(2008) was an index of body condition, i.e., the residuals of a least squares regression of mass on the length. several recent articles have outlined a number of potential problems with the technique and a theoretically more robust and efficient alternative has been published. unfortunately, welsh et al. (2008) did not provide the details (model diagnostic statistics, tests of assumptions) needed to assess whether or not their analyses of body condition may be accurate. we think that evaluation of specific hypotheses, well-designed sampling programs, and methods such as mark-recapture and ratio sampling are more likely to provide reliable inference than re-analysis of old data sets that were collected for other purposes and obsolete methods (i.e.. counting individuals on single occasions) that are known to be flawed. we agree that potential forest management impacts to sensitive taxa require evaluation and monitoring, and that changes in occupancy and abundance are useful metrics for this task (while recognizing that, when feasible to collect, information about reproductive success and survival is superior). however, reliable inference about potential impacts can only be made if reliable methods are employed and if critical assumptions receive empirical evaluation. we offer several suggestions to strengthen inference about management treatments.

habitat-specific breeder survival of florida scrub-jays: inferences from multistate models,aphelocoma coerulescens; capture-recapture; disturbance; fire; florida scrub-jay; multistate models; patch dynamics; restoration; scrub; survival,ECOLOGY,BREININGER DR;NICHOLS JD;CARTER GM;ODDY DM,"quantifying habitat-specific survival and changes in habitat quality within disturbance-prone habitats is critical for understanding population dynamics and variation in fitness, and for managing degraded ecosystems. we used 18 years of color-banding data and multistate capture-recapture models to test whether habitat quality within territories influences survival and detection probability of breeding florida scrub-jays (aphelocoma coerulescens) and to estimate bird transition probabilities from one territory quality state to another. our study sites were along central florida's atlantic coast and included two of the four largest metapopulations within the species range. we developed markov models for habitat transitions and compared these to bird transition probabilities. florida scrub-jay detection probabilities ranged from 0.88 in the tall territory state to 0.99 in the optimal state; detection probabilities were intermediate in the short state. transition probabilities were similar for birds and habitat in grid cells mapped independently of birds. thus, bird transitions resulted primarily from habitat transitions between states over time and not from bird movement. survival ranged from 0.71 in the short state to 0.82 in the optimal state, with tall states being intermediate. we conclude that average florida scrub-jay survival will remain at levels that lead to continued population declines because most current habitat quality is only marginally suitable across most of the species range. improvements in habitat are likely to be slow and difficult because tall states are resistant to change and the optimal state represents an intermediate transitional stage. the multistate modeling approach to quantifying survival and habitat transition probabilities is useful for quantifying habitat transition probabilities and comparing them to bird transition probabilities to test for habitat selection in dynamic environments."

higher food abundance reduces the catchability of cod (gadus morhua) to longlines on the faroe plateau,catchability; gadus morhua; food availability; individual growth; longlines,FISHERIES RESEARCH,STEINGRUND P;CLEMENTSEN DH;MOURITSEN R,"the cod fishery at the faroes has been managed since 1996 by an effort management system where it is assumed that there is a direct relationship between fishing mortality and fishing effort. we show that this relationship is weak. due to a factor five variation in the primary production on the faroe plateau, the annual growth rate of cod may vary by a factor of five. commercial catch-per-unit-effort data in combination with stock assessment estimates showed that there was a negative correlation between the annual growth rate of cod and their catchability with longlines, as well as with the total fishing mortality of cod on the faroe plateau. furthermore, mark-recapture experiments showed that longline-caught cod in comparison with trawl-caught cod had a lower condition factor, a lower stomach content of natural prey, and a higher content of longline baits. during the feeding season in september-december, longline-caught cod exhibited a larger displacement distance than trawl-caught cod. these results were largely confirmed by storage tag data. consequently, during low-productive periods, (i) the longline-dominated cod fishery at the faroes exerted fishing mortalities that by far exceeded safe biological limits, and (ii) longline catch-per-unit-effort series might overestimate stock size considerably.

reduced effective population size in an overexploited population of the nile crocodile (crocodylus niloticus),population decline; effective population size; overexploitation; genetic diversity; microsatellites; crocodylus niloticus,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,BISHOP JM;LESLIE AJ;BOURQUIN SL;O RYAN C,"unchecked exploitation of wildlife resources is one of the major factors influencing species persistence throughout the world today. a significant consequence of exploitation is the increasing rate at which genetic diversity is lost as populations decline. recent studies suggest that life history traits affecting population growth, particularly in long-lived species, may act to moderate the impact of population decline on genetic variation and lead to remnant populations that appear genetically diverse despite having passed through substantial demographic bottlenecks. in this study we show that the retention of genetic variation in a partially recovered population of nile crocodile is deceptive, as it masks the reality of a significant decline in the population's effective size (n-e). repeated episodes of unchecked hunting in the mid to late 20th century have today led to a five-fold decrease in the population's n-e. using current census data we estimate the contemporary n-e/n ratio as similar to 0.05 and, in light of quotas that permit the ongoing removal of adults, simulated the likely effects of genetic drift on extant levels of variation. results indicate that even if the current effective size is maintained, both allelic diversity and heterozygosity will decline. our findings have complex implications for long-lived species: an emphasis on the retention of genetic variation alone, whilst disregarding the effects of population decline on effective size, may ultimately obscure the continued decline and extinction of exploited populations.

camera trapping photographic rate as an index of density in forest ungulates,abundance estimation; camera traps; density estimation; duikers; eastern arc; index surveys; trap rate; udzungwa,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,ROVERO F;MARSHALL AR,"1. calibrating indices of animal abundance to true densities is critical in wildlife studies especially when direct density estimations are precluded by high costs, lack of required data or model parameters, elusiveness and rarity of target species. for studies deploying camera traps, the use of photographic rate (photographs per sampling time) as an index of abundance potentially applies to the majority of terrestrial mammals where individual recognition, and hence capture-recapture analysis, are unfeasible. the very few studies addressing this method have either been limited by lack of independence between trapping rates and density estimations, or because they combined different species, thus introducing potential bias in camera trap detection rates. this study uses a single model species from several sites to analyse calibration of trapping rates to independently derived estimations of density. the study also makes the first field test of the method by rowcliffe et al. (2008) for density derivation from camera trapping rates based on modelling animal-camera contacts. 2. we deployed camera traps along line transects at six sites in the udzungwa mountains of tanzania and correlated trapping rates of harvey's duiker cephalophus harveyi with densities estimated from counts made along the same transects. 3. we found a strong, linear relationship (r(2) = 0.90) between trapping rate and density. sampling precision analysis indicates that camera trapping rates reach satisfactory precision when trapping effort amounts to 250-300 camera days. density estimates using rowcliffe et al.'s (2008) gas model conversion are higher than from transect censuses; we discuss the possible reasons and stress the need for more field tests. 4. synthesis and applications. subject to rigorous and periodic calibration, and standardization of sampling procedures in time and over different sites, camera trapping rate is shown to be, in this study, a valid index of density in the target species. comparative data indicate that this may also apply to forest ungulates in general. the method has great potential for standardizing monitoring programmes and reducing the costs of wildlife surveys, especially in remote areas."
"evaluating the reintroduction potential of lahontan cutthroat trout in fallen leaf lake, california",NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,AL CHOKHACHY R;PEACOCK M;HEKI LG;THIEDE G,"we evaluated the potential for reintroducing lahontan cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi. a species listed under the endangered species act, into a lacustrine system where the biotic community has changed dramatically since the species' extirpation there. since 2002. 76,547 lahontan cutthroat trout have been reintroduced into fallen leaf lake, california; we used creel surveys. diet data, mark-recapture methods. bioenergetics modeling, and netting data across seasons to evaluate the habitat use, growth, and relative abundance of lahontan cutthroat trout and the abundance. diet. habitat use, and predation by nonnative species. sampling totals (n = 2) and survey observations (n = 3) indicate low survival and abundance of reintroduced fish and together with creel data indicate the importance of epilimnetic habitats across size-classes. despite substantial growth. lahontan cutthroat trout exhibited low condition factor values (average = 0.69). we found substantial predation pressure front a large population of lake trout salvelinus namaycush ((n) over cap = 8.799 fish: 95% confidence interval [ci] 4,990-16,530 fish): analysis of lake trout diets showed an increase in piscivory and in the percentage of stomachs containing lahontan cutthroat trout anchor tags with increasing predator size. overall. we estimated that lake trout consumed over 38% of reintroduced lahontan cutthroat trout (mean number consumed = 7,736 fish: 95% ci = 4,388-14,534 fish). with bioenergetics modeling, however. we estimated that lake trout consumed considerable amounts of salmonid biomass during this period (mean biomass = 3,137 kg: 95% cl = 1 779 5,993 kg), which greatly exceeded the biomass of lahontan cutthroat trout reintroduced in 2006. during the stratification period, there was little overlap in habitat use between lake trout and lahontan cutthroat trout, but overlap was high during the spring and autumn. we found moderate-sized populations of nonnative brown trout salmo trutta, kokanee o. nerka (lacustrine sockeye salmon), and rainbow trout o. mykiss. together, our results suggest that lahontan cutthroat trout have few refugia front direct and indirect negative interactions with normative species and that alternative approaches are needed."
a method for monitoring movements of small fishes in urban streams,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,FICKE AD;MYRICK CA,"the front range region of colorado is all ecological transition zone between the rocky mountains and the western great plains. changes to streams resulting front urban and agricultural land uses have contributed to the decline of many plains and transition zone fishes. the fragmentation of stream systems by darns, weirs, and diversions is among,, the most detrimental of these changes. these structures call inhibit fish spawning migrations. the search for sporadic resources, and recolonization of empty habitats. to assess the magnitude of the problem. there is a distinct need to determine whether existing instream structures are barriers to migration. a relatively simple method of doing so involves giving fish a unique mark and tracking their movements ill the vicinity of a suspected barrier. we individually marked fish (15 species; 2,724 individuals) with visual implant elastomer (vie) marks and tracked their movements across a grade control structure in spring creek in fort collins, colorado. results front a multistratum mark-recapture analysis showed that the grade control structure in spring creck prevented upstream movement by most fish. the approach we used identifies problematic instream structures that impede movements and present a potential stressor to fish assemblages in urban streams. the use of individual vie marks is one of the few methods that can provide accurate information oil the movements of small-bodied fishes in streams. but the commonly encountered design issues associated with this type of study must be considered."
subsampling photographic capture-recapture data of tigers (panthera tigris) to minimize closure violation and improve estimate precision: a case,capture probability; fidelity; immigration; pradel model; trap area; trap density,POPULATION ECOLOGY,HARIHAR A;PANDAV B;GOYAL SP,"most studies using photographic capture-recapture methodology estimate parameters of interest with ecological and sampling uncertainties. however, the effect of sampling effort on assumption violation and estimate precision has seldom been described using empirical data in studies estimating population size of tigers (panthera tigris tigris). in this study, we evaluate the influence of trap effort (trap area, mean cell area and trap density) on the assumption of geographic closure and their relationship with estimated capture probability. we do this by sub-sampling capture histories obtained for tigers from 30 trapping stations within the chilla range of rajaji national park, india. we assessed the importance of trapping effort on geographic closure by estimating fidelity ((f) over cap) and immigration (f) over cap under the pradel model. estimate precision (cv% [(n) over cap) was evaluated based on estimates of capture probability ((p) over cap). results of the pradel analysis suggested that larger trap area (ta) ensured geographic closure, while high trap densities (td) exhibited sex-specific heterogeneity in recapture probabilities p. simulation results suggested a significant positive correlation between estimates of ((p) over cap) and td. with increase in estimated capture probability, estimate precision (cv% [(n) over cap]) also improved sharply. comparison of prior studies towards optimizing sampling strategies is often compromised due to the difference in scale and methods of sampling. therefore, we -urge that subsampling within a dataset as illustrated in our study may prove to be an advantageous step towards standardizing photographic capture-recapture sampling methodology for management objectives."
"habitat differences affect life history tactics of a pulsed resource consumer, the edible dormouse (glis glis)",beech-mast; capture-recapture models; local survival; program mark; reproductive strategy,POPULATION ECOLOGY,BIEBER C;RUF T,"we studied flexibility of life history tactics, in terms of habitat-dependent survival and reproduction, in a pulsed resource consumer, the edible dormouse (glis glis). we compared capture-mark-recapture data from three subpopulations of dormice: one in a homogeneous beech forest (forest), and two in patches of woodland (grove/hedge), with more constant but less energy-rich food availability (e.g., fleshy fruits), over a period of 5 years. the general seasonal pattern of hibernation and reproduction was similar in all three subpopulations. juveniles were born in only 3 out of 5 years at all study sites, which was paralleled by the occurrence of strong seed production in beech. reproductive output (number of juveniles/female) was lower at the two sites with low seed tree abundance (grove: 1.3; hedge: 2.0) than in the forest (4.4). yearly survival probability of adults was significantly lower in the forest (0.57, ci = 0.42-0.70) than in the areas grove and hedge (0.83, ci = 0.70-0.91). despite their shortened lifespan, estimated lifetime reproductive success of females in the forest was higher (6.2 young) than in the areas grove/hedge (4.8 young). together, these data indicate that, in more constant habitats (grove/hedge), lower reproductive investment was associated with increased longevity. however, dormice apparently maximise lifetime reproductive success by a 'sit tight' strategy that synchronises reproduction with energy rich seed pulses in deciduous forests."
a bayesian mark-recapture model for multiple-recapture data in a catch-and-release fishery,NA,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,WHITLOCK R;MCALLISTER M,"this paper extends a state-space bayesian mark-recapture framework to multiple-recapture data to estimate fishery-specific capture and mortality rates and seasonal movement rates for fish in different length classes. the methodology is applied to tag recapture data for white sturgeon (acipenser transmontanus) collected in the recreational fishery and the canadian department of fisheries and ocean's test fishery at albion in the lower fraser river. significant differences were found between some estimated movement rates by season and length class, supporting the notion of there being marked differences in seasonal movement patterns between different life history stages of a. transmontanus in the lower fraser river. uncertainty in the tag reporting rate parameter, quantified using a recreational creel sampling program, is summarized by a prior distribution. the utility of recreational fishing effort as a model covariate in accounting for seasonal and spatial variation in recapture rates is addressed using bayesian model evaluation criteria. the data provide strong support in favour of models that include fishing effort as a covariate. the appropriate level of stratification for the recreational catchability parameter q is assessed using bayesian model evaluation criteria; models in which q is estimated by season and length class have the highest posterior probabilities."

postbranding survival of steller sea lion pups at lowrie island in southeast alaska,branding; eumetopias jubatus; mark-recapture; northern sea lion; pinnipeds; southeast alaska; survival,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,HASTINGS KK;GELATT TS;KING JC,"steller sea lion (eumetopias jubatus) pups (n = 366) were hot-branded at lowrie island, southeast alaska, usa, in june 2001 and 2002 for vital-rates studies. to assess potential mortality following branding, we estimated weekly survival to 12 weeks postbranding using mark-recapture models. survival estimates ranged from 0.984/week to 0.988/week, or 0.868 over the 12-week period; varied little with sex, year, and capture area; and were higher for larger than smaller male pups and unexpectedly lower for larger than smaller female pups. inclusion of resights at 1-3 years of age prevented a 24.5% bias in cumulative survival to 12 weeks postbranding by accounting for pups that survived but permanently emigrated from lowrie island during the 12-week survey. data from double-marked pups (i.e., branded and flipper-tagged) indicated the low brand-misreading probability of 3.1% did not bias survival estimates. assuming survival differences between the first 2 weeks postbranding and later weeks were due entirely to the branding event, potential postbranding mortality of branded pups attributable to the branding event was 0.5-0.7%, or one pup for every 200 marked. weekly survival of branded pups was nearly identical to estimates from a control group of undisturbed, unbranded pups born to 10-11-year-old branded adult females in 2005 (0.987-0.988/week) and similar to pup survival estimates from other otariid studies. available data did not indicate substantial mortality to 12 weeks postbranding resulting from the branding disturbance, suggesting branding of steller sea lion pups can be used effectively for investigations of population declines without significantly affecting population health or study goals.

differential mortality drives life-history evolution and population dynamics in the fish brachyrhaphis rhabdophora,age-specific mortality hypothesis; brachyrhaphis rhabdophora; costa rica; elasticity analysis; live-bearer; poeciliidae; population growth rate; population matrix modeling; predation,ECOLOGY,JOHNSON JB;ZUNIGA VEGA JJ,"life-history theory predicts that populations experiencing different levels of extrinsic mortality will evolve divergent reproductive strategies. previous work in the live-bearing fish brachyrhaphis rhabdophora shows that individuals from populations that occur with piscivorous fish mature earlier and at smaller sizes and have more and smaller offspring than fish from populations without predators. however, until now, there have been no data to demonstrate that differences in mortality rates actually exist between predator and predator-free sites. here we present the results of a serial mark-recapture field study designed to estimate mortality rates in natural populations of b. rhabodophora from costa rica. we found that fish from predator environments experience higher overall mortality rates and proportionally higher adult mortality rates than fish from predator-free environments. we then ask what impact differences in mortality rates have on b. rhabdophora population dynamics. using a population matrix modeling approach, we found that b. rhabdophora that co-occur with predators have population growth rates similar to those without predators and both have confidence intervals that span lambda = 1.0. however, elasticity analysis revealed that the most important life-history stages for population growth in predator environments are found early in life and include growth through early ontogenetic stages and survival as small adults; in contrast, the most important life-history stages for population growth in predator-free environments occur late in life, including survival once large juvenile and adult stages are reached. hence, we demonstrate two important links between predation and population demography, one ecological due to the direct impacts of predator-induced mortality and the other expressed through predator-mediated reproductive adaptation."
unaccounted mortality in salmon fisheries: non-retention in gillnets and effects on estimates of spawners,delayed mortality; ecosystem engineers; fishery-induced injury; mark-recapture analysis; natural resource management; pacific salmon; population dynamics; stock-recruitment estimation,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,BAKER MR;SCHINDLER DE,"p> effective and sustainable natural resource management is enhanced when the consequences of exploitative practices are fully understood and acknowledged. commercial fisheries devote considerable resources to maximize the harvest of target species and minimize interference with non-target stocks. appropriately, bycatch and discard of non-target stocks are recognized as critical economic and conservation concerns. few studies, however, have examined non-retention mortality in target stocks. non-retention, where fish are engaged by fishing gear but not landed, is rarely quantified and the effects on stocks are unknown. mortality due to non-retention may have important effects on the dynamics of exploited populations. we surveyed spawning populations of sockeye salmon oncorhynchus nerka that had traversed commercial fisheries in bristol bay, alaska, to estimate the incidence of non-retention in gillnets and the severity of injuries associated with entanglement. to better understand how gillnet injury affects spawning success, we tagged and monitored stream-spawning fish and applied a maximum likelihood model to mark-recapture data. a substantial portion (11-29%) of spawning sockeye salmon exhibited clear signs of past entanglement with commercial gillnets. survival among such fish was significantly reduced. more than half of the fish that reach natal spawning grounds with fishery-related injuries fail to reproduce. this suggests that estimates of spawning stocks are inflated by 5-15% at minimum. synthesis and applications. our analyses indicate that non-retention in gillnet fisheries is an important and under-appreciated consequence of the exploitation of salmon. stock estimates for exploited populations that do not account for non-retention mortality overestimate the number of reproductively viable fish. unaccounted mortality and interannual variation in the magnitude of this mortality may prevent accurate estimates of viable spawners, confound our understanding of the relationship between stock size and recruitment, impede optimal management and obscure the ecosystem impacts of migratory stocks in coastal watersheds. given the magnitude of non-retention in this fishery, explicit consideration of non-retention mortality may be warranted across a wide range of exploited populations."
parental behaviour of a precocial species: implications for juvenile survival,brood movements; charadrius montanus; chick survival; detection probability; habitat selection; mountain plover; multi-strata; precocial species; shorebirds,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,DREITZ VJ,"p> parents determine habitat selection for precocial young by leading their young to foraging areas until the chicks attain full independence. there are potential benefits and costs to reproductive success associated with changing habitats while caring for young. this study investigated the relationship between different types of habitats and their quality on chick survival and brood movements of a declining upland shorebird, the mountain plover charadrius montanus. from 2004 to 2006, a total of 153 mountain plover broods were monitored on the primary breeding habitats in eastern colorado, usa; two shortgrass prairie habitats that were either occupied or unoccupied by black-tailed prairie dogs cynomys ludovicianus and agricultural lands. habitat quality hypotheses were tested using newly developed statistical applications to estimate survival of chicks and brood movement patterns. chick survival and brood movements were influenced by habitat. chick survival over the 30-day brood-rearing period was substantially higher on nesting habitat of shortgrass occupied by prairie dogs compared with agricultural land and shortgrass unoccupied by prairie dogs. the rate of brood movement away from shortgrass with prairie dogs was lower than shortgrass without prairie dogs, but higher than agricultural lands for each year of the study. this study suggests that complex processes influence how different habitats affect brood-rearing activity of mountain plovers. even though broods moved off nesting habitat of shortgrass occupied by prairie dogs, this habitat had the highest survival rate and is highly important to mountain plover reproductive success. synthesis and applications. in order to develop effective conservation strategies, the provision of adequate breeding habitat should include information on patterns of habitat selection for all stages of the breeding cycle, including the nesting and dependent young periods. from a conservation perspective, understanding the habitat use of young birds is critical when population dynamics show great sensitivity to survival of young. previous studies on mountain plovers have suggested that nest success is similar among shortgrass prairie habitats and agricultural lands. thus, conservation measures that increase nest success may be ineffective for mountain plovers unless they are accompanied by measures promoting chick survival."

nonlinear effects of winter sea ice on the survival probabilities of adelie penguins,age dependence; capture-mark-recapture; life history; population dynamics; southern oscillation index,OECOLOGIA,BALLERINI T;TAVECCHIA G;OLMASTRONI S;PEZZO F;FOCARDI S,"the population dynamics of antarctic seabirds are influenced by variations in winter sea ice extent and persistence; however, the type of relationship differs according to the region and the demographic parameter considered. we used annual presence/absence data obtained from 1,138 individually marked birds to study the influence of environmental and individual characteristics on the survival of ad,lie penguins pygoscelis adeliae at edmonson point (ross sea, antarctica) between 1994 and 2005. about 25% of 600 birds marked as chicks were reobserved at the natal colony. the capture and survival rates of ad,lie penguins at this colony increased with the age of individuals, and five age classes were identified for both parameters. mean adult survival was 0.85 (se = 0.01), and no effect of sex on survival was evident. breeding propensity, as measured by adult capture rates, was close to one, indicating a constant breeding effort through time. temporal variations in survival were best explained by a quadratic relationship with winter sea ice extent anomalies in the ross sea, suggesting that for this region optimal conditions are intermediate between too much and too little winter sea ice. this is likely the result of a balance between suitable wintering habitat and food availability. survival rates were not correlated with the southern oscillation index. low adult survival after a season characterized by severe environmental conditions at breeding but favorable conditions during winter suggested an additional mortality mediated by the reproductive effort. ad,lie penguins are sensitive indicators of environmental changes in the antarctic, and the results from this study provide insights into regional responses of this species to variability in winter sea ice habitat."
sin nombre virus and rodent species diversity: a test of the dilution and amplification hypotheses,NA,PLOS ONE,CLAY CA;LEHMER EM;JEOR SS;DEARING MD,"background: species diversity is proposed to greatly impact the prevalence of pathogens. two predominant hypotheses, the ""dilution effect'' and the ""amplification effect'', predict divergent outcomes with respect to the impact of species diversity. the dilution effect predicts that pathogen prevalence will be negatively correlated with increased species diversity, while the amplification effect predicts that pathogen prevalence will be positively correlated with diversity. for many host-pathogen systems, the relationship between diversity and pathogen prevalence has not be empirically examined. methodology/principal findings: we tested the dilution and amplification effect hypotheses by examining the prevalence of sin nombre virus (snv) with respect to diversity of the nocturnal rodent community. snv is directly transmitted primarily between deer mice (peromyscus maniculatus). using mark-recapture sampling in the spring and fall of 2003-2005, we measured snv prevalence in deer mice at 16 landscape level sites (3.1 hectares each) that varied in rodent species diversity. we explored several mechanisms by which species diversity may affect snv prevalence, including reduced host density, reduced host persistence, the presence of secondary reservoirs and community composition. we found a negative relationship between species diversity and snv prevalence in deer mice, thereby supporting the dilution effect hypothesis. deer mouse density and persistence were lower at sites with greater species diversity; however, only deer mouse persistence was positively correlated with snv prevalence. pinyon mice (p. truei) may serve as dilution agents, having a negative effect on prevalence, while kangaroo rats (dipodomys ordii), may have a positive effect on the prevalence of snv, perhaps through effects on deer mouse behavior. conclusions/significance: while previous studies on host-pathogen systems have found patterns of diversity consistent with either the dilution or amplification effects, the mechanisms by which species diversity influences prevalence have not been investigated. our study indicates that changes in host persistence, coupled with interspecific interactions, are important mechanisms through which diversity may influence patterns of pathogens. our results reveal the complexity of rodent community interactions with respect to snv dynamics."
cost-effective abundance estimation of rare animals: testing performance of small-boat surveys for killer whales in british columbia,abundance; cetacean; distance sampling; line transect; mark-recapture; model averaging; small-boat survey,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,WILLIAMS R;THOMAS L,"top predators are often rare, subject to anthropogenic mortality, and possess life-history traits that make them inherently vulnerable to extinction. iucn criteria recognise populations as critically endangered when abundance is <250 mature individuals, but estimating abundance of rare species can be more challenging than for common ones. cost-effective methods are needed to provide robust abundance estimates. in marine environments, small boats are more widely accessible than large ships for researchers conducting sightings surveys with limited funds, but studies are needed into efficacy of small-boat surveys. this study compares line transect and mark-recapture estimates from small-boat surveys in summer 2004 and 2005 for 'northern resident' killer whales in british columbia to true population size, known from censuses conducted by fisheries and oceans canada. the line transect estimate of 195 animals (95% ci 27-559) used model averaging to incorporate uncertainty in the detection function, while the mark-recapture estimate of 239 animals (ci 154-370) used a simple two-sample chapman estimator. both methods produced estimates close to the true population size, which numbered 219 animals in 2004 and 235 in 2006, but both suffered from the small sample sizes and violations of some model assumptions that will vex most pilot studies of rare species. initial abundance estimates from relatively low-cost surveys can be thought of as hypotheses to be tested as new data are collected. for species of conservation concern, any cost-effective attempt to estimate absolute abundance will assist status assessments, as long as estimates are presented with appropriate caveats.

patterns of mortality for each life-history stage in a population of the endangered new zealand stitchbird,mark-recapture; inbreeding; nest-box; translocation; temperature-dependent mortality,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,LOW M;PART T,"using data from 396 breeding attempts over an 8-year period, we investigated age- and stage-specific survival rates and their modifying factors in a closed island population of the new zealand stitchbird (or hihi, notiomystis cincta du bus). survival probability generally increased over time; however, at each life-history transition, survival in the new stage started lower than at the end of the previous stage, creating a 'saw-tooth' function of age-related survival. the probability of an egg hatching was low (0.73 +/- 0.01): most likely a consequence of genetic bottlenecks previously endured by this population. there was strong support for a positive relationship between hatching rate and the subsequent survival of the female parent, and hatching success declining for females > 4 years old. nestling survival probability increased as a function of brood size and days since hatching, and decreased relative to daily maximum ambient temperature and hatching date. support for models including ambient temperature was greater than for other covariates, with the majority of this temperature-mediated survival effect being restricted to the early nestling stage. fledglings had low survival rates in the first two weeks after leaving the nest, with post-fledging survival related to the fledgling's mass. two months after fledging, juvenile survival probability plateaued and remained relatively constant for the following autumn, winter and spring/summer breeding season. there was no effect of sex or season on adult survival probability. however, there was strong support for age-specific variation in adult survival, with survival likelihood increasing during the first four years before showing evidence of a senescence decline. within-stage survival increases were likely related to stage-specific selection pressures initially weeding out individuals of poorer phenotypes for the environment specific to each life-history stage. such a mechanism explains the initial high mortality at life-history transitions; a well-adapted phenotype for one stage may not necessarily be so well adapted for subsequent stages. these patterns are not only valuable for examining life-history theory, but also for understanding the regulation of vital rates in an endangered species and providing a basis from which better population management models and harvesting regimes can be derived."

application of a multistate model to estimate culvert effects on movement of small fishes,NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,NORMAN JR;HAGLER MM;FREEMAN MC;FREEMAN BJ,"while it is widely acknowledged that culverted road-stream crossings may impede fish passage, effects of culverts on movement of nongame and small-bodied fishes have not been extensively studied and studies generally have not accounted for spatial variation in capture probabilities. we estimated probabilities for upstream and downstream movement of small (30-120 rum standard length) benthic and water column fishes across stream reaches with and without culverts at four road-stream crossings over a 4-6-week period. movement and reach-specific capture probabilities were estimated using multistate capture-recapture models. although none of the culverts were complete barriers to passage, only a bottomless-box culvert appeared to permit unrestricted upstream and downstream movements by benthic fishes based on model estimates of movement probabilities. at two box culverts that were perched above the water surface at base flow, observed movements were limited to water column fishes and to intervals when runoff from storm events raised water levels above the perched level. only a single fish was observed to move through a partially embedded pipe culvert. estimates for probabilities of movement over distances equal to at least the length of one culvert were low (e.g., generally <= 0.03, estimated for 1-2-week intervals) and had wide 95% confidence intervals as a consequence of few observed movements to nonadjacent reaches. estimates of capture probabilities varied among reaches by a factor of 2 to over 10, illustrating the importance of accounting for spatially variable capture rates when estimating movement probabilities with capture-recapture data. longer-term studies are needed to evaluate temporal variability in stream fish passage at culverts (e.g., in relation to streamflow variability) and to thereby better quantify the degree of population fragmentation caused by road-stream crossings with culverts."

the numerical and functional responses of a granivorous rodent and the fate of neotropical tree seeds,belize; foraging behavior; heteromys desmarestianus; rodents; seed dispersal; seed fate; seed predation; small mammals; tropical forests,ECOLOGY,KLINGER R;REJMANEK M,"despite their potential to provide mechanistic explanations of rates of seed dispersal and seed fate, the functional and numerical responses of seed predators have never been explicitly examined within this context. therefore, we investigated the numerical response of a small-mammal seed predator, heteromys desmarestianus, to disturbance-induced changes in food availability and evaluated the degree to which removal and fate of seeds of eight tree species in a lowland tropical forest in belize were related to the functional response of h. desmarestianus to varying seed densities. mark-recapture trapping was used to estimate abundance of h. desmarestianus in six 0.5-ha grids from july 2000 to september 2002. fruit availability and seed fate were estimated in each grid, and two experiments nested within the grids were used to determine (1) the form of the functional response for nine levels of fruit density (2-32 fruits/m(2)), (2) the removal rate and handling times, and (3) the total proportion of fruits removed. the total proportion of fruits removed was determined primarily by the numerical response of h. desmarestianus to fruit availability, while removal rates and the proportion of seeds eaten or cached were related primarily to the form of the functional response. however, the numerical and functional responses interacted; h. desmarestianus showed strong spatial and temporal numerical responses to total fruit availability, and their density relative to fruit availability resulted in variation in the form of the functional response. types i, ii, and iii functional responses were observed, as were density-independent responses, and these responses varied both among and within fruit species. the highest proportions of fruits were eaten when the type iii functional response was detected, which was when fruit availability was high relative to h. desmarestianus population density. numerous idiosyncratic influences on seed fate have been documented, but our results indicate that shifts in the numerical and functional responses of seed predators to seasonal and interannual variation in seed availability potentially provide a general mechanistic explanation for patterns of removal and fate for vertebrate-dispersed seeds."
sex effects on life span and senescence in the wild when dates of birth and death are unknown,aging; black field cricket; capture-mark-recapture; gompertz; natural population; open population; sex differences; sexual dimorphism; teleogryllus commodus,ECOLOGY,ZAJITSCHEK F;BRASSIL CE;BONDURIANSKY R;BROOKS RC,"males and females allocate and schedule reproductive effort in very different ways. because the timing and amount of reproductive effort influence survival and thus the optimization of life histories, mortality and senescence are predicted to be sex specific. however, age-specific mortality rates of wild animals are often difficult to quantify in natural populations. studies that report mortality rates from natural populations are, therefore, almost entirely confined to long-lived, easy-to-track species such as large mammals and birds. here, we employ a novel approach using capture-mark-recapture data from a wild population of black field crickets (teleogryllus commodus) to test for sex differences in demographic aging. in this species, the age of captured adults cannot be readily determined, and animals cannot be reliably captured or observed every night, resulting in demographic data on individuals whose dates of birth and death are unknown. we implement a recently developed life-table analysis for wild-caught individuals of unknown age, in combination with a well-established capture-mark-recapture methodology that models probabilistic dates of death. this unified analytical framework makes it possible to test for aging in wild, hard-to-track animals. using these methods to fit gompertz models of age-specific mortality, we show that male crickets have higher mortality rates throughout life than female crickets. furthermore, males and females both exhibit increasing mortality rates with age, indicating senescence, but the rate of senescence is not sex specific. thus, observed sex differences in longevity are probably due to differences in baseline mortality rather than aging. our findings illustrate the complexity of the relationships between sex, background mortality, and senescence rate in wild populations, showing that the elevated mortality rate of males need not be coupled with an elevated rate of aging."
stable isotopes (delta d) delineate the origins and migratory connectivity of harvested animals: the case of european woodpigeons,deuterium; game-bird management; migratory connectivity; population structure; stable isotopes,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,HOBSON KA;LORMEE H;VAN WILGENBURG SL;WASSENAAR LI;BOUTIN JM,"quantifying connectivity between breeding, stopover, and wintering locations is critical to the management and conservation of migratory animals. mark-recapture approaches to establishing connectivity are limited due to marking location bias and poor recovery. alternatively, endogenous markers like stable isotopes can augment extrinsic markers and help to overcome their limitations. we used a stable hydrogen isotope (delta d) isoscape for europe and delta d analysis of feathers from harvested woodpigeons columba palumbus in france, the iberian peninsula, and corsica to estimate their natal origins. we propagated error associated with the relationship between deuterium in feathers (delta d(f)) and mean growing-season precipitation (delta d(p)) for woodpigeons in europe. for every delta d(f) value, we estimated a range of possible delta d(p) values and used this to map the probability of origin. we estimated that similar to 50% of the woodpigeon harvest in france was comprised of residents or from nearby countries to the east. about 30% of the take were medium-distance migrants, and about 10% were long-distance migrants from scandinavia, northwest russia and the baltic. a greater proportion of the long-distance migrants were taken in spain. in corsica, birds primarily originated from northern italy to the ukraine. the proportion of northern migrants harvested decreased with latitude, suggesting a leapfrog migration pattern. birds harvested at lower latitudes showed an inverse relationship between wing length and delta d(f), which suggested that longer-distance migrants had longer wings. synthesis and applications. this is the first application of stable isotope methodology to quantify population structure and migratory connectivity for a european game species. in addition, we used statistical approaches accounting for potential geospatial assignment errors. most of the french woodpigeons harvested are resident birds, which suggests that local management of the hunt in france may be most effective. however, southwestern france appeared to take a somewhat greater proportion of migrant woodpigeons, and thus, conservation and management of woodpigeons in france should recognize regional differences. our approach provided a methodological template that can be applied to questions of migratory connectivity for numerous species of game and non-game migrant birds."

tourism in protected areas can threaten wild populations: from individual response to population viability of the chough pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax,tourism disturbance; population viability analysis; individual-based-model; sensitivity of growth rate; biosphere reserve; ecological compensation; visitor access; recreation; ouessant island,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,KERBIRIOU C;LE VIOL I;ROBERT A;PORCHER E;GOURMELON F;JULLIARD R,"many protected areas are now faced with increasing pressure from visitors and tourism development. there is thus an urgent need for conservation biologists to evaluate the full impact of human disturbance not only on individual responses, but also on the viability of protected populations, so that relevant management measures can be proposed. we studied the impact of tourism on the rare and endangered chough pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax on a protected french island to assess the relationship between visitor pressure, bird individual behaviour and fitness, and population viability. during 8 years, we monitored foraging behaviour and estimated monthly juvenile survival using mark-recapture data. population viability was examined under different tourism scenarios, using a stochastic individual-based model that incorporated the impact of visitor numbers on juvenile survival. in summer, the foraging probability of choughs was negatively correlated with the number of visitors. as a result, the time allocated to foraging during peak tourist season, adjusted to day length and prey availability, was 50% lower than expected. juvenile survival rates were lowest in august, the peak tourist season, and varied significantly across years. august survival rate and therefore annual survival were negatively correlated with the number of visitors on the island in august and, except for a minor negative effect of rainfall, were not influenced by other environmental variables. stochastic simulations predicted a low probability of extinction of the protected population if the number of visitors remains constant in the future. however, short-term viability would be dramatically reduced if the current rate of increase in visitor numbers is maintained. synthesis and applications. we show that a relatively minor human-induced disturbance (e.g. scaring individuals away) has dramatic effects on population viability in a protected area, even when breeding individuals are not directly affected. this suggests that the full impact of tourism in protected areas may be overlooked, and has direct consequences for the assessment of sustainable levels of human disturbance and the design of quantitative management options compatible with tourist activities in protected areas. we specifically emphasize the need for more integrative approaches combining research at individual and population levels."
the fall migration flyways of monarch butterflies in eastern north america revealed by citizen scientists,monarch butterfly; danaus plexippus; migration; roosts; citizen science,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,HOWARD E;DAVIS AK,"the migration of monarch butterflies (danaus plexippus) from canada and the united states to overwintering sites in mexico is one of the world's most amazing biological phenomena, although recent threats make it imperative that the resources needed by migrating monarchs be conserved. the most important first step in preserving migration resources-determining the migration flyways-is also the most challenging because of the large-scale nature of the migration. prior attempts to determine the flyways using mark-recapture techniques with wing tags gave some clues, but this important information has never been fully obtainable until now. in 2005 the citizen-science program, journey north, initiated a project that asked participants to record sightings of overnight roosts of monarchs during their fall migration, and this project now provides an ideal way to illustrate the flyways used by monarchs on their way to mexico, with the assumption that roost locations indicate migration routes. we used 3 years of this data to elucidate the flyways on a continent-wide scale, that revealed two distinct flyways, but only one appears to lead directly to mexico. this main, 'central' flyway begins in the american midwest states and southern ontario, then continues south-southwest through the states of kansas, missouri, oklahoma and arkansas, and finally passes through texas and northern mexico. these data also highlighted a separate, smaller flyway along the eastern and coastal states, but there was a noticeable lack of roost sightings in this flyway at lower latitudes. since there are few recoveries of marked monarchs in mexico originating from coastal areas, we compared the timing of roost formation in this 'eastern' flyway with the main, central flyway. roosts in the eastern flyway lagged behind the central roosts in timing, suggesting that monarchs traveling in this flyway have a reduced chance of making it to the mexico wintering site. combined, our evidence indicates that locations in the central flyway should be considered priority areas for conserving migration resources."

species richness and occupancy estimation in communities subject to temporary emigration,biodiversity; butterfly survey; community; hierarchical bayes; monitoring; multistate model; occupancy; robust design; species richness; state-space model; temporary emigration; unobservable state,ECOLOGY,KERY M;ROYLE JA;PLATTNER M;DORAZIO RM,"species richness is the most common biodiversity metric, although typically some species remain unobserved. therefore, estimates of species richness and related quantities should account for imperfect detectability. community dynamics can often be represented as superposition of species-specific phenologies (e. g., in taxa with well-defined flight [insects], activity [rodents], or vegetation periods [plants]). we develop a model for such predictably open communities wherein species richness is expressed as the sum over observed and unobserved species of estimated species-specific and site-specific occurrence indicators and where seasonal occurrence is modeled as a species-specific function of time. our model is a multispecies extension of a multistate model with one unobservable state and represents a parsimonious way of dealing with a widespread form of ""temporary emigration.'' for illustration we use swiss butterfly monitoring data collected under a robust design (rd); species were recorded on 13 transects during two secondary periods within <= 7 primary sampling periods. we compare estimates with those under a variation of the model applied to standard data, where secondary samples are pooled. the latter model yielded unrealistically high estimates of total community size of 274 species. in contrast, estimates were similar under models applied to rd data with constant (122) or seasonally varying (126) detectability for each species, but the former was more parsimonious and therefore used for inference. per transect, 6 44 (mean 21.1) species were detected. species richness estimates averaged 29.3; therefore only 71% (range 32-92%) of all species present were ever detected. in any primary period, 0.4-5.6 species present were overlooked. detectability varied by species and averaged 0.88 per primary sampling period. our modeling framework is extremely flexible; extensions such as covariates for the occurrence or detectability of individual species are easy. it should be useful for communities with a predictable form of temporary emigration where rigorous estimation of community metrics has proved challenging so far."
"effect of current reproduction on apparent survival, breeding dispersal, and future reproduction in barn swallows assessed by multistate capture-recapture models",bias; capture-recapture; hirundo rustica; spatial scale; true survival,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,SCHAUB M;VON HIRSCHHEYDT J,"theoretical models predict a negative effect of current reproduction on breeding dispersal, survival and future reproduction, and many studies confirm these predictions. yet, results of most previous studies may be difficult to interpret because the fate of the affected individuals cannot always be observed. detection is almost always imperfect and some individuals emigrate from the study area, resulting in biased estimates of both survival and dispersal. most studies bypass these problems with strong assumptions. we use a multistate capture-recapture model that does not require these assumptions. states are defined based on classes of reproductive success and on observed dispersal events within the study area. by accounting for imperfect detection within the study area, the model allows estimation of the effect of reproductive success on apparent survival, dispersal probabilities within the study area and the annual transition probabilities among classes of reproductive success. based on an assumption about the estimate of real survival, the model allows the estimation of total dispersal that is not specific to a fixed study area. we applied this model to capture-recapture data of 2262 adult barn swallows (hirundo rustica) sampled from 1997-2004 in eight local populations in switzerland. we found that dispersal within the study area decreased with increasing reproductive success in both sexes, that reproductive success was not affected by preceding dispersal and that apparent survival of females but not of males increased with increasing reproductive success. apparent survival of females with high reproductive success was identical to apparent survival of males suggesting that this estimate of apparent survival (0.48) was close to true survival. total breeding dispersal was generally higher in females and it increased with decreasing reproductive success in both sexes. current reproductive success depended on reproductive success in the preceding year suggesting that individual differences were of importance. our study highlights that reproductive success was an important factor affecting breeding dispersal and population turnover. while unsuccessful males mainly remained in the local populations, many unsuccessful females left them. population turnover of adult swallows was mainly due to unsuccessful females."
the magnitude and selectivity of natural and multiple anthropogenic mortality causes in hunted brown bears,carnivore; compensatory mortality; competing risks; m-surge; wildlife management,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,BISCHOF R;SWENSON JE;YOCCOZ NG;MYSTERUD A;GIMENEZ O,"the population dynamic and evolutionary effects of harvesting are receiving growing attention among biologists. cause-specific estimates of mortality are necessary to determine and compare the magnitude and selectivity of hunting and other types of mortalities. in addition to the logistic and financial constraints on longitudinal studies, they are complicated by the fact that nonhunting mortality in managed populations usually consists of a mix of natural and human-caused factors. we used multistate capture-recapture (mcr) models to estimate cause-specific survival of brown bears (ursus arctos) in two subpopulations in sweden over a 23-year period. in our analysis, we distinguished between legal hunting and other sources of mortality, such as intraspecific predation, accidents, poaching, and damage control removals. we also tested whether a strong increase in harvest quotas after 1997 in one of the subpopulations affected vulnerability to legal hunting. although only a fraction of mortalities other than legal hunting could be considered natural, this group of causes showed a general pattern of demographic selectivity expected from natural mortality regimes in populations of long-lived species, namely greater vulnerability of young animals. on the other hand, demographic effects on hunting vulnerability were weak and inconsistent. our findings support the assumption that hunting and other mortalities were additive. as expected, an increase in hunting pressure coincided with a correspondingly large increase in vulnerability to hunting in the affected subpopulation. because even unbiased harvest can lead to selective pressures on life-history traits, such as size at primiparity, increasing harvest quotas may not only affect population growth directly, but could also alter optimal life-history strategies in brown bears and other carnivores. legal hunting is the most conveniently assessed and the most easily managed cause of mortality in many wild populations of large mammals. although legal hunting is the single-most important cause of mortality for brown bears in sweden, the combined mortality from other causes is of considerable magnitude and additionally shows greater selectivity in terms of sex and age than legal hunting. therefore, its role in population dynamics and evolution should not be underestimated."

multistate capture-recapture analysis under imperfect state observation: an application to disease models,capture-recapture; disease model; misclassification; multievent model; multistate model; transition probability; unobservable states,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,CONN PB;COOCH EG,"multistate capture-recapture models are frequently used to estimate the survival and state transition parameters needed to parameterize stage-structured population models, tools that are important for conservation and management. typically, such models assume that all encountered individuals can be assigned to a particular state without error or ambiguity, a requirement which is difficult to meet in practice. model extensions to relax this assumption would increase the richness of ecological data sets available for estimating life-history and stage-transition parameters with multistate models. one relatively common analytical approach when confronted with ambiguity in state determination is to censor all encounters where the state of an animal cannot be ascertained. here, we present an alternative approach, which uses a hidden markov (or multievent) modelling framework that can incorporate data from encounters of unknown state. using simulation, we show that our approach leads to estimators of state-specific survival and transition probabilities that are more precise, and sometimes considerably so, than methods based on censoring. we demonstrate our approach using field data from a study of the dynamics of conjunctivitis in the house finch carpodacus mexicanus muller. a fundamental challenge in modelling disease dynamics involves the estimation of the rates of entry and exit from one or more disease states, which can be complicated when disease state is uncertain. we show that incorporating data from unknown states made substantial improvements to parameter precision. synthesis and applications. missing or incomplete records are an unfortunate but common feature of many ecological field studies, often diminishing the quality and quantity of data. our approach of treating state as a hidden markov process allows such records to be used, increasing the precision of survival and state transition parameters in multistate mark-recapture studies. our approach is more general than other approaches in the literature, and does not require specialized sampling designs or ancillary information to inform state assignment. we suggest that ecologists consider using this modelling approach instead of censoring records whenever state information is missing."
evaluating methods for counting cryptic carnivores,camera-trapping; density estimation; kwazulu-natal; leopard; panthera pardus; track counts,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,BALME GA;HUNTER LTB;SLOTOW R,"numerous techniques have been proposed to estimate carnivore abundance and density, but few have been validated against populations of known size. we used a density estimate established by intensive monitoring of a population of radiotagged leopards (panthera pardus) with a detection probability of 1.0 to evaluate efficacy of track counts and camera-trap surveys as population estimators. we calculated densities from track counts using 2 methods and compared performance of 10 methods for calculating the effectively sampled area for camera-trapping data. compared to our reference density (7.33 +/- 60.44 leopards/100 km(2)), camera-trapping generally produced more accurate but less precise estimates than did track counts. the most accurate result (6.97 +/- 61.88 leopards/ 100 km(2)) came from camera-trap data with a sampled area buffered by a boundary strip representing the mean maximum distance moved by leopards outside the survey area (mmdmosa) established by telemetry. however, contrary to recent suggestions, the traditional method of using half the mean maximum distance moved from photographic recaptures did not result in gross overestimates of population density (6.56 +/- 61.92 leopards/100 km(2)) but rather displayed the next best performance after mmdmosa. the only track-count method comparable to reference density employed a capture-recapture framework applied to data when individuals were identified from their tracks (6.45 +/- 61.43 leopards/ 100 km(2)) but the underlying assumptions of this technique limit more widespread application. our results demonstrate that if applied correctly, camera-trap surveys represent the best balance of rigor and cost-effectiveness for estimating abundance and density of cryptic carnivore species that can be identified individually.

capture efficiency and size selectivity of channel catfish and blue catfish sampling gears,NA,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,BUCKMEIER DL;SCHLECHTE JW,"we used proportional recapture data from mark recapture experiments to directly estimate capture efficiency (percentage of fish captured per standard level of effort) and size selectivity (for 50-mm size-groups) of catfish sampling gears. hoop-net series were evaluated for collecting channel catfish ictalurus punctatus, and low-frequency, pulsed dc electrofishing was evaluated for collecting blue catfish i. furcatus. to examine spatial and temporal variability, capture efficiency and size selectivity were estimated in river and reservoir habitats during june, july, and september 2005. selectivity of experimental gill nets was also assessed. capture efficiency of hoop nets for channel catfish was consistent across months and between river and reservoir habitats (2.7-14.3% per 12 hoop-net series). capture efficiency of low-frequency electrofishing was low (frequently, <= 1% per 120 min) and variable; recapture rates were greatest in river habitat during july and september. hoop-net series collected representative samples of channel catfish between 250 and 556 min total length. likewise, blue catfish between 250 and 855 mm were fully vulnerable to low-frequency electrofishing. although fish smaller than 250 min were captured, they were frequently underrepresented in the catch of both gears. size selectivity was not affected by habitat or month sampled for either gear type or either species. capture efficiency of experimental gill nets was very low for both channel catfish and blue catfish (about 0.2% in 46 gill-net nights), and gill nets were more size selective than other gears. based oil our findings, hoop-net series and low-frequency electrofishing provide accurate size structure data for adult channel catfish and blue catfish, respectively, from both river and reservoir habitat types. hoop-net series also provide consistent estimates of channel catfish relative abundance; however. relative abundance data for blue catfish collected with low-frequency electrofishing should be used with caution due to observed variability in capture efficiency."
survival of female common eiders somateria m. mollissima in a declining population of the northern baltic sea,adult female apparent survival; mark-recapture; north atlantic oscillation; common eider; baltic sea,OECOLOGIA,HARIO M;MAZEROLLE MJ;SAUROLA P,"in long-lived species, adult survival is the population parameter having the highest elasticity, and therefore, it can be expected to be least affected by climatic variations. we studied the dynamics and survival of breeding female common eiders somateria mollissima mollissima in the baltic sea from 1960 to 2007. using nest censuses and capture-recapture methods, we investigated: (1) the annual apparent survival (phi) of breeding females, (2) the survival-mediated population fluctuation, (3) weather effects on survival, and (4) long-term population trends. based on capture histories of 6,393 females, average phi was 0.882 (95% confidence interval 0.864, 0.899). we found no relationship between population growth rate and survival. furthermore, the highest ranking models, based on akaike's information criterion, indicated no effect of the north atlantic oscillation index on the phi of eider females. population size, assessed from nest counts, has been steadily declining since 1985. despite the long time series (48 years), the overall variation in the phi rates remained comparatively narrow, at maximum ranging only 10% between 2 consecutive years. results imply that declining female survival is not the driving force behind the population decline, and we hypothesize that the overall poor fledging success and the consequent low recruitment explain the decreasing trend of nest densities since 1985."
estimating number of families for an urban fox population by using two public data sets,double-observation method; government data; road kill; vulpes vulpes,POPULATION ECOLOGY,URAGUCHI K;YAMAMURA K;SAITOH T,"the number of families in the urban fox population of sapporo, japan, was estimated from two sets of data reported by the public to government: records of road-killed foxes (information-a) and records of complaints about foxes (information-b). we assumed that fox populations consist of families that have exclusive home ranges, i.e., territories, during the period between gestation and dispersal. the urban area was then divided into hexagons that correspond to the territories. the locations from the two sets of records during the territorial period were plotted on the map. the number of fox families for which information-a and/or b was reported was estimated by counting the number of hexagons that include the record. the total number of families was estimated by using a double-observation method. we adopted chapman's unbiased estimator which is based on the hypergeometric distribution that corresponds to the conditional likelihood. we demonstrated the possibility of estimating the abundance of animals from government data such as road kill and complaints if the animals have territories."
the use of camera traps for estimating tiger and leopard populations in the high altitude mountains of bhutan,bhutan; panthera tigris; panthera pardus; conflicts; capture-recapture,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,WANG SW;MACDONALD DW,"we used camera traps in combination with capture-recapture data analysis to provide the first reliable density estimates for tigers and leopards from the high altitude and rugged terrain in bhutan's jigme singye wangchuck national park. fifty days of camera trapping in each of five study zones collapsed into two trapping blocks, resulted in a sampling effort of 4050 trap days. camera trapping yielded 17 tiger photos (14 left flanked and 3 right flanked) and 48 leopard photos (25 left flanked and 23 right flanked). using photos of these left flank, the closed heterogeneous jackknife model m-h was the best fit for the capture history data. a capture probability ((p) over cap) of 0.04 was obtained for both tigers and leopards, thus generating population size (n) of 8 tigers (se = 2.12) and 16 leopards (se = 2.91) with densities of 0.52 tiger 100 km(-2) and 1.04 leopard 100 km(-2). photographic evidence indicated that tigers and leopards did not overlap in their spatial use of space. tigers preferred less disturbed areas located further away from settlements, while leopards appeared to be more resilient to disturbances in so far as they were found nearer to human settlements. camera trapping using a capture-recapture framework was an effective tool for assessing population sizes for tiger and leopard in low density areas such as bhutan.

strong philopatry derived from capture-recapture records does not lead to fine-scale genetic differentiation in lesser kestrels,genetic structure; gene flow; capture-recapture; conservation genetics; genetic diversity,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,ALCAIDE M;SERRANO D;TELLA JL;NEGRO JJ,"the integration of capture-recapture and molecular approaches can improve our understanding of the consequences of habitat fragmentation on population connectivity. here we employed microsatellites to test dispersal hypotheses derived from intense and long-term ringing programmes of the lesser kestrel falco naumanni in western europe. re-encounters of 1308 marked individuals in spain have revealed that most first-time breeders settled within 10 km from their natal colony, with a negative association between dispersal and geographical distance. although these findings would predict fine-scale spatial patterns of genetic differentiation, the genetic impact of rarely reported events concerning long-distance effective dispersal (> 100 km) is unknown. first, we investigated a spatially structured and geographically isolated population located in north-eastern spain, where capture-recapture records and genetic data could be appropriately compared over similar spatial and temporal scales. spatial autocorrelation analyses (n = 174 nestlings from different broods) did not reveal either significant differences in average relatedness at any distance class nor decreased relatedness as a function of distance. at a broader spatial scale, bayesian analysis of population structure (n = 432 nestlings) indicated panmixia across western europe. however, f(st) comparisons between four geographically distinct populations indicated low but significant genetic differentiation. our genetic data would therefore challenge traditional assumptions associating philopatry with the emergence of fine-scale genetic structuring. this could be because even low levels of gene flow are enough to preclude the development of local genetic structure. nevertheless, the analysis of a geographically isolated and small population from southern france exemplifies a situation in which restricted dispersal has translated into weak but consistently significant genetic differentiation. relevant to conservation genetics and evolutionary biology, our results may lessen the genetic concerns derived from population fragmentation at relatively small geographical scales in species with apparently limited dispersal abilities, but raises concerns about increased genetic divergence in small and isolated demes."

species-specific barrier effects of a motorway on the habitat use of two threatened forest-living bat species,barbastella barbastellus; foraging area; habitat fragmentation; myotis bechsteinii; radio-telemetry; roost switching,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,KERTH G;MELBER M,"it is generally recognized that roads can adversely affect local animal populations but little is known how roads effect bats. in particular, no study compared the response of bats that differ in foraging ecology to motorways that cut through the breeding habitat. as bats are key species in conservation, such data are urgently needed for designing management plans. using radio-telemetry, mist netting, and mark-recapture data we investigated the effects of a motorway with heavy traffic on the habitat use of two threatened forest-living bats. we compared barbastelle bats (barbastella barbastellus), which forage in open space, to bechstein's bats (myods bechsteinii), which glean prey from the vegetation. five of six radiotracked barbastelle bats crossed the motorway during foraging and roost switching, flying through underpasses and directly over the motorway. in contrast, only three of 34 radiotracked bechstein's bats crossed the motorway during foraging, all three using an underpass. bechstein's bats, unlike barbastelle bats, never crossed the motorway during roost switching. moreover, only in bechstein's bats individuals foraging close to the motorway had smaller foraging areas than individuals foraging further away, whereas other forest edges had no such effect. our data show that motorways can restrict habitat accessibility for bats but the effect seems to depend on the species' foraging ecology and wing morphology. we suggest that motorways have stronger barrier effects on bats that forage close to surfaces than on bats that forage in open space, and discuss the implications of our findings for bat conservation during road construction.

black and white or shades of grey? detectability of adelie penguins during shipboard surveys in the antarctic pack-ice,antarctica; detectability; distance sampling; double observers; line transect; mark-recapture; point independence; population estimation; seabird; southern ocean,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,SOUTHWELL C;LOW M,"estimates of penguin abundance are important for developing marine ecosystem models and assessing potential competition between penguins and fisheries operations. most shipboard surveys of penguins use strip transect (st) or conventional distance sampling (cds) methods to estimate abundance, but the assumptions of these methods are largely untested. to test their validity for surveys of adelie penguins in the antarctic pack-ice, we recorded mark-recapture line-transect data and estimated detectability using a point-independence (pi) analysis. contrary to st assumptions, detectability declined markedly with distance from the transect line and varied with group size, substrate and observer position. estimated detection probabilities across a 300-m strip width, which has frequently been used in shipboard surveys, ranged from 0.09 for single penguins in water to 0.91 for groups of > 5 penguins on ice floes. contrary to cds assumptions, only two-thirds of detections close to the transect line by one observer team were detected by the second team. estimated detection probabilities on the transect line ranged from 0.30 for single penguins in water to 0.92 for large groups of penguins on ice. synthesis and applications. most shipboard surveys have not accounted for incomplete detection, potentially resulting in large negative biases that may vary between surveys. recent theoretical improvements provide the potential for these biases to be addressed, but this requires application of more sophisticated and rigorous survey protocols. application of pi analysis to mark-recapture line transect data demonstrated that substantial improvement to abundance estimates could be achieved for penguins compared with previously used methods. the protocols required for pi estimation can be applied to shipboard surveys of slow-moving species such as penguins and seals, but may be difficult to apply to species moving faster than the survey platform, such as flying seabirds. the benefits of multiple observers are maximized only if they operate independently. for multi-species surveys, it would be beneficial to have multiple teams of observers, each focussing on a species group. improved estimation of marine predator abundance will facilitate the development of more realistic ecosystem models and allow improved management of the impact of fisheries operations on non-target species."
estimating survival and movements using both live and dead recoveries: a case study of oystercatchers confronted with habitat change,coastal engineering; demography; emigration; haematopus ostralegus; habitat loss; multistate capture-recapture model; ringing data; winter severity; wintering waders,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,DURIEZ O;SAETHER SA;ENS BJ;CHOQUET R;PRADEL R;LAMBECK RHD;KLAASSEN M,"animals facing partial habitat loss can try to survive in the remaining habitat or emigrate. effects on survival and movements should be studied simultaneously since survival rates may be underestimated if emigrants are not considered, and since emigrants may experience reduced survival. we analysed movements and survival of adult wintering oystercatcher haematopus ostralegus in response to the 1986-1987 partial closure of the oosterschelde in the dutch delta. this reduced by one-third the tidal area of this major european wintering area for waders. we developed a novel variant of a multistate capture-recapture model allowing simultaneous estimation of survival and movement between sites using a mixture of data (live recaptures and dead recoveries). we used a two-step process, first estimating movements between sites followed by site-specific survival rates. most birds were faithful to their ringing site. winter survival was negatively affected by winter severity and was lowest among birds changing wintering site (i.e. moving outside of the oosterschelde). during mild winters, survival rates were very high, and similar to before the closure in both changed and unchanged sectors of the oosterschelde. however, the combined effect of habitat loss with severe winters decreased the survival of birds from changed sectors and induced emigration. the coastal engineering project coincided with three severe winters and high food stock, making assessment of its effects difficult. however, the habitat loss seems to have had less impact on adult survival and movements than did winter severity. synthesis and applications. human-induced habitat change may result in population decline through costly emigration or reduced survival or reproduction of individuals that stay. long-term monitoring of marked individuals helps to understand how populations respond to environmental change, but site-specific survival and movement rates should be integrated in the same model in order to maximize the information yield. our modelling approach facilitates this because it allows the inclusion of recoveries from outside the study area."

modeling misidentification errors in capture-recapture studies using photographic identification of evolving marks,capture-recapture; closed-population models; evolving tags; misidentification; natural tags; photographic identification; population size estimate,ECOLOGY,YOSHIZAKI J;POLLOCK KH;BROWNIE C;WEBSTER RA,"misidentification of animals is potentially important when naturally existing features (natural tags) are used to identify individual animals in a capture-recapture study. photographic identification (photoid) typically uses photographic images of animals' naturally existing features as tags (photographic tags) and is subject to two main causes of identification errors: those related to quality of photographs (non-evolving natural tags) and those related to changes in natural marks (evolving natural tags). the conventional methods for analysis of capture-recapture data do not account for identification errors, and to do so requires a detailed understanding of the misidentification mechanism. focusing on the situation where errors are due to evolving natural tags, we propose a misidentification mechanism and outline a framework for modeling the effect of misidentification in closed population studies. we introduce methods for estimating population size based on this model. using a simulation study, we show that conventional estimators can seriously overestimate population size when errors due to misidentification are ignored, and that, in comparison, our new estimators have better properties except in cases with low capture probabilities (< 0.2) or low misidentification rates (< 2.5%)."
direct and indirect estimates of black crappie size selectivity to a common sampling gear: potential biases and limitations for assessment,size selectivity; catchability; otter trawls; black crappie; direct/indirect measures of gear selectivity,FISHERIES RESEARCH,BINION GR;ALLEN MS;CATALANO MJ;PINE WE,"reliable stock assessments require estimates of gear selectivity to separate selection from true changes in population structure, but true measures of selectivity are rare in the literature. we estimated size selectivity of bottom trawl sampling for black crappie pomoxis nigromaculatus using capture-recapture methods to directly measure the effects of fish size on catchability, (q, the fraction of a fish stock collected with a given unit of fishing effort) at lake jeffords, florida, usa. additional indirect estimates of selectivity were obtained with a population model applied to long-term data at four florida lakes. direct measures of selectivity indicated catchability was highest for the 90-119 mm length-group and lowest for fish greater than or equal to 180 mm, with q declining by a factor of 2 or 3 for large fish relative to small fish. the indirect age-structured modeling approach revealed dome-shaped gear selectivity patterns with relative selectivities peaking at age-1 for three of four lakes. overall model trends indicated greater selectivity of younger fish (age-0 and age-1) to the gear followed by decreasing relative selectivity to older age-classes (age-2+). trawl selectivity patterns suggested that otter trawls would be best for monitoring the abundance of small black crappie and useful for indices of recruitment. our results showed that adult black crappie were underrepresented in bottom trawl samples which would influence age structure and growth rate estimates and the effectiveness of this gear as an assessment tool for tracking adult black crappie populations.

"effects of fish size, habitat, flow, and density on capture probabilities of age-0 rainbow trout estimated from electrofishing at discrete sites in a large river",NA,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,KORMAN J;YARD M;WALTERS C;COGGINS LG,"we estimated size-specific capture probabilities of age-0 rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss in the lee's ferry reach of the colorado river, arizona, by backpack and boat electrofishing at discrete shoreline sites using both depletion and mark-recapture experiments. our objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of estimating capture probability for juvenile fish in larger rivers: to determine how it is influenced by fish size, habitat, flow. density, and recovery period: and to test population closure assumptions. there was no mortality among the 35 1 rainbow trout that were captured by electrofishing, marked. and held for 24 h. of a total of 2,966 fish that were marked and released, only 0.61% were captured outside of mark-recapture sites, and total emigration front mark-recapture sites was 2.2-2.6%. these data strongly suggest that populations within discrete sites can be treated as effectively closed for the 24-h period between marking and recapture. eighty percent of capture probability estimates from 66 depletion experiments and 42 mark-recapture experiments ranged from 0.28 to 0.75 and from 0.17 to 0.45, respectively, and the average coefficient of variation of estimates was 0.26. there was strong support for a fish size-capture probability relationship that accounted for the differences in vulnerability across habitat types. smaller fish were less vulnerable in high-angle shorelines that were sampled by boat electrofishing. there was little support for capture probability models that accounted for within-day and across-month variation in flow. the effects of fish density on capture probability were challenging to discern, variable among habitat types and estimation methodologies, and confounded with the effect of fish size. as capture probability estimates were generally precise and the closure assumption was met, our results demonstrate that electrofishing-based mark-recapture experiments at discrete sites can be used to estimate the abundance of juvenile fish in large rivers."
effect of experimental manipulation on survival and recruitment of feral pigs,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,HANSON LB;MITCHELL MS;GRAND JB;JOLLEY DB;SPARKLIN BD;DITCHKOFF SS,"lethal removal is commonly used to reduce the density of invasive-species populations, presuming it reduces population growth rate; the actual effect of lethal removal on the vital rates contributing to population growth, however, is rarely tested. we implemented a manipulative experiment of feral pig (sus scrofa) populations at fort benning, georgia, usa, to assess the demographic effects of harvest intensity. using mark-recapture data, we estimated annual survival, recruitment, and population growth rates of populations in a moderately harvested area and a heavily harvested area for 2004-06. population growth rates did not differ between the populations. the top-ranked model for survival included a harvest intensity effect; model-averaged survival was lower for the heavily harvested population than for the moderately harvested population. increased immigration and reproduction likely compensated for the increased mortality in the heavily harvested population. we conclude that compensatory responses in feral pig recruitment can limit the success of lethal control efforts."
estimating the density of free-ranging wild horses in rugged gorges using a photographic mark-recapture technique,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,VERNES K;FREEMAN M;NESBITT B,"estimating the density of large, feral species such as wild horses at landscape scales can present a logistical hurdle for wildlife managers attempting to set density-based management targets. we undertook aerial surveys of wild horses by using a helicopter in guy fawkes river national park in north-eastern new south wales across 3 years to determine whether meaningful density estimates could be obtained efficiently by a mark-recapture technique based on recognition of individual horses. horse groups photographed from the air on the first of two surveys conducted each year were 'marked' on the basis of a unique combination of colours and natural markings, and 'recaptured' if they were photographed and identified on the second survey. population size was estimated with the program mark using a range of population estimators; however, because horses appeared to be evading detection on the second survey of each year, we chose a final estimation model that accounted for detection shyness in the study species. in 2005, the density estimate was 3.8 horses per km(2) (upper and lower 95% cl = 3.5-5.7 horses per km(2)). following horse control in these catchments, the estimate in 2007 was 2.3 horses per km(2) (upper and lower 95% cl = 2.1-3.4 horses per km(2)), and this change in density can be accounted for by the known number of horses removed from the survey area between survey periods. overall, the technique proved useful for estimating densities of wild horses in deeply dissected gorge country where other estimation techniques (such as line transects) are not practical; however, low recapture rates in one of the years of the study shows that the technique may not always be applicable. our technique should also be suitable for surveying other large mammals with broad ranges in open environments, provided recognition of individuals from unique marks is possible."
aerial baiting with 1080 to control wild dogs does not affect the populations of two common small mammal species,NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,FENNER S;KORTNER G;VERNES K,"more than most other animal control techniques, toxic baiting is fraught with the potential impact on non-target species. in the present study, we investigated the effect of aerial baiting with 1080 to control wild dogs in north-eastern new south wales (nsw), australia, on populations of southern bush rats (rattus fuscipes assimilis) and brown antechinus (antechinus stuartii), using a controlled experiment. six populations, three each within widely spaced baited and unbaited trapping grids, were monitored before and after bait laying. to develop capture-mark-recapture indices, separate 4-day trapping surveys were undertaken twice before and twice after meat baits (250 g containing 6 mg sodium fluoroacetate, 1080) were delivered from a helicopter at 40 baits per kilometre. to assess non-fatal bait consumption, all baits contained rhodamine b (rhb), which gets incorporated into the vibrissae of animals that have ingested this marker. neither mammal population decreased in size after baiting, nor was there any increase in population turnover rates or changes in the movement patterns of either species. furthermore, no trapped animal tested positive for rhb, suggesting that these small mammals rarely consume meat baits, and that, at the population level, the impact of baiting on them was likely negligible. it is therefore unlikely that the current practise of aerial baiting in nsw, although effective in reducing dog activity, threatens populations of these two common species and perhaps small mammals in general."
"field-based evaluation of scat dna methods to estimate population abundance of the spotted-tailed quoll (dasyurus maculatus), a rare australian marsupial",NA,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,RUIBAL M;PEAKALL R;CLARIDGE A;FIRESTONE K,"context. dna extracted non-invasively from remotely collected scat samples has been used successfully to enumerate populations of a few endangered mammal species. however, scat dna surveys relying on scent-marking behaviours need to identify if age-or sex-specific variations or seasonal changes in scat scent-marking patterns affect population estimates. furthermore, owing to the low quantity and quality of scat dna, a thorough assessment of the technique is needed when it is applied to different species to ensure that individual identification is reliable. aims. in the current study, microsatellite genetic profiles derived from 208 remotely collected scats of the spotted-tailed quoll (dasyurus maculatus), a rare australian marsupial carnivore, were compared with dna profiles from tissue of 22 live-trapped individuals from the same study area to critically assess the reliability of the non-invasive method to estimate population abundance. methods. scat samples were collected at scent-marking sites over 4 consecutive months (april-july 2005), 7 weeks of which overlapped with the trapping program to allow direct comparisons of population estimates. key results. combining a multiple-tubes approach with error checking analyses provided reliable genetic tags and resulted in the detection of the majority of the live- trapped population (18 of 22 individuals). ten additional individuals not known from trapping were also observed from scat dna. a longer-term sampling regime was required for scats than for trapping to allow direct detection of a large proportion of the population and to provide a comparable population estimate. critically, the 4-month scat collection period highlighted the importance of performing scat surveys during the mating season when scat scent marking is more frequent, and to avoid sex and age biases in scat marking patterns. implications. non-invasive scat dna sampling methods that rely on scent-marking behaviours need to consider the duration of the sampling period and temporal differences in behaviours by the sexes and age groups to ensure that meaningful population estimates are achieved."
