AB Conventional biomass dynamics models express next year's biomass as this year's biomass plus surplus production less catch. These models are typically applied to species with several age-classes but it is unclear how well they perform for short-lived species with low survival and high recruitment variation. Two alternative versions of the standard biomass dynamics model (Standard) were constructed for short-lived species by ignoring the 'old biomass' term(Annual), and assuming that the biomass at the start of the next year depends on density-dependent processes that are a function of that biomass (Stock-recruit). These models were fitted to catch and effort data for the grooved tiger prawn Penaeus semisulcatus using a hierarchical Bayesian technique. The results from the biomass dynamics models were compared with those from more complicated weekly delay-difference models. The analyses show that: the Standard model is flexible for short-lived species; the Stock-recruit model provides the most parsimonious fit; simple biomass dynamics models can provide virtually identical results to data-demanding models; and spatial variability in key population dynamics parameters exists for P. semisulcatus. The method outlined in this paper provides a means to conduct quantitative population assessments for data-limited short-lived species.

AB Knowledge of demographic parameters of most cetacean populations is scarce because of problems associated with sampling open populations of wide-ranging animals. In recent years, capture-recapture models have been developed to address these problems. We used a photo-identification dataset collected from a population of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus between 1999 and 2004 around 2 islands of the Azores archipelago, to demonstrate the use of some of these methods. A variety of open models and Pollock's robust design were applied to estimate population size, survival probability and emigration rates. Using only the estimates with the lowest coefficients of variation, the annual abundance of adult dolphins varied between 202 (95% CI: 148 to 277) and 334 (95% CI: 237 to 469), according to the Jolly-Seber method, and between 114 (95% CI: 85 to 152) and 288 (95% CI: 196 to 423), according to the robust design. The number of subadult individuals varied from 300 (95% CI: 232 to 387) to 434 (95% CL 316 to 597) based on the Jolly-Seber method. The open models yielded estimates of adult survival (0.970 +/- 0.029 SE) that were significantly higher than those for subadults (0.815 +/- 0.083 SE). Movement patterns of dolphins in the Azores seem to follow a Markovian model, in which dolphins seen in the study area in 1 yr show higher probability of emigrating in the following year. Despite some limitations, this is the first study to model transience and temporary emigration in a dolphin population.

AB Fish respond to habitat and demographic factors that affect growth and survival through migration, reproduction and mortality. However, the importance of migration rates on fish population dynamics and the effects of habitat and demographic factors on movement are not well understood. We used mark-recapture to determine population dynamics (recruitment, mortality, immigration and emigration) of the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus inhabiting semi-isolated ponds in a New Jersey salt marsh over the spring and summer of 2002. We tested the effects of marsh pond flood frequency, water temperature and fish density on mummichog emigration from marsh ponds. Results show that during the April to July study period, monthly emigration rates averaged 30% and tended to decline from spring to summer in most ponds. Recruitment and immigration were negligible after May and June, respectively. Increasing mortality and decreasing emigration and immigration over the study period suggested that there was a shift in the importance of movement in regulating mummichog population size in marsh ponds. The mean rate of emigration showed a significant negative relationship with the frequency of flooding in a pond. Neither mummichog density nor water temperature was strongly correlated with emigration rate. Our finding of lower emigration from ponds with higher flooding frequency suggests that frequent pond flooding indirectly triggers stationary behaviour in mummichogs because of enhanced water quality and food abundance.

AB Yellow tang Zebrasoma flavescens is the primary coral reef fish species taken in Hawaii for the aquarium trade. As part of an extensive adaptive management effort that included a network of marine protected areas that prohibited commercial aquarium fishing, an emphasis was placed on obtaining habitat- and sex-specific life history information for this valuable species. Using otolith and capture-mark-recapture methods we examined sexual differences in ontogenetic patterns of habitat use, growth rate, size dimorphism and longevity. Age validation using tetracycline to mark otoliths provided evidence that a single annulus formed each year. Yellow tang are a long-lived species (the oldest individual collected was 41 yr old) and display an asymptotic growth pattern typical of the family Acanthuridae. Median size and age at the transition between deeper coral-rich and shallow turf-dominated habitat use were about 20 mm longer and about 2 yr older for males than females and coincided with an increase in reproductive output.. The sexual difference in size at habitat transition, combined with sexual size dimorphism (mean asymptotic maximum length-male: 179 mm; female 156 mm) results in differences in the size distributions of both sexes in the 2 habitats. Sexual size dimorphism resulted from a higher growth rate for males through the juvenile period.

AB Heaviside's dolphins, Cephalorhynchus heavisidii, are endemic to southwestern Africa, where they are exposed to unknown levels of anthropogenic threats, including inshore set netting. Using photo-ID data collected over 3 yr on the west coast of South Africa, we calculated Chapman's-modified Petersen estimates of the number of distinctive individuals at three spatial scales. Sample sizes were small and recapture rates low resulting in high variance. Total population abundance was extrapolated from the proportion of well-marked animals in the population (14%-17%) with between-year estimates adjusted for mortality using data from Commerson's dolphin. The total population size was calculated as 527 animals (CV = 0.35, CI 272-1,020) in the 1999 study area (20 km of coastline, within season), 3,429 animals (CV = 0.36, CI 1,721-6,828) in the central study area (150 km of coastline, 3 yr), and 6,345 animals (CV = 0.26, CI 3,573-11,267) in the full study area (390 km of coastline, 2 yr). Dolphins fitted with satellite transmitters varied in their use of the inshore photographic study area from 39.5% to 94.7% of transmission days (38-51 total). Given the known or suspected biases in the data, these abundance estimates are likely to be biased downward.

AB Objectives: Several methods for estimating completeness in cancer registries have been proposed. Little is known about their relative merits. Before embarking on a systematic comparison of methods we wanted to know which indicators were currently in use and whether there had been comparative investigations of estimation methods.
   Methods: We performed a survey among European cancer registries asking which methods for estimating completeness they used and whether they had performed comparisons of methods.
   Results: One hundred and ninety-five European cancer registries were contacted after identification using membership directories of the European Network of Cancer Registries (ENCR) and of the International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR), Fifty-six (29%; 22%-36%) of the 195 cancer registries replied. Forty-eight (86%; 74%-94%) of these stated that they estimated completeness. Thirty-five (73%; 58%-85%) used historic comparisons, 31 (65%; 49%-78%) compared their data with a reference registry, 28 (58%; 143%-72%) registries used mortality incidence ratio. Capture-recapture methods were applied in only 12 (25%; 14%-40%) registries The flow method was used by ten (21%, 10%-35%) registries. There were regional differences in the use of methods. Comparisons of methods were rare and usually restricted to real data at hand. A systematic comparison including all indicators actually in use in cancer registries was not reported.
   Conclusions: A comparison of methods under well defined realistic conditions seems to be indicated. Unifying the methods for estimating completeness would improve validity of comparisons between cancer registries.

AB Mark-recapture methods were used to determine population abundance and life history of five grand (Oligosoma grande Scincidae) and two Otago (O. olagense) skink populations over 6 years at Macraes Flat, in southern New Zealand. The population ecology of declining and stable grand skink populations was contrasted and the life histories of grand and Otago skinks were compared. The life histories of both species were similar and characterised by slow maturity and longevity (3-5 and 4-6 years to produce first offspring and longevity Lip to 18 and 13.5 years in the wild; grand and Otago skinks respectively). With the exception of one grand skink population, all skink populations showed evidence of declines. Annual reproductive output (ARO) was estimated at 1.46 and 1.41 offspring per female per year (grand and Otago skinks respectively). These ARO values were markedly lower than those reported during a previous study at Macraes Flat during the same decade (2.17 and 2.34 respectively). The stable grand skink population excelled (relatively) in all life history traits measured: ARO of 1.66, 30% of newborns persisted 5+ years, adult survivorship averaged 0.84, and 36% of newborns were recruited to the adult population. In contrast, many of the declining populations were seriously deficient in one or more traits. This study raises concerns about the viability of small populations that have dropped below a critical size, beyond which one or multiple life history traits can act to further the decline. It is imperative that conservation managers of k-selected species move outside the 'improving adult survival' paradigm and begin to consider other potentially limiting population parameters.

AB The Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta (Copper-bellied Watersnake) population north of 40 degrees north latitude is categorized as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act. Previous efforts to use mark-recapture to estimate population size have been unsuccessful because there were so few initial captures. We therefore evaluated the status of the largest presumed subpopulation of this population by using strip transects to provide a conservative (maximum) estimate of density and population size of adults. Our results indicate that the largest presumed adult Copper-bellied Watersnake metapopulation north of 40 degrees north latitude is extremely small, with a total size of 94 22 adults, and is characterized by a population density of 1.17 +/- 0.27 adult snakes/ha (95 % CI = 0.73-1.87 snake/ha). This Copper-bellied Watersnake population appears to be in danger of extirpation within the foreseeable future. Recovery will require protecting existing wetland complexes and restoring wetlands and the surrounding upland habitats.

AB Rajaji National Park, which forms the northwestern limit of the range of the tiger Panthera tigris in India, is bisected into western and eastern sectors by development activities along the banks of the river Ganga. Following a voluntary pastoral Gujjar resettlement programme initiated in the Park by the Uttarakhand Forest Department, we assessed the status of the tiger and its prey. We used sign surveys for tigers, leopards Panthera pardus and their prey, estimated prey densities using line transects and distance sampling, and estimated the density of tigers using photographic capture-recapture analysis. Our results indicate that the use of the area by tigers differed significantly between the two sectors of the Park, with pug mark encounter rates per 250 m segment from sign surveys of 0.07 +/- SE 0.04 in the west and 1.6 +/- SE 0.3 in the east. Although the high estimated prey densities (> 80 km(-2)) in the Park have the potential to support high densities of tigers, we photo-captured only one tigress in the western sector and five adult tigers and two cubs in the east (the latter with a mean density of 5.12 +/- SE 0.7 per 100 km(2)). Whereas recovery of the tiger population in the eastern sector following the resettlement of Gujjars is evident, the lack of connectivity to source populations (Corbett Tiger Reserve and eastern Rajaji National Park) and increased anthropogenic pressures appear to have inhibited the recovery of tiger populations in the western sector. Restoration, therefore, of the Chilla-Motichur corridor to facilitate the dispersal of tigers from the eastern to the western sector of the Park is of critical importance.

AB To obtain information on density of tiger Panthera tigris in selectively logged forest, a 9-month camera-trapping survey was conducted over elevations of 190-850 in in lowland and hill/upper dipterocarp and lower montane forests in Gunung Basor Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. Capture-recapture sampling methods were used to estimate tiger population density in the Reserve. The number of individual tigers captured was six. Using the M-h jackknife estimator the average capture probability per sampling occasion was 0.28 and the corresponding estimate of population size 8 +/- SE 1.89. The overall probability of photo-capturing a tiger present in the sampled area was 0.75. Using an approach based on distances between photo-captures, a buffer width of 3.22 kin and an effectively sampled area of 308 kM(2) was estimated. This resulted in a density estimate of 2.59 +/- SE 0.71 adult tigers per 100 km(2). The results indicate that selectively logged forests such as Gunung Basor Forest Reserve have the potential to accommodate a high density of tigers. Decision makers and conservation planners should not therefore perceive selectively logged forests to have limited conservation value. Further research on the ecology of tigers and their prey in selectively logged forests is urgently needed. Such research would enable conservationists to recommend tiger-friendly management guidelines for sustainable forest management and thereby significantly contribute to tiger conservation in Malaysia.

AB Three species of mangrove crabs (Scylla spp.) were captured in live traps in Ngaremeduu Bay on the island of Babeldaob, Republic of Palau. Most were S. serrata, but one individual each of S. olivacea and S. paramamosain was also trapped, establishing existence of a biogeographic gradient in mangrove crab species diversity across the Micronesian archipelago. Species composition of mangrove trees along transects around the bay and along the three major tributaries was similar to that of other Micronesian islands, although trees are smaller in Palau. For 17 months in 1999-2000, crabs were trapped in the bay and captured by hand along the transects; they were trapped again for I month in 2004. Characteristics of the crabs and of burrows encountered along the transects suggested that only S. serrata was captured in 1999-2000 and that population density of this species was 40 crabs ha(-1). Carapace widths for the 159 crabs captured during the entire study did not differ significantly over the 4-yr span, and averaged 153 turn for males and 137 mm for females. However, average carapace widths for the largest quartile of crabs declined significantly from 174 mm to 171 mm across the study period. Catch per unit effort was 0.28 crab per trap night in 1999-2000 and 0.45 in 2004. Although large crabs are still available in Ngaremeduu Bay, current regulations may not be sufficient to keep populations from decreasing gradually in size, especially in the face of increasing harvest pressure on the island of Babeldaob.

AB Much of the research into the demography of butterflies conducted in Europe during the last few decades focused on rapidly declining or, on the other hand, expanding species, whereas species with stable trend tend to be neglected by researchers. Argynnis aglaja, a widely distributed inhabitant of semi-natural grasslands, represents a suitable model for studying patterns of landscape persistence of not-yet-threatened grassland insects. Using mark-recapture method conducted for one season on humid meadows in Western Bohemia, Czech Republic, we show that this large-bodied species is capable to form large and dense populations, reaching densities of over 250 individuals per hectare. The adults were relatively long-living, an average female longevity (11.8 d) was over twice as high as an average male longevity (4.6 d), with maxima being 22 (a male) and 30 (a female) days. The prolonged female lifespan is beneficial for a species that do not emerge with fully-matured eggs and oviposits singly over large areas. Modelling mobility, well-approximated by an inverse-power function, predicted that about one individual in a thousand would cross the distance of 1000 meters. We conclude that the satisfactory conservation status of A. aglaja stems from its capability to reach high local densities combined with a good dispersal power.

AB As part of a national strategy for recovering tiger populations, the Myanmar Government recently proposed its first and the world's largest tiger reserve in the Hukaung Valley, Kachin State. During November 2002-June 2004, camera-traps were used to record tigers, identify individuals, and, using capture-recapture approaches, estimate density in the reserve. Despite extensive (203 trap locations, 275-558 km(2) sample plots) and intensive (> 4,500 trap nights, 9 months of sampling) survey efforts, only 12 independent detections of six individual tigers were made across three study sites. Due to the sparse data, estimates of tiger abundance generated by Program CAPTURE could not be made for all survey sites. Other approaches to estimating density, based on numbers of tigers caught, or derived from borrowed estimates of detection probability, offer an alternative to capture-recapture analysis. Tiger densities fall in the range of 0.2-2.2 tigers/100 km(2), with 7-71 tigers inside a 3,250 km(2) area of prime tiger habitat, where efforts to protect tigers are currently focused. Tiger numbers might be stabilized if strict measures are taken to protect tigers and their prey from seasonal hunting and to suppress illegal trade in wildlife. Efforts to monitor abundance trends in the tiger population will be expensive given the difficulty with which tiger data can be obtained and the lack of available surrogate indices of tiger density. Monitoring occupancy patterns, the subject of a separate ongoing study, may be more efficient.

AB We initiated a mark-recapture study to determine the effects of shrub density on Anolis carolinensis (Green Anole) populations. Green Anole perch site, shrub species, and shrub volume preferences were also examined. We established two study plots of different shrub densities in open pine forests on the Angelina National Forest in eastern Texas In late spring, the Green Anole population at the higher shrub-density plot was estimated to be 16 times greater than the population at the lower shrub-density plot. Green Anoles most commonly perched on live shrubs, but exhibited very little preference or avoidance of any particular species of live shrub or shrub-level vine However, shrubs used by Green Anoles were 4-6 times greater in volume than plot averages.

AB A semiparametric method using a local polynomial is proposed to estimate the population size at a specific time from multiple lists of an open population. The asymptotic distribution for the proposed estimators is derived. Simulation studies show that the proposed procedure works much better than existing methods. In addition, we provide a simple and efficient method to deal with the variable selection problem in a log-linear model when the number of the lists is large. The method is applied to estimate the number of drug-abusers in Hong Kong over the period 1977-1997.

TI Effects of Fish Size, Habitat, Flow, and Density on Capture
   Probabilities of Age-0 Rainbow Trout Estimated from Electrofishing at

AB We estimated size-specific capture probabilities of age-0 rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Lee's Ferry Reach of the Colorado River, Arizona, by backpack and boat electrofishing at discrete shoreline sites using both depletion and mark-recapture experiments. Our objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of estimating capture probability for juvenile fish in larger rivers: to determine how it is influenced by fish size, habitat, flow. density, and recovery period: and to test population closure assumptions. There was no mortality among the 35 1 rainbow trout that were captured by electrofishing, marked. and held for 24 h. Of a total of 2,966 fish that were marked and released, only 0.61% were captured outside of mark-recapture sites, and total emigration front mark-recapture sites was 2.2-2.6%. These data strongly suggest that populations within discrete sites can be treated as effectively closed for the 24-h period between marking and recapture. Eighty percent of capture probability estimates from 66 depletion experiments and 42 mark-recapture experiments ranged from 0.28 to 0.75 and from 0.17 to 0.45, respectively, and the average coefficient of variation of estimates was 0.26. There was strong support for a fish size-capture probability relationship that accounted for the differences in vulnerability across habitat types. Smaller fish were less vulnerable in high-angle shorelines that were sampled by boat electrofishing. There was little support for capture probability models that accounted for within-day and across-month variation in flow. The effects of fish density on capture probability were challenging to discern, variable among habitat types and estimation methodologies, and confounded with the effect of fish size. As capture probability estimates were generally precise and the closure assumption was met, our results demonstrate that electrofishing-based mark-recapture experiments at discrete sites can be used to estimate the abundance of juvenile fish in large rivers.

AB Wildlife managers at Kenai Fjords (KEFJ) National Park, Alaska, are developing a comprehensive bear management plan. An important first step in this plan is to establish a baseline of bear abundance and inventory approaches for future monitoring efforts. In this Study We use non-invasive genetic sampling and DNA-based capture-mark-recapture (CMR) analysis to estimate abundance of American black bears (Ursus americanus) using coastal habitats in the park. We used 2 multi-session CMR models in program MARK and 2 continuous-occasion models specifically designed for DNA-based capture data in the programs CAPWIRE and BAYESN. The latter 2 models maximize data from non-invasive sampling by allowing the entire sampling period to be considered a single continuous capture-mark-recapture occasion. Although all models yielded similar point estimates of population size, confidence intervals varied widely among methods. CAPWIRE yielded the most precise estimates of bear abundance. The number of bears estimated in each KEFJ bay ranged from 73 in the least Populated to 324 in the most Populated bay. Overall, the continuous-occasion CMR models provided the best estimates with our dataset, and We found that this approach offers a practical option when trapping seasons are constrained by biological or logistical factors.

AB Although the Chinese government and international organizations have spent millions of dollars estimating the population size of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), the outcomes of such surveys have been debated because the methods used had uncertain ability to differentiate individuals. Our work in Wanglang Reserve was the first attempt at using fecal microsatellite analysis to enumerate giant pandas (Zhan et al. 2006), and we found the molecular enumeration for the reserve more than doubled that estimated in the third National Survey. Recently, Garshelis et al. (2008) challenged our DNA estimate on the grounds that our study lacked geographic closure and that genotyping errors confounded our results. We challenge both assertions. First, we realize the violation of the assumption of geographic closure is a common problem for noninvasive genetic capture-recapture studies; therefore, we tried in our methodology to minimize geographic closure effects. We conclude that immigration did not greatly affect our main conclusions because of a geographic barrier circling the study area, the limited mobility of giant pandas, and the same sampling intensity was applied to the whole study area. Second, internationally accepted standards were applied to our molecular analysis and appropriate laboratory procedures were taken to produce reliable genotypes. Although we did not report an estimate of genotyping error in our previous work (Zhan et al. 2006), genotyping error rates have now been estimated, but are still pending publication. Based on the Wanglang result, we raised the possibility that there might be more giant pandas in the wild than previously thought. If our prediction is shown to be correct, we do not believe the new estimate will serve to downgrade current endangered status of the giant panda, because population numbers remain very low and panda habitats are fragmented (even more so since the 2008 earthquake). For future conservation of giant pandas, we suggest more attention should be paid to panda habitat conservation, including habitat restoration at the landscape scale and scientific research on detailed population processes.

AB Lethal removal is commonly used to reduce the density of invasive-species populations, presuming it reduces population growth rate; the actual effect of lethal removal on the vital rates contributing to population growth, however, is rarely tested. We implemented a manipulative experiment of feral pig (Sus scrofa) populations at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA, to assess the demographic effects of harvest intensity. Using mark-recapture data, we estimated annual survival, recruitment, and population growth rates of populations in a moderately harvested area and a heavily harvested area for 2004-06. Population growth rates did not differ between the populations. The top-ranked model for survival included a harvest intensity effect; model-averaged survival was lower for the heavily harvested population than for the moderately harvested population. Increased immigration and reproduction likely compensated for the increased mortality in the heavily harvested population. We conclude that compensatory responses in feral pig recruitment can limit the success of lethal control efforts.

TI Estimating the density of free-ranging wild horses in rugged gorges
   using a photographic mark-recapture technique

AB Estimating the density of large, feral species such as wild horses at landscape scales can present a logistical hurdle for wildlife managers attempting to set density-based management targets. We undertook aerial surveys of wild horses by using a helicopter in Guy Fawkes River National Park in north-eastern New South Wales across 3 years to determine whether meaningful density estimates could be obtained efficiently by a mark-recapture technique based on recognition of individual horses. Horse groups photographed from the air on the first of two surveys conducted each year were 'marked' on the basis of a unique combination of colours and natural markings, and 'recaptured' if they were photographed and identified on the second survey. Population size was estimated with the program MARK using a range of population estimators; however, because horses appeared to be evading detection on the second survey of each year, we chose a final estimation model that accounted for detection shyness in the study species. In 2005, the density estimate was 3.8 horses per km(2) (upper and lower 95% CL = 3.5-5.7 horses per km(2)). Following horse control in these catchments, the estimate in 2007 was 2.3 horses per km(2) (upper and lower 95% CL = 2.1-3.4 horses per km(2)), and this change in density can be accounted for by the known number of horses removed from the survey area between survey periods. Overall, the technique proved useful for estimating densities of wild horses in deeply dissected gorge country where other estimation techniques (such as line transects) are not practical; however, low recapture rates in one of the years of the study shows that the technique may not always be applicable. Our technique should also be suitable for surveying other large mammals with broad ranges in open environments, provided recognition of individuals from unique marks is possible.

AB More than most other animal control techniques, toxic baiting is fraught with the potential impact on non-target species. In the present study, we investigated the effect of aerial baiting with 1080 to control wild dogs in north-eastern New South Wales (NSW), Australia, on populations of southern bush rats (Rattus fuscipes assimilis) and brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), using a controlled experiment. Six populations, three each within widely spaced baited and unbaited trapping grids, were monitored before and after bait laying. To develop capture-mark-recapture indices, separate 4-day trapping surveys were undertaken twice before and twice after meat baits (250 g containing 6 mg sodium fluoroacetate, 1080) were delivered from a helicopter at 40 baits per kilometre. To assess non-fatal bait consumption, all baits contained rhodamine B (RhB), which gets incorporated into the vibrissae of animals that have ingested this marker. Neither mammal population decreased in size after baiting, nor was there any increase in population turnover rates or changes in the movement patterns of either species. Furthermore, no trapped animal tested positive for RhB, suggesting that these small mammals rarely consume meat baits, and that, at the population level, the impact of baiting on them was likely negligible. It is therefore unlikely that the current practise of aerial baiting in NSW, although effective in reducing dog activity, threatens populations of these two common species and perhaps small mammals in general.

TI Field-based evaluation of scat DNA methods to estimate population
   abundance of the spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), a rare

AB Context. DNA extracted non-invasively from remotely collected scat samples has been used successfully to enumerate populations of a few endangered mammal species. However, scat DNA surveys relying on scent-marking behaviours need to identify if age-or sex-specific variations or seasonal changes in scat scent-marking patterns affect population estimates. Furthermore, owing to the low quantity and quality of scat DNA, a thorough assessment of the technique is needed when it is applied to different species to ensure that individual identification is reliable.
   Aims. In the current study, microsatellite genetic profiles derived from 208 remotely collected scats of the spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), a rare Australian marsupial carnivore, were compared with DNA profiles from tissue of 22 live-trapped individuals from the same study area to critically assess the reliability of the non-invasive method to estimate population abundance.
   Methods. Scat samples were collected at scent-marking sites over 4 consecutive months (April-July 2005), 7 weeks of which overlapped with the trapping program to allow direct comparisons of population estimates.
   Key results. Combining a multiple-tubes approach with error checking analyses provided reliable genetic tags and resulted in the detection of the majority of the live- trapped population (18 of 22 individuals). Ten additional individuals not known from trapping were also observed from scat DNA. A longer-term sampling regime was required for scats than for trapping to allow direct detection of a large proportion of the population and to provide a comparable population estimate. Critically, the 4-month scat collection period highlighted the importance of performing scat surveys during the mating season when scat scent marking is more frequent, and to avoid sex and age biases in scat marking patterns.
   Implications. Non-invasive scat DNA sampling methods that rely on scent-marking behaviours need to consider the duration of the sampling period and temporal differences in behaviours by the sexes and age groups to ensure that meaningful population estimates are achieved.
