methods;IPM, heterogeneity, estimation, assumptions;integrated population models: model assumptions and inference;"bayesian; heterogeneity; integrated population models; model assumption violation; parameter estimation";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"RIECKE TV;WILLIAMS PJ;BEHNKE TL;GIBSON D;LEACH AG;SEDINGER BS;STREET PA;SEDINGER JS";integrated population models (ipms) have become increasingly popular for the modelling of populations, as investigators seek to combine survey and demographic data to understand processes governing population dynamics. these models are particularly useful for identifying and exploring knowledge gaps within life histories, because they allow investigators to estimate biologically meaningful parameters, such as immigration or reproduction, that were previously unidentifiable without additional data. as ipms have been developed relatively recently, there is much to learn about model behaviour. behaviour of parameters, such as estimates near boundaries, and the consequences of varying degrees of dependency among datasets, has been explored. however, the reliability of parameter estimates remains underexamined, particularly when models include parameters that are not identifiable from one data source, but are indirectly identifiable from multiple datasets and a presumed model structure, such as the estimation of immigration using capture-recapture, fecundity and count data, combined with a life-history model. to examine the behaviour of model parameter estimates, we simulated stable populations closed to immigration and emigration. we simulated two scenarios that might induce error into survival estimates: marker induced bias in the capture-mark-recapture data and heterogeneity in the mortality process. we subsequently fit capture-mark-recapture, state-space and fecundity models, as well as ipms that estimated additional parameters. simulation results suggested that when model assumptions are violated, estimation of additional, previously unidentifiable, parameters using ipms may be extremely sensitive to these violations of model assumption. for example, when annual marker loss was simulated, estimates of survival rates were low and estimates of immigration rate from an ipm were high. when heterogeneity in the mortality process was induced, there were substantial relative differences between the medians of posterior distributions and truth for juvenile survival and fecundity. our results have important implications for biological inference when using ipms, as well as future model development and implementation. specifically, using multiple datasets to identify additional parameters resulted in the posterior distributions of additional parameters directly reflecting the effects of the violations of model assumptions in integrated modelling frameworks. we suggest that investigators interpret posterior distributions of these parameters as a combination of biological process and systematic error.

methods;SCR, closure, assumptions;population closure and the bias-precision trade-off in spatial capture-recapture;"mortality; population dynamics; recruitment; spatial capture-recapture; time-to-event modelling";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"DUPONT P;MILLERET C;GIMENEZ O;BISCHOF R";spatial capture-recapture (scr) is an increasingly popular method for estimating ecological parameters. scr often relies on data collected over relatively long sampling periods. while longer sampling periods can yield larger sample sizes and thus increase the precision of estimates, they also increase the risk of violating the closure assumption, thereby potentially introducing bias. the sampling period characteristics are therefore likely to play an important role in this bias-precision trade-off. yet few studies have studied this trade-off and none has done so for scr models. in this study, we explored the influence of the length and timing of the sampling period on the bias-precision trade-off of scr population size estimators. using a continuous time-to-event approach, we simulated populations with a wide range of life histories and sampling periods before quantifying the bias and precision of population size estimates returned by scr models. while longer sampling periods benefit the study of slow-living species (increased precision and lower bias), they lead to pronounced overestimation of population size for fast-living species. in addition, we show that both bias and uncertainty increase when the sampling period overlaps the reproductive season of the study species. based on our findings, we encourage investigators to carefully consider the life history of their study species when contemplating the length and the timing of the sampling period. we argue that both spatial and non-spatial capture-recapture studies can safely extend the sampling period to increase precision, as long as it is timed to avoid peak recruitment periods. the simulation framework we propose here can be used to guide decisions regarding the sampling period for a specific situation.

methods;abundance, multistate models;estimation of population size when capture probability depends on individual states;"abundance; closed population; individual heterogeneity; transition probabilities";JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS;"WORTHINGTON H;MCCREA RS;KING R;GRIFFITHS RA";we develop a multi-state model to estimate the size of a closed population from capture-recapture studies. we consider the case where capture-recapture data are not of a simple binary form, but where the state of an individual is also recorded upon every capture as a discrete variable. the proposed multi-state model can be regarded as a generalisation of the commonly applied set of closed population models to a multi-state form. the model allows for heterogeneity within the capture probabilities associated with each state while also permitting individuals to move between the different discrete states. a closed-form expression for the likelihood is presented in terms of a set of sufficient statistics. the link between existing models for capture heterogeneity is established, and simulation is used to show that the estimate of population size can be biased when movement between states is not accounted for. the proposed unconditional approach is also compared to a conditional approach to assess estimation bias. the model derived in this paper is motivated by a real ecological data set on great crested newts, triturus cristatus. supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.
methods;NA;the recent past and promising future for data integration methods to estimate species' distributions;"data fusion; integrated distribution model; joint likelihood; spatial point process; species distribution modelling";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"MILLER DAW;PACIFICI K;SANDERLIN JS;REICH BJ";with the advance of methods for estimating species distribution models has come an interest in how to best combine datasets to improve estimates of species distributions. this has spurred the development of data integration methods that simultaneously harness information from multiple datasets while dealing with the specific strengths and weaknesses of each dataset. we outline the general principles that have guided data integration methods and review recent developments in the field. we then outline key areas that allow for a more general framework for integrating data and provide suggestions for improving sampling design and validation for integrated models. key to recent advances has been using point-process thinking to combine estimators developed for different data types. extending this framework to new data types will further improve our inferences, as well as relaxing assumptions about how parameters are jointly estimated. these along with the better use of information regarding sampling effort and spatial autocorrelation will further improve our inferences. recent developments form a strong foundation for implementation of data integration models. wider adoption can improve our inferences about species distributions and the dynamic processes that lead to distributional shifts.

methods;Robust design, BUGS, temporary emigration;parameterizing the robust design in the bugs language: lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during growth on a long-lived bird;"bayesian; branta bernicla nigricans; breeding probability; capture-mark-recapture; carry-over effects; fitness; population dynamics; robust design";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"RIECKE TV;LEACH AG;GIBSON D;SEDINGER JS";since the initial development of the robust design, this capture-recapture model structure has been modified to estimate temporary emigration and expanded to include auxiliary information such as band recovery and live resight data using maximum likelihood approaches. these developments have allowed investigators to separately assess individual and group effects on true survival, site fidelity, and temporary emigration. additionally, recent advances in the bugs language have allowed researchers to develop increasingly complex, user-specified models in bayesian frameworks. the robust design has rarely been implemented in the bugs language, and previous attempts to parameterize the robust design in bugs exhibited strong bias in estimates of temporary emigration rates. given the limitations of current parameterizations of the robust design in bayesian frameworks, and our research objectives, we have developed a parameterization of the robust design in the bugs language that produces unbiased estimates of all model parameters. we use this novel model structure to examine lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during early life on annual breeding probabilities of pacific black brent branta bernicla nigricans breeding on the yukon-kuskokwim river delta in western alaska. we found that individuals that were more structurally developed as goslings bred at increased rates as adults (beta = 0.14, f = 0.94), with no effect on adult survival (beta = 0.01, f = 0.62). additionally, we provide evidence for long-term declines in apparent survival of breeding adult females at the population level (beta = -0.01, f = 0.90). this novel model structure can be easily expanded (gibson et al., in press) and has important implications for population modelling at broad scales, where we apply it to a declining population of pacific black brent. given long-term declines in gosling growth on the yukon-kuskokwim delta, we predict future declines in population trajectories as a result of lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during growth on adult fecundity and long-term declines in adult survival.

methods;Recruitment, point process, spatial;estimating recruitment from capture-recapture data by modelling spatio-temporal variation in birth and age-specific survival rates;"birth-death process; camera trapping; individual-based models; spatial capture-recapture; spatial demography; spatio-temporal point process; white-tailed deer";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"CHANDLER RB;ENGEBRETSEN K;CHERRY MJ;GARRISON EP;MILLER KV";1. understanding the factors influencing recruitment in animal populations is an important objective of many research and conservation programmes. however, evaluating hypotheses is challenging because recruitment is the outcome of birth and survival processes that are difficult to directly observe. capture-recapture is the most general framework for estimating recruitment in the presence of observation error, but existing methods ignore the underlying birth and survival processes, as well as age effects and spatial variation in vital rates. 2. we present an individual-based, spatio-temporal model that can be fit to capture-recapture data to draw inferences on the birth and survival processes governing recruitment dynamics. the number, dates, and spatial distribution of births are modelled as outcomes of a point process, and survival is modelled using a failure time approach. survival parameters can be modelled as functions of individuals traits and time-varying, spatial covariates. continuous-and discrete-time formulations are possible. we demonstrate the model using 7 months of camera data collected on white-tailed deer odocoileus virginianus fawns in big cypress national preserve. spot patterns were used to individually identify 28 fawns, detected 1,454 times between december 1, 2015 and july 1, 2016. 3. a total of 37 (95% ci: 30-49) fawns were born, of which 16 (95% ci: 10-23) survived 180 days to the recruitment age. mean parturition date was february 14 (95% ci: february 6-february 22), much earlier than in more temperate parts of the species' range, but coinciding with the dry season in southern florida. we found little evidence that mortality rates decreased with age, but the estimate of the age effect was imprecise. in contrast, we found strong evidence that encounter rates were age-specific and increased rapidly over the first month of life as fawns became more mobile. 4. our case study demonstrates the potential of this new model for advancing knowledge of spatial population dynamics by providing insights into the birth and juvenile survival processes that influence recruitment. because the model can be applied to data from noninvasive survey methods such as camera trapping, it is possible to apply it at broad spatial scales to understand how environmental variables and predator communities influence recruitment.
methods;Species richness;joining the incompatible: exploiting purposive lists for the sample-based estimation of species richness;"difference estimator; probabilistic sampling; purposive survey; supporting list; simulation";ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS;"CHIARUCCI A;DI BIASE RM;FATTORINI L;MARCHESELLI M;PISANI C";the lists of species obtained by purposive sampling by field ecologists can be used to improve the sample-based estimation of species richness. a new estimator is here proposed as a modification of the difference estimator in which the species inclusion probabilities are estimated by means of the species frequencies from incidence data. if the species list used to support the estimation is complete the estimator guesses the true richness without error. in the case of incomplete lists, the estimator provides values invariably greater than the number of species detected by the combination of sample-based and purposive surveys. an asymptotically conservative estimator of the mean squared error is also provided. a simulation study based on two artificial communities is carried out in order to check the obvious increase in accuracy and precision with respect to the widely applied estimators based on the sole sample information. finally, the proposed estimator is adopted to estimate species richness in the maremma regional park, italy.
methods;Bioacoustic, SCR;modelling sound attenuation in heterogeneous environments for improved bioacoustic sampling of wildlife populations;"acoustic monitoring; bioacoustics; distance sampling; least-cost path models; sound attenuation; sound pressure audiogram; spatial capture-recapture; telemetry";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;ROYLE JA;1. acoustic sampling methods are becoming increasingly important in biological monitoring. sound attenuation is one of the most important dynamics affecting the utility of acoustic data as it directly affects the probability of detection of individuals by acoustic sensor arrays and especially the localization of acoustic signals necessary in telemetry studies. therefore, models of sound attenuation are necessary to make efficient use of acoustic data in ecological monitoring and assessment applications. models of attenuation in widespread use are based on euclidean distance between source and sensor, which is justified under spherical attenuation of sound waves in homogeneous environments. 2. in this paper, i develop a model of sound attenuation based on a non-euclidean cost-weighted distance metric which contains attenuation coefficients that characterize the attenuation of sound due to environmental heterogeneity in the vicinity of an acoustic sensor array. 3. i show that parameters of the proposed attenuation model can be estimated by maximum likelihood using experimental data from an array of fixed sources, thus allowing investigators who use bioacoustic methods to devise explicit models of sound attenuation in situ and apply them to localization of sources and density estimation. in addition, drawing on analogy with spatial capture-recapture models, i argue that parameters of the non-euclidean model of attenuation can be estimated when source locations are unknown. thus, the models can be applied to real field studies which require estimation of attenuation parameters or localization of signals. 4. models of heterogeneous sound attenuation allow more accurate descriptions of acoustic monitoring data, and therefore should produce more accurate estimates of ecological parameters of interest, including source locations, density, and movement trajectories. moreover, the ability to test specific hypotheses about the effects of habitat and landscape structure on sound attenuation can improve the design of acoustic monitoring arrays and lead to more efficient deployment of acoustic sensing technology.
methods;Recruitment;a length-based mark-recapture model for estimating abundance and recruitment: removing bias due to size-selective capture gear;"mark-recapture; growth; abundance; size selectivity; length-based model; bias";ECOLOGICAL MODELLING;"VAN POORTEN BT;TAYLOR N;O BRIEN D;WALTERS CJ";we describe an unbiased length-based, age-structured mark-recapture (lamr) model for estimating length based abundance and recruitment of fish populations. many mark-recapture studies employ capture gear that is size-selective, leading to a larger and faster growing marked sub-population with a different capture probability than the unmarked sub-population, resulting in a basic violation of assumptions for many mark-recapture models. persistent differences in marked and unmarked individuals are estimated in our model using growth type group accounting. simulation-evaluation results indicate that the model produces largely unbiased estimates of recruitment and abundance across a range of sampling scenarios and population life-history types, and is robust to growth parameter misspecification. however, in older, slow growing populations, the model is prone to 'smearing' of recruitment estimates across early year-classes. the lamr model is applied to data from multiple wild populations of rainbow trout to estimate recruitment and abundance. overall, results indicate that the lamr model addresses shortcomings associated with using size-selective gear in mark-recapture studies to produce reliable estimates of recruitment and size-based abundance.
methods;SCR, genetic tagging;using partial aggregation in spatial capture recapture;"partially aggregated binary model; spatial capture recapture; wolverines";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"MILLERET C;DUPONT P;BROSETH H;KINDBERG J;ROYLE JA;BISCHOF R";1. spatial capture-recapture (scr) models are commonly used for analysing data collected using noninvasive genetic sampling (ngs). opportunistic ngs often leads to detections that do not occur at discrete detector locations. therefore, spatial aggregation of individual detections into fixed detectors (e.g., centre of grid cells) is an option to increase computing speed of scr analyses. however, it may reduce precision and accuracy of parameter estimations. 2. using simulations, we explored the impact that spatial aggregation of detections has on a trade-off between computing time and parameter precision and bias, under a range of biological conditions. we used three different observation models: the commonly used poisson and bernoulli models, as well as a novel way to partially aggregate detections (partially aggregated binary model [pab]) to reduce the loss of information after aggregating binary detections. the pab model divides detectors into k subdetectors and models the frequency of subdetectors with more than one detection as a binomial response with a sample size of k. finally, we demonstrate the consequences of aggregation and the use of the pab model using ngs data from the monitoring of wolverine (gulo gulo) in norway. 3. spatial aggregation of detections, while reducing computation time, does indeed incur costs in terms of reduced precision and accuracy, especially for the parameters of the detection function. scr models estimated abundance with a low bias (< 10%) even at high degree of aggregation, but only for the poisson and pab models. overall, the cost of aggregation is mitigated when using the poisson and pab models. at the same level of aggregation, the pab observation model out-performs the bernoulli model in terms of accuracy of estimates, while offering the benefits of a binary observation model (less assumptions about the underlying ecological process) over the count-based model. 4. we recommend that detector spacing after aggregation does not exceed 1.5 times the scale-parameter of the detection function in order to limit bias. we recommend the use of the pab observation model when performing spatial aggregation of binary data as it can mitigate the cost of aggregation, compared to the bernoulli model.

methods;Point process, continuous;markov-modulated poisson processes as a new framework for analysing capture-recapture data;"capture-recapture; likelihood; markov-modulated poisson process; non-constant time interval; uncertainty";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;CHOQUET R;1. opportunistic capture-recapture data consists of observations over non-constant time intervals and so fails to satisfy the basic assumptions of traditional capture-recapture models. analysing opportunistic capture-recapture data is often done by discretizing time intervals or summarizing data, but without taking into account the continuous time process of the state and/or the capture. 2. to deal with non-constant time-intervals, continuous time closed capture-recapture models have been proposed by yip, huggins, and lin (1996), hwang and chao (2002), schofield, barker, and gelling (2017) for estimating population size. more recently, a continuous time cormack-jolly-seber model has been proposed by fouchet, santin-janin, sauvage, yoccoz, and pontier (2016) to reduce bias in survival rates, and a two-state process has been proposed by choquet, garnier, awuve, and besnard (2017) to estimate reproduction rates and survival rates of young within a season. 3. the aim of the current study is to demonstrate how an approach based on a markov-modulated poisson process (mmpp) (freed & shepp, 1982) allows, in a similar way to a multistate model, to model opportunistic data, using several states. to this end, several multistate models were rewritten as mmpp models, showing, the potential for this approach to address the ecological questions as multistate models, but using an extended data framework. in particular, it is a useful framework for dealing with data that has unordered levels of uncertainty. 4. the methods were illustrated using simulations and analysis of data on the alpine ibex (capra ibex).

(2) a simple linear conversion function (number of missed individuals for each marked one) can be used to compute population size from the number of individuals marked over a small number of mrr sampling sessions. (3) parameterizing this function is system specific, because it depends on detectability of individuals, but only requires an initial effort of traditional high-effort mrr in a few populations encompassing the expected range of population size, combined with previous knowledge on the species about potential factors affecting detectability. our simplified mrr protocol should allow scientists to obtain absolute population size estimates almost as good as with traditional high-effort mrr, but at a cost lowered in both the marking procedure and the intensity of field visits.
methods;Assumptions, temporary emigration;performance of multistate mark-recapture models for temporary emigration in the presence of survival costs;"bias; power; simulation; survival; temporary emigration";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"HENLE K;GRUBER B";temporary emigration is widespread in animals and plants and has important implications for ecological processes, evolution and the conservation of species. it is increasingly studied with capture-mark-recapture (cmr) models. temporary emigration provides particular challenges to cmr analyses if it involves movement to an unobservable state. a multistate model in which individuals may move between an observable and an unobservable state (called te model) was developed for such cases. the model assumes equal survival probability in both states. this assumption may be violated, especially if temporary emigration involves trade-offs between survival and reproduction. a comprehensive assessment of the effects of unequal survival probability on power to detect temporary emigration and on bias and precision of estimates is still needed to understand the applicability and limits of the model. we assessed power to detect temporary emigration for four goodness-of-fit tests and evaluated bias and precision of estimates for the te model and for its combination with a robust design. our simulation study, based on 16,650 parameter combinations, shows that temporary emigration is more challenging than currently usually acknowledged. the tests 2.ct and 2.c are largely independent of the difference in survival probability between the states. in contrast, test 3.sr is sensitive to the difference in survival probability but also to emigration probability. tests 2.c and 2.ct have high power if a large part of the population temporarily emigrates and a large fraction of the individuals return on the next capture occasion. under this condition, bias is low and precision adequate even if the assumption of equal survival probability is violated. bias and precision are also satisfactory if the assumption is met but unsatisfactory or unreliable for the remaining parameter space. we conclude that the uncertainties whether an appropriate model was selected and whether the estimates from the selected model may be biased should be clearly communicated and that every endeavour should be made to make the unobservable state observable.
methods;Measurement errors chao;a generalized chao estimator with measurement error and external information;"chao estimator; external information; simex";ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS;"DOTTO F;FARCOMENI A";we present a generalized chao (gc) estimator based on a subject-occasion-specific design matrix. we then extend the gc estimator to (i) external information, in the form of non-linear constraints on subpopulation sizes and (ii) measurement error. for the first, we propose a reparameterization of the estimating equations. as a result, the constrained mle can be found with no additional computational efforts. for the second we generalize simex procedure to multiple measurement methods. in simulation we show that (even incorrect) external information can substantially decrease the mse. we illustrate with an application to a whale shark (rhincodon typus) population, where mostly jouvenile males are observed. we use external information on gender ratio of whale sharks to correct for low catchability of females, and our multivariate simex procedure to correct for measurement error in assessment of shark length. the resulting population size estimates are about 60% larger than the unconstrained-uncorrected counterparts.

methods;Continuous, opportunistic;transient state estimation using continuous-time processes applied to opportunistic capture-recapture data;"breeding; continuous modeling; markov model; opportunistic data; survival";ECOLOGICAL MODELLING;"CHOQUET R;GARNIER A;AWUVE E;BESNARD A";typically, analyze of capture-recapture data rely on standard protocols of individual detection. encounters and reencounters of marked individuals are made during short sessions separated by constant time intervals. very often, it can be reasonably assumed that the time between two sessions is the same for all individuals. however, in some studies, data is collected opportunistically within a season. this is often due to difficulties concerning fieldwork and/or a lack of people involved in data collection. it can also be intentionally chosen, for example, if collecting data within a season provides additional information on the status of the individual (e.g. whether it is a breeder or a non-breeder). when using capture-recapture data, opportunistic data has typically been analyzed by using discretize time intervals, to avoid taking into account the continuous-time processes of state and capture. in this study, we modeled the transition between a transient state (non-breeder) to one absorbing state (breeder) in a continuous process over time. a poisson point process was used to model the capture data, allowing us to directly model the opportunistic data set. the main advantage of this new approach is that it allows a full use of opportunistic data - i.e. all available information can be used. as an illustrative working example, we applied the approach to investigate alpine ibex (capra ibex) reproduction over one year. we jointly estimated the following parameters: the breeding rate in the summer and the survival rate of the young from birth to the following spring. our findings suggest that this modeling approach has the potential to open new perspectives in population ecology.

(2011) have shown that, for densities in the katz family, these ratios can be modeled by a regression approach, and rocchetti et al. (2014) have specialized the approach to the beta-binomial distribution. once the regression model has been estimated, the unobserved frequency of zero counts can be simply derived. the guiding principle is that it is often easier to find an appropriate regression model than a proper model for the count distribution. however, a full analysis of the connection between the regression model and the associated count distribution has been missing. in this manuscript, we fill the gap and show that the regression model approach leads, under general conditions, to a valid count distribution; we also consider a wider class of regression models, based on fractional polynomials. the proposed approach is illustrated by analyzing various empirical applications, and by means of a simulation study."

methods;HMM, memory;semi-markov arnason-schwarz models;"capture-recapture-recovery; dwell-time distribution; hidden markov model; multi-state model";BIOMETRICS;"KING R;LANGROCK R";we consider multi-state capture-recapture-recovery data where observed individuals are recorded in a set of possible discrete states. traditionally, the arnason-schwarz model has been fitted to such data where the state process is modeled as a first-order markov chain, though second-order models have also been proposed and fitted to data. however, low-order markov models may not accurately represent the underlying biology. for example, specifying a (time-independent) first-order markov process involves the assumption that the dwell time in each state (i.e., the duration of a stay in a given state) has a geometric distribution, and hence that the modal dwell time is one. specifying time-dependent or higher-order processes provides additional flexibility, but at the expense of a potentially significant number of additional model parameters. we extend the arnason-schwarz model by specifying a semi-markov model for the state process, where the dwell-time distribution is specified more generally, using, for example, a shifted poisson or negative binomial distribution. a state expansion technique is applied in order to represent the resulting semi-markov arnason-schwarz model in terms of a simpler and computationally tractable hidden markov model. semi-markov arnason-schwarz models come with only a very modest increase in the number of parameters, yet permit a significantly more flexible state process. model selection can be performed using standard procedures, and in particular via the use of information criteria. the semi-markov approach allows for important biological inference to be drawn on the underlying state process, for example, on the times spent in the different states. the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in a simulation study, before being applied to real data corresponding to house finches where the states correspond to the presence or absence of conjunctivitis.

methods;Natural selection, assumptions, covariates;the measurement of selection when detection is imperfect: how good are naive methods?;"capture-mark-recapture; directional selection; mark; natural selection; selection gradients; simulation; stabilizing selection";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"WALLER J;SVENSSON EI";1. the life spans of animals can be measured in natural populations by uniquely marking individuals and then releasing them into the field. selection on survival (a component of fitness) can subsequently be quantified by regressing the life spans of these marked individuals on their trait values. however, marked individuals are not always seen on every subsequent catching occasion, and for this reason, imperfect detection is considered a problem when estimating survival selection in natural populations. 2. capture-mark-recapture methods have been advocated as a powerful means to correct for imperfect detection. here, we use simulated and field data sets to evaluate the effect of assuming perfect detection ('naive methods'), when detection is really imperfect. we compared the performance of the naive methods with methods correcting for imperfect detection (mark-recapture methods, or mr). 3. although the effects of trait-dependent recapture probability are mitigated when recapture probability is high, mark-recapture methods still provide the safest choice when recapture probability might be trait-dependent. in our simulations, mark-recapture methods had a power advantage over naive methods, but all methods lost statistical power at low recapture probabilities. 4. the main advantage of mark-recapture methods over naive methods is the ability to control for hidden trait-dependent recapture probability, as it is often hard to tell a priori if trait dependence is an issue in a particular study. however, when trait-dependent recapture probability is weak, naive methods and mark-recapture methods perform similarly as long as recapture rates do not become too low, and the main problem of survival selection studies is still low statistical power. we provide a r package (easymark) alongside with this paper to facilitate future integration between mr methods and classical selection studies. easymark provides the opportunity to convert the regression coefficients from mr-approaches in to classical standardized selection gradients.

[biometrics 66 (2010) 178-185] provides a framework for modelling mark-recapture data with potential identification errors. key is a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) scheme for sampling configurations of the latent counts of the true capture histories that could have generated the observed data. assuming a linear map between the observed and latent counts, the mcmc algorithm uses vectors from a basis of the kernel to move between configurations of the latent data. schofield and bonner [biometrics 71 (2015) 1070-1080] shows that this is sufficient for some models within the framework but that a larger set called a markov basis is required when errors are more complex. we address two further challenges: (1) that models with complex error mechanisms may not fit within the lmm framework and (2) that markov bases can be difficult to compute for studies of even moderate size. we extend the framework to model the capture/demographic and error processes separately and develop a new mcmc algorithm using dynamic markov bases. our work is motivated by a study of queen snakes (regina septemvittata) and we use simulation to compare estimates of survival rates when snakes are marked with pit tags which have perfect identification versus brands which are prone to error.

methods;NA;a functional model for characterizing long-distance movement behaviour;"argos; bayesian model; canada lynx; functional data analysis; movement modelling; splines; telemetry";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"BUDERMAN FE;HOOTEN MB;IVAN JS;SHENK TM";advancements in wildlife telemetry techniques have made it possible to collect large data sets of highly accurate animal locations at a fine temporal resolution. these data sets have prompted the development of a number of statistical methodologies for modelling animal movement. telemetry data sets are often collected for purposes other than fine-scale movement analysis. these data sets may differ substantially from those that are collected with technologies suitable for fine-scale movement modelling and may consist of locations that are irregular in time, are temporally coarse or have large measurement error. these data sets are time-consuming and costly to collect but may still provide valuable information about movement behaviour. we developed a bayesian movement model that accounts for error from multiple data sources as well as movement behaviour at different temporal scales. the bayesian framework allows us to calculate derived quantities that describe temporally varying movement behaviour, such as residence time, speed and persistence in direction. the model is flexible, easy to implement and computationally efficient. we apply this model to data from colorado canada lynx (lynx canadensis) and use derived quantities to identify changes in movement behaviour.
methods;Species richness;estimating diversity via frequency ratios;"alpha diversity; biodiversity; capture-recapture; characterization of distributions; microbial ecology; species richness";BIOMETRICS;"WILLIS A;BUNGE J";we wish to estimate the total number of classes in a population based on sample counts, especially in the presence of high latent diversity. drawing on probability theory that characterizes distributions on the integers by ratios of consecutive probabilities, we construct a nonlinear regression model for the ratios of consecutive frequency counts. this allows us to predict the unobserved count and hence estimate the total diversity. we believe that this is the first approach to depart from the classical mixed poisson model in this problem. our method is geometrically intuitive and yields good fits to data with reasonable standard errors. it is especially well-suited to analyzing high diversity datasets derived from next-generation sequencing in microbial ecology. we demonstrate the method's performance in this context and via simulation, and we present a dataset for which our method outperforms all competitors.
methods;Point process, data combination, distance sampling;double-observer line transect surveys with markov-modulated poisson process models for animal availability;"abundance estimation; availability bias; cox point process; mark-recapture; maximum likelihood";BIOMETRICS;"BORCHERS DL;LANGROCK R";we develop maximum likelihood methods for line transect surveys in which animals go undetected at distance zero, either because they are stochastically unavailable while within view or because they are missed when they are available. these incorporate a markov-modulated poisson process model for animal availability, allowing more clustered availability events than is possible with poisson availability models. they include a mark-recapture component arising from the independent-observer survey, leading to more accurate estimation of detection probability given availability. we develop models for situations in which (a) multiple detections of the same individual are possible and (b) some or all of the availability process parameters are estimated from the line transect survey itself, rather than from independent data. we investigate estimator performance by simulation, and compare the multiple-detection estimators with estimators that use only initial detections of individuals, and with a single-observer estimator. simultaneous estimation of detection function parameters and availability model parameters is shown to be feasible from the line transect survey alone with multiple detections and double-observer data but not with single-observer data. recording multiple detections of individuals improves estimator precision substantially when estimating the availability model parameters from survey data, and we recommend that these data be gathered. we apply the methods to estimate detection probability from a double-observer survey of north atlantic minke whales, and find that double-observer data greatly improve estimator precision here too.

(2010, biometrics 66, 178-185) define a general framework for analyzing capture-recapture data with potential misidentifications. in this framework, the observed vector of counts, y, is considered as a linear function of a vector of latent counts, x, such that y = ax, with x assumed to follow a multinomial distribution conditional on the model parameters, theta. bayesian methods are then applied by sampling from the joint posterior distribution of both x and theta. in particular, link et al. (2010) propose a metropolis-hastings algorithm to sample from the full conditional distribution of x, where new proposals are generated by sequentially adding elements from a basis of the null space (kernel) of a. we consider this algorithm and show that using elements from a simple basis for the kernel of a may not produce an irreducible markov chain. instead, we require a markov basis, as defined by diaconis and sturmfels (1998, the annals of statistics 26, 363-397). we illustrate the importance of markov bases with three capture-recapture examples. we prove that a specific lattice basis is a markov basis for a class of models including the original model considered by link et al. (2010) and confirm that the specific basis used in their example with two sampling occasions is a markov basis. the constructive nature of our proof provides an immediate method to obtain a markov basis for any model in this class.
methods;Heterogeneity;mixture regression models for closed population capture-recapture data;"archimedean copulas; closed population; maximum likelihood; random unit effect; residual heterogeneity; unit level covariates";BIOMETRICS;"TOUNKARA F;RIVEST LP";in capture-recapture studies, the use of individual covariates has been recommended to get stable population estimates. however, some residual heterogeneity might still exist and ignoring such heterogeneity could lead to underestimating the population size (n). in this work, we explore two new models with capture probabilities depending on both covariates and unobserved random effects, to estimate the size of a population. inference techniques including horvitz-thompson estimate and confidence intervals for the population size, are derived. the selection of a particular model is carried out using the akaike information criterion (aic). first, we extend the random effect model of darroch et al. (1993, journal of american statistical association 88, 1137-1148) to handle unit level covariates and discuss its limitations. the second approach is a generalization of the traditional zero-truncated binomial model that includes a random effect to account for an unobserved heterogeneity. this approach provides useful tools for inference about n, since key quantities such as moments, likelihood functions and estimates of n and their standard errors have closed form expressions. several models for the unobserved heterogeneity are available and the marginal capture probability is expressed using the logit and the complementary log-log link functions. the sensitivity of the inference to the specification of a model is also investigated through simulations. a numerical example is presented. we compare the performance of the proposed estimator with that obtained under model m-h of huggins (1989 biometrika 76, 130-140).

methods;IPM, immigration, assumptions;estimating immigration using a bayesian integrated population model: choice of parametrization and priors;"bayesian model; immigration; integrated population model; prior sensitivity; source-sink dynamics";ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS;"SCHAUB M;FLETCHER D";bayesian integrated population modelling provides a natural tool for estimating immigration into a single study population when we have indices of population size, mark-recapture data and fecundity data. we consider the choice of both the parametrization of immigration and its prior. using a simulation study for a model that is typical of those used for short-live bird species, we assess the effect of specifying immigration in terms of the number of immigrants each year, as opposed to an immigration rate. we also assess the effect of the assumption of independence of the data sets, which is commonly required in such modelling. if immigration is occurring, our results suggest that parametrizing the model in terms of number of immigrants will provide a more precise estimate, compared to a parametrization involving an immigration rate, even if we wish to estimate the rate. if there is little or no immigration, use of a model parametrized in terms of an immigration rate can result in overestimation, whereas a model in which immigration is specified as a number offers the possibility to use priors that have a negative lower bound with the consequence that immigration is correctly estimated. use of such a model appears to be robust to the assumption of independence being wrong, our results for independent and dependent data sets being remarkably similar in terms of the distribution, across all simulations, of the posterior means and standard deviations.

methods;NA;estimating the size of populations at high risk for hiv using respondent-driven sampling data;"hard-to-reach population sampling; model-based survey sampling; network sampling; social networks; successive sampling";BIOMETRICS;"HANDCOCK MS;GILE KJ;MAR CM";the study of hard-to-reach populations presents significant challenges. typically, a sampling frame is not available, and population members are difficult to identify or recruit from broader sampling frames. this is especially true of populations at high risk for hiv/aids. respondent-driven sampling (rds) is often used in such settings with the primary goal of estimating the prevalence of infection. in such populations, the number of people at risk for infection and the number of people infected are of fundamental importance. this article presents a case-study of the estimation of the size of the hard-to-reach population based on data collected through rds. we study two populations of female sex workers and men-who-have-sex-with-men in el salvador. the approach is bayesian and we consider different forms of prior information, including using the unaids population size guidelines for this region. we show that the method is able to quantify the amount of information on population size available in rds samples. as separate validation, we compare our results to those estimated by extrapolating from a capture-recapture study of el salvadorian cities. the results of our case-study are largely comparable to those of the capture-recapture study when they differ from the unaids guidelines. our method is widely applicable to data from rds studies and we provide a software package to facilitate this.

(methods in ecology and evolution, 2013, 4, 520) proposed a spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) model in which an animal's usage of a site, and hence its probability of detection, depends on a function of site-specific covariates normalized using a weighted sum of such values across the animal's home range. 2. from simulations supposedly based on the model, they drew the conclusion that existing methods will produce 'extremely biased' estimates of population size when animals use space selectively. this conclusion is faulty because they simulated data from a different model, omitting the normalization needed to represent selection of resources at the home-range level. 3. new simulations show that the null secr estimator of population size is nearly unbiased for low to moderate levels of selective space use when the generating model includes normalization. including detector-level covariates of detection, as allowed in standard software, nearly eliminates bias due to strongly selective space use, whether or not the generating model includes normalization.

(methods in ecology and evolution, 2013, 4). 3. a key point of royle et al. (methods in ecology and evolution, 2013, 4) was that active resource selection induces heterogeneity in encounter probability which, if unaccounted for, should bias estimates of population size or density. the models of royle et al.

methods;SSM, bioacoustic;estimating individual animal movement from observation networks;"acoustic telemetry; detection probability; ornstein-uhlenbeck process; state-space model";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"PEDERSEN MW;WENG KC";observation network data comprise animal presences detected by observer stations at fixed spatial locations. statistical analysis of these data is complicated by spatial bias in sampling and temporal variability in detection conditions. advanced methods for analysis of these data are required but are currently underdeveloped. we propose a state-space model (ssm) for observation network data to estimate detailed movements of individual animals. the underlying movement model is an ornstein-uhlenbeck (ou) process, which is stationary, and therefore has an inherent mechanism that models home range behaviour. an integral part of the approach is the detection function, which models the probability of logging animal presences. the detection function is also used to provide absence information when animals are undetected. since the ability to detect an animal often depends on time-varying external factors such as environmental conditions, we use covariate information about detection efficiency as control variables. via simulation, we found that movement estimation error scales log-linearly with network sparsity. this result can be used to indicate the number of stations necessary to achieve a desired upper bound on estimation error. furthermore, we found that the ssm outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimating detailed movements and that estimates are robust towards mis-specification of the detection function. we also tested the importance of accounting for time-varying detection conditions and found that the probability of making wrong conclusions decreases substantially when covariate information is exploited. the model is used to estimate movements and home range of a humphead wrasse (cheilinus undulatus) at palmyra atoll in the central pacific ocean. here, detection conditions have a strong diel component, which is controlled for using detection efficiency information from a reference device. the presented approach enhances the toolbox for analysis of observation network data as collected by acoustic telemetry or potentially other aspiring methods such as camera trapping and mobile phone tagging. by explicitly modelling movement and observation processes, the model integrates all sources of uncertainty and provides a sound statistical basis for making well-informed management decisions from imperfect information.

methods;continuous, telemetry;apparent survival estimation from continuous mark-recapture/resighting data;"barker joint data; cormack-jolly-seber; model structure adequacy; telemetry";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"BARBOUR AB;PONCIANO JM;LORENZEN K";1. the recent expansion of continuous-resighting telemetry methods (e.g. acoustic receivers, pit tag antennae) has created a class of ecological data not well suited for traditional mark-recapture statistics. estimating survival when continuous recapture data is available ensues a practical problem, because classical capture-recapture models were derived under a discrete sampling scheme that assumes sampling events are instantaneous with respect to the interval between events. 2. to investigate the use of continuous data in survival analysis, we conducted a model structure adequacy simulation that tested the cormack-jolly-seber (cjs) and barker joint data survival estimation models, which mainly differ through the barker's inclusion of secondary period information. we simulated a population in which survival and detection occurred as a near continuous (daily) process and collapsed detection information into monthly sampling bins for survival estimation. 3. while both models performed well when survival was time-independent, the cjs was substantially biased for low survival values and time-dependent conditions. additionally, unlike the cjs, the barker model consistently performed well over multiple sample sizes (number of marked individuals). however, the high number of parameters in the barker model led to convergence difficulties, resulting in a need for an alternative optimization method (simulated annealing). 4. we recommend the use of the barker model when using continuous data for survival analysis, because it outperformed the cjs over a biologically reasonable range of potential parameter values. however, the practical difficulty of implementing the barker model combined with its shortcomings during two simulations leaves room for the specification of novel statistical methods tailored specifically for continuous mark-resighting data.

methods;software, species richness;program simassem: software for simulating species assemblages and estimating species richness;"biodiversity; community ecology; landscape ecology; relative abundance distribution; simulation; spatial aggregation";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"REESE GC;WILSON KR;FLATHER CH";1. species richness, the number of species in a defined area, is the most frequently used biodiversity measure. despite its intuitive appeal and conceptual simplicity, species richness is often difficult to quantify, even in well-surveyed areas, because of sampling limitations such as survey effort and species detection probability. nonparametric estimators have generally performed better than other options, but no particular estimator has consistently performed best across variation in assemblage and survey parameters. 2. in order to evaluate estimator performances, we developed the program simassem. simassem can: (i) simulate assemblages and surveys with user-specified parameters, (ii) process existing species encounter history files, (iii) generate species richness estimates not available in other programs and (iv) format encounter history data for several other programs. 3. simassem can help elucidate relationships between assemblage and survey parameters and the performance of species richness estimators, thereby increasing our understanding of estimator sensitivity, improving estimator development and defining the bounds for appropriate application.

(methods in ecology and evolution 2011; 2: 390) proposes a modification of the jolly-seber estimator for such data computed by adjusting the observed counts of individuals first captured, recaptured or not captured but known to be alive on each occasion. the adjustment involves multiplying each of these counts by a constant factor, iid, intended to correct for double counting of individuals and constrained between 0 and 1. results of a simulation study provided in madon etal. (methods in ecology and evolution 2011; 2: 390) show that the proposed estimator is almost unbiased, but its uncertainty is underestimated and the true coverage of confidence intervals is consistently below the nominal value. i compute separate adjustment factors for each of the counts and show (i) that a constant adjustment is not appropriate and (ii) that the theoretical adjustment factor is sometimes >1. i believe that the use of a single adjustment factor between 0 and 1 is what causes the uncertainty to be underestimated and that complete models of the observation process are required to obtain valid results."

[journal of the royal statistical society: series b (statistical methodology), 70, 445460, 2008] presents one solution to this problem by constructing a conditional likelihood depending only on the observed covariate information the so-called trinomial model. this paper describes the link between the trinomial model and the markrecapturerecovery model of burnham (marked individuals in the study of bird population, 199213, 1993) and shows how the trinomial model can be implemented in the software package program mark. this provides the user with access to all of the features of program mark including the facilities for model building and model selection without having to write custom code. i provide details on the analysis of a simulated data set and discuss an r package developed to help users format their data and to implement the model through the existing rmark package.

methods;Data combination, photo-id, genetic tagging;a new method for estimating animal abundance with two sources of data in capture-recapture studies;"abundance; humpback whales; joint modelling; jolly-seber model; open population; two-source jolly-seber model";METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"MADON B;GIMENEZ O;MCARDLE B;BAKER CS;GARRIGUE C";1. mark-recapture studies are often used to estimate population size based on a single source of individual identification data such as natural markings or artificial tags. however, with the development of molecular ecology, multiple sources of identification can be obtained for some species and combining them to obtain population size estimates would certainly provide better information about abundance than each survey can provide alone. 2. we propose an extension of the jolly-seber model to infer abundance by combining two sources of capture-recapture data. the need to merge both sources of data was motivated by studies of humpback whales in which both photo-identification and dna from skin biopsy samples are often collected. as whales are not necessarily available by both sampling methods on any given occasion, they can appear twice in the combined data set if no combined sampling ever occurred during the survey, i.e. being photographed and genotyped on the same occasion. our model thus combines the two sources of information by estimating the possible overlap. monte carlo simulations are used to assess the properties of the present estimator that is then used to estimate the size of the humpback whale population in new caledonia. the new open-population estimator is also compared with classic closed-population estimators incorporating either temporal and/or individual heterogeneity in the capture probability: the purpose was to evaluate which approach (closed or open population) was the least biased for an open population with individual heterogeneous capture probabilities. 3. when all assumptions are met, the estimator is unbiased as long as the probability of being double-tagged (e. g. photographed and biopsied on the same occasion) on every occasion is above 0 2. 4. the humpback whale case study in new caledonia shows that our two-source jolly-seber (tsjs) estimator could be more efficient in estimating population size than models based only on one type of data. for monitoring purposes, the proposed method provides an efficient alternative to the existing approaches and a productive direction for future work to deal with multiple sources of data to estimate abundance. 5. r-codes formatting the data and implementing the tsjs model are provided in resource s5.
methods;NA;theory put into practice: an r implementation of the infinite-dimensional model;"evolution; function valued trait; infinite-dimensional model; growth trajectory; phenotypic variation; selection";ECOLOGICAL MODELLING;"KUPARINEN A;BYORKLUND M";the infinite dimensional model (idm) is an approach that has been developed for the analyses of phenotypic variation in function valued traits such as growth trajectories and continuous reaction norms. this model is particularly suited for the analysis of the potential and the constraints for growth to evolve under selection on body size. despite of its applicability to a broad range of study systems idm has only been applied in a handful of studies, as it is mathematically demanding for scientists not familiar with quantitative genetics methods. here, we present a user-friendly r implementation of idm, demonstrate its performance with growth data on nine-spined stickleback (pungitius pungitius). in addition to rearing experiments, individual based size-at-age trajectories are often measured in wild in mark-recapture studies or estimated retrospectively from scales or bones. therefore, our r implementation of idm should be applicable to many studies conducted in wild and in a lab, and be useful by making the methodologically challenging idm approach more easily accessible also in the fields where quantitative genetics methods are less standardly used.

methods;Record linkage;a hierarchical bayesian approach to record linkage and population size problems;"capture-recapture methods; conditional independence; gibbs sampling; metropolis-hastings; record linkage";ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS;"TANCREDI A;LISEO B";we propose and illustrate a hierarchical bayesian approach for matching statistical records observed on different occasions. we show how this model can be profitably adopted both in record linkage problems and in capture-recapture setups, where the size of a finite population is the real object of interest. there are at least two important differences between the proposed model-based approach and the current practice in record linkage. first, the statistical model is built up on the actually observed categorical variables and no reduction (to 0-1 comparisons) of the available information takes place. second, the hierarchical structure of the model allows a two-way propagation of the uncertainty between the parameter estimation step and the matching procedure so that no plug-in estimates are used and the correct uncertainty is accounted for both in estimating the population size and in performing the record linkage. we illustrate and motivate our proposal through a real data example and simulations.
methods;Individual growth;a new method for estimating growth transition matrices;"growth; length-based models; mark-recapture; transition matrices";BIOMETRICS;HILLARY RM;the vast majority of population models work using age or stage not length but there are many cases where animals cannot be aged sensibly or accurately. for these cases length-based models form the logical alternative but there has been little work done to develop and compare different methods of estimating growth transition matrices to be used in such models. this article demonstrates how a consistent bayesian framework for estimating growth parameters and a novel method for constructing length transition matrices accounts for variation in growth in a clear and consistent manner and avoids potential subjective choices required using more established methods. the inclusion of the resultant growth uncertainty in population assessment models and the potential impact on management decisions is also addressed.
methods;Model selection, memory;multistate mark-recapture model selection using score tests;"branta canadensis; canada goose; mark-recapture; memory model; model selection";BIOMETRICS;"MCCREA RS;MORGAN BJT";although multistate mark-recapture models are recognized as important, they lack a simple model-selection procedure. this article proposes and evaluates a step-up approach to select appropriate models for multistate mark-recapture data using score tests. only models supported by the data require fitting, so that over-complicated model structures with too many parameters do not need to be considered. typically only a small number of models are fitted, and the procedure is also able to identify parameter-redundant and near-redundant models. the good performance of the technique is demonstrated using simulation, and the approach is illustrated on a three-region canada goose data set. in this case, it identifies a new model that is much simpler than the best model previously considered for this application.

ecological;heterogeneity, assumptions;revisiting the effect of capture heterogeneity on survival estimates in capture-mark-recapture studies: does it matter?;NA;PLOS ONE;"ABADI F;BOTHA A;ALTWEGG R";recently developed capture-mark-recapture methods allow us to account for capture heterogeneity among individuals in the form of discrete mixtures and continuous individual random effects. in this article, we used simulations and two case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of continuously distributed individual random effects at removing potential bias due to capture heterogeneity, and to evaluate in what situation the added complexity of these models is justified. simulations and case studies showed that ignoring individual capture heterogeneity generally led to a small negative bias in survival estimates and that individual random effects effectively removed this bias. as expected, accounting for capture heterogeneity also led to slightly less precise survival estimates. our case studies also showed that accounting for capture heterogeneity increased in importance towards the end of study. though ignoring capture heterogeneity led to a small bias in survival estimates, such bias may greatly impact management decisions. we advocate reducing potential heterogeneity at the sampling design stage. where this is insufficient, we recommend modelling individual capture heterogeneity in situations such as when a large proportion of the individuals has a low detection probability (e.g. in the presence of floaters) and situations where the most recent survival estimates are of great interest (e.g. in applied conservation).

ecological;multilist;estimating the completeness of death registration: an empirical method;NA;PLOS ONE;"ADAIR T;LOPEZ AD";introduction many national and subnational governments need to routinely measure the completeness of death registration for monitoring and statistical purposes. existing methods, such as death distribution and capture-recapture methods, have a number of limitations such as inaccuracy and complexity that prevent widespread application. this paper presents a novel empirical method to estimate completeness of death registration at the national and subnational level. methods random-effects models to predict the logit of death registration completeness were developed from 2,451 country-years in 110 countries from 1970 +/- 2015 using the global burden of disease 2015 database. predictors include the registered crude death rate, under-five mortality rate, population age structure and under-five death registration completeness. models were developed separately for males, females and both sexes. findings all variables are highly significant and reliably predict completeness of registration across a wide range of registered crude death rates (r-squared 0.85). mean error is highest at medium levels of observed completeness. the models show quite close agreement between predicted and observed completeness for populations outside the dataset. there is high concordance with the hybrid death distribution method in brazilian states. uncertainty in the under-five mortality rate, assessed using the dataset and in colombian departmentos, has minimal impact on national level predicted completeness, but a larger effect at the subnational level. conclusions the method demonstrates sufficient flexibility to predict a wide range of completeness levels at a given registered crude death rate. the method can be applied utilising data readily available at the subnational level, and can be used to assess completeness of deaths reported from health facilities, censuses and surveys. its utility is diminished where the adult mortality rate is unusually high for a given under-five mortality rate. the method overcomes the considerable limitations of existing methods and has considerable potential for widespread application by national and subnational governments.

(2014) proposed a multievent cr model that allows dispersal to be estimated while omitting site identity by distinguishing between individuals that stay and individuals that move. more recently, cayuela et al. (2017) extended this model to allow survival and dispersal probabilities to differ for the different types of habitat represented by several sites within a study area. yet in both of these modeling systems, the state of sites is assumed to be static over time, which is not a realistic assumption in dynamic landscapes. for that purpose, we generalized the multievent cr model proposed by cayuela et al. (2017) to allow the estimation of dispersal, survival and recapture probabilities when a site may appear or disappear over time (model 1) or when the characteristics of a site fluctuate over space and time (model 2). this paper first presents these two new modeling systems, and then provides an illustration of their efficacy and usefulness by applying them to simulated cr data and data collected on two metapopulations of amphibians. model 1 was tested using cr data recorded on a metapopulation of yellow-bellied toads (bombina variegata). in this first empirical case, we examined whether the drying-out dynamics of ponds and the past dispersal status of an individual might affect dispersal behavior. our study revealed that the probability of facultative dispersal (i.e., from a pond group that remained available/flooded) fluctuated between years and was higher in individuals that had previously dispersed. model 2 was tested using cr data collected on a metapopulation of great crested newts (triturus cristatus). in this second empirical example, we investigated whether the density of alpine newts (ichthyosaura alpestris), a potential competitor, might affect the dispersal and survival of the crested newt. our study revealed that the departure rate was lower in ponds with a high density of heterospecifics than in ponds with a low density of heterospecifics at both inter-annual and intra-annual scales. moreover, annual survival was slightly higher in ponds with a high density of heterospecifics. overall, our findings indicate that these multievent cr models provide a highly flexible means of modeling dispersal in dynamic landscapes.

(ecology letters, 12, 93, 2009) on dynamic heterogeneity. model-selection approaches based on information criteria or bayes factors have been used to address this question. here, we suggest that, in addition to model-selection, model-checking methods can provide additional important insights to tackle this issue, as they allow one to evaluate a model's misfit in terms of ecologically meaningful measures. specifically, we propose the use of posterior predictive checks to explicitly assess discrepancies between a model and the data, and we explain how to incorporate model checking into the inferential process used to assess the practical implications of ignoring individual heterogeneity. posterior predictive checking is a straightforward and flexible approach for performing model checks in a bayesian framework that is based on comparisons of observed data to model-generated replications of the data, where parameter uncertainty is incorporated through use of the posterior distribution. if discrepancy measures are chosen carefully and are relevant to the scientific context, posterior predictive checks can provide important information allowing for more efficient model refinement. we illustrate this approach using analyses of vital rates with long-term mark-recapture data for weddell seals and emphasize its utility for identifying shortfalls or successes of a model at representing a biological process or pattern of interest.

ecological;SCR, single-catch;a spatially explicit capture-recapture estimator for single-catch traps;"density estimation; single-catch trap likelihood; spatially explicit capture-recapture; statistical methods";ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"DISTILLER G;BORCHERS DL";single-catch traps are frequently used in live-trapping studies of small mammals. thus far, a likelihood for single-catch traps has proven elusive and usually the likelihood for multicatch traps is used for spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) analyses of such data. previous work found the multicatch likelihood to provide a robust estimator of average density. we build on a recently developed continuous-time model for secr to derive a likelihood for single-catch traps. we use this to develop an estimator based on observed capture times and compare its performance by simulation to that of the multicatch estimator for various scenarios with nonconstant density surfaces. while the multicatch estimator is found to be a surprisingly robust estimator of average density, its performance deteriorates with high trap saturation and increasing density gradients. moreover, it is found to be a poor estimator of the height of the detection function. by contrast, the single-catch estimators of density, distribution, and detection function parameters are found to be unbiased or nearly unbiased in all scenarios considered. this gain comes at the cost of higher variance. if there is no interest in interpreting the detection function parameters themselves, and if density is expected to be fairly constant over the survey region, then the multicatch estimator performs well with single-catch traps. however if accurate estimation of the detection function is of interest, or if density is expected to vary substantially in space, then there is merit in using the single-catch estimator when trap saturation is above about 60%. the estimator's performance is improved if care is taken to place traps so as to span the range of variables that affect animal distribution. as a single-catch likelihood with unknown capture times remains intractable for now, researchers using single-catch traps should aim to incorporate timing devices with their traps.
ecological;SCR, estimation;bayes and empirical bayes estimators of abundance and density from spatial capture-recapture data;NA;PLOS ONE;DORAZIO RM;in capture-recapture and mark-resight surveys, movements of individuals both within and between sampling periods can alter the susceptibility of individuals to detection over the region of sampling. in these circumstances spatially explicit capture-recapture (secr) models, which incorporate the observed locations of individuals, allow population density and abundance to be estimated while accounting for differences in detectability of individuals. in this paper i propose two bayesian secr models, one for the analysis of recaptures observed in trapping arrays and another for the analysis of recaptures observed in area searches. in formulating these models i used distinct submodels to specify the distribution of individual home-range centers and the observable recaptures associated with these individuals. this separation of ecological and observational processes allowed me to derive a formal connection between bayes and empirical bayes estimators of population abundance that has not been established previously. i showed that this connection applies to every poisson point-process model of secr data and provides theoretical support for a previously proposed estimator of abundance based on recaptures in trapping arrays. to illustrate results of both classical and bayesian methods of analysis, i compared bayes and empirical bayes esimates of abundance and density using recaptures from simulated and real populations of animals. real populations included two iconic datasets: recaptures of tigers detected in camera-trap surveys and recaptures of lizards detected in area-search surveys. in the datasets i analyzed, classical and bayesian methods provided similar - and often identical - inferences, which is not surprising given the sample sizes and the noninformative priors used in the analyses.
ecological;SCR, point process, continuous;a hierarchical model for estimating the spatial distribution and abundance of animals detected by continuous-time recorders;NA;PLOS ONE;"DORAZIO RM;KARANTH KU";motivation several spatial capture-recapture (scr) models have been developed to estimate animal abundance by analyzing the detections of individuals in a spatial array of traps. most of these models do not use the actual dates and times of detection, even though this information is readily available when using continuous-time recorders, such as microphones or motion-activated cameras. instead most scr models either partition the period of trap operation into a set of subjectively chosen discrete intervals and ignore multiple detections of the same individual within each interval, or they simply use the frequency of detections during the period of trap operation and ignore the observed times of detection. both practices make inefficient use of potentially important information in the data. model and data analysis we developed a hierarchical scr model to estimate the spatial distribution and abundance of animals detected with continuous-time recorders. our model includes two kinds of point processes: a spatial process to specify the distribution of latent activity centers of individuals within the region of sampling and a temporal process to specify temporal patterns in the detections of individuals. we illustrated this scr model by analyzing spatial and temporal patterns evident in the camera-trap detections of tigers living in and around the nagarahole tiger reserve in india. we also conducted a simulation study to examine the performance of our model when analyzing data sets of greater complexity than the tiger data. benefits our approach provides three important benefits: first, it exploits all of the information in scr data obtained using continuous-time recorders. second, it is sufficiently versatile to allow the effects of both space use and behavior of animals to be specified as functions of covariates that vary over space and time. third, it allows both the spatial distribution and abundance of individuals to be estimated, effectively providing a species distribution model, even in cases where spatial covariates of abundance are unknown or unavailable. we illustrated these benefits in the analysis of our data, which allowed us to quantify differences between nocturnal and diurnal activities of tigers and to estimate their spatial distribution and abundance across the study area. our continuous-time scr model allows an analyst to specify many of the ecological processes thought to be involved in the distribution, movement, and behavior of animals detected in a spatial trapping array of continuous-time recorders. we plan to extend this model to estimate the population dynamics of animals detected during multiple years of scr surveys.

ecological;Social species, assumptions;effects of social organization, trap arrangement and density, sampling scale, and population density on bias in population size estimation using some common mark-recapture estimators;NA;PLOS ONE;"GUPTA M;JOSHI A;VIDYA TNC";mark-recapture estimators are commonly used for population size estimation, and typically yield unbiased estimates for most solitary species with low to moderate home range sizes. however, these methods assume independence of captures among individuals, an assumption that is clearly violated in social species that show fission-fusion dynamics, such as the asian elephant. in the specific case of asian elephants, doubts have been raised about the accuracy of population size estimates. more importantly, the potential problem for the use of mark-recapture methods posed by social organization in general has not been systematically addressed. we developed an individual-based simulation framework to systematically examine the potential effects of type of social organization, as well as other factors such as trap density and arrangement, spatial scale of sampling, and population density, on bias in population sizes estimated by popan, robust design, and robust design with detection heterogeneity. in the present study, we ran simulations with biological, demographic and ecological parameters relevant to asian elephant populations, but the simulation framework is easily extended to address questions relevant to other social species. we collected capture history data from the simulations, and used those data to test for bias in population size estimation. social organization significantly affected bias in most analyses, but the effect sizes were variable, depending on other factors. social organization tended to introduce large bias when trap arrangement was uniform and sampling effort was low. popan clearly outperformed the two robust design models we tested, yielding close to zero bias if traps were arranged at random in the study area, and when population density and trap density were not too low. social organization did not have a major effect on bias for these parameter combinations at which popan gave more or less unbiased population size estimates. therefore, the effect of social organization on bias in population estimation could be removed by using popan with specific parameter combinations, to obtain population size estimates in a social species.
ecological;Social species;a new mark-recapture approach for abundance estimation of social species;NA;PLOS ONE;"HICKEY JR;SOLLMANN R";accurate estimates of population abundance are a critical component of species conservation efforts in order to monitor the potential recovery of populations. capture-mark-recapture (cmr) is a widely used approach to estimate population abundance, yet social species moving in groups violate the assumption of cmr approaches that all individuals in the population are detected independently. we developed a closed cmr model that addresses an important characteristic of group-living species-that individual-detection probability typically is conditional on group detection. henceforth termed the two-step model, this approach first estimates group-detection probability and then-conditional on group detection-estimates individual-detection probability for individuals within detected groups. overall abundance is estimated assuming that undetected groups have the same average group size as detected groups. we compared the performance of this two-step cmr model to a conventional (one-step) closed cmr model that ignored group structure. we assessed model sensitivity to variation in both group- and individual-detection probability. both models returned overall unbiased estimates of abundance, but the one-step model returned deceptively narrow bayesian confidence intervals (bci) that failed to encompass the correct population abundance an average 52% of the time. contrary, under the two-step model, ci coverage was on average 96%. both models had similar root mean squared errors (rmse), except for scenarios with low group detection probability, where the two-step model had much lower rmse. for illustration with a real data set, we applied the two-step and regular model to non-invasive genetic capture-recapture data of mountain gorillas (gorilla beringei beringei). as with simulations, abundance estimates under both models were similar, but the two-step model estimate had a wider confidence interval. results support using the two-step model for species living in constant groups, particularly when group detection probability is low, to reduce risk of bias and adequately portray uncertainty in abundance estimates. important sources of variation in detection need to be incorporated into the two-step model when applying it to field data.

ecological;telemetry;using auxiliary telemetry information to estimate animal density from capture-recapture data;"density; geographic closure; mark-recapture; telemetry";ECOLOGY;"IVAN JS;WHITE GC;SHENK TM";estimation of animal density is fundamental to ecology, and ecologists often pursue density estimates using grids of detectors (e.g., cameras, live traps, hair snags) to sample animals at a study site. however, under such a framework, reliable estimates can be difficult to obtain because animals move on and off of the site during the sampling session (i.e., the site is not closed geographically). generally, practitioners address lack of geographic closure by inflating the area sampled by the detectors based on the mean distance individuals moved between trapping events or invoking hierarchical models in which animal density is assumed to be a spatial point process, and detection is modeled as a declining function of distance to a detector. we provide an alternative in which lack of geographic closure is sampled directly using telemetry, and this auxiliary information is used to compute estimates of density based on a modified huggins closed-capture estimator. contrary to other approaches, this method is free from assumptions regarding the distribution and movement of animals on the landscape, the stationarity of their home ranges, and biases induced by abnormal movements in response to baited detectors. the estimator is freely available in program mark.

(j appl ecol 45: 1228, 2008). the rest model describes the relationship among staying time, trapping rate, and density, which is estimable using a frequentist or bayesian approach. we tested the reliability and feasibility of the rest model using monte carlo simulations. we also applied the approach in the african rainforest and compared the results with those of a line-transect survey. 3. the simulations showed that the rest model provided unbiased estimates of animal density. even when animal movement speeds varied among individuals, and when animals travelled in pairs, the model provided unbiased density estimates. however, the rest model was vulnerable to unsynchronized activity patterns among individuals. moreover, it is necessary to use a camera model with a fast and reliable infrared sensor and to set the camera trap's parameters appropriately (i.e. video length, delay period). the field survey showed that the staying time of two ungulate species in the african rainforest exhibited good fit with a temporal parametric distribution, and the rest model provided density estimates consistent with those of a line-transect survey. 4. synthesis and applications. the random encounter and staying time model provides better efficiency and higher feasibility than the random encounter model in estimating animal density without individual recognition. careful application of the random encounter and staying time model provides the potential to estimate density of many ground-dwelling vertebrates lacking individually recognizable markings, and thus should be an effective method for population monitoring.
ecological;N-mixture, heterogeneity, covariates;partitioning detectability components in populations subject to within-season temporary emigration using binomial mixture models;NA;PLOS ONE;"O DONNELL KM;THOMPSON FR;SEMLITSCH RD";"detectability of individual animals is highly variable and nearly always < 1; imperfect detection must be accounted for to reliably estimate population sizes and trends. hierarchical models can simultaneously estimate abundance and effective detection probability, but there are several different mechanisms that cause variation in detectability. neglecting temporary emigration can lead to biased population estimates because availability and conditional detection probability are confounded. in this study, we extend previous hierarchical binomial mixture models to account for multiple sources of variation in detectability. the state process of the hierarchical model describes ecological mechanisms that generate spatial and temporal patterns in abundance, while the observation model accounts for the imperfect nature of counting individuals due to temporary emigration and false absences. we illustrate our model's potential advantages, including the allowance of temporary emigration between sampling periods, with a case study of southern red-backed salamanders plethodon serratus. we fit our model and a standard binomial mixture model to counts of terrestrial salamanders surveyed at 40 sites during 3-5 surveys each spring and fall 2010-2012. our models generated similar parameter estimates to standard binomial mixture models. aspect was the best predictor of salamander abundance in our case study; abundance increased as aspect became more northeasterly. increased time-since-rainfall strongly decreased salamander surface activity (i.e. availability for sampling), while higher amounts of woody cover objects and rocks increased conditional detection probability (i.e. probability of capture, given an animal is exposed to sampling). by explicitly accounting for both components of detectability, we increased congruence between our statistical modeling and our ecological understanding of the system. we stress the importance of choosing survey locations and protocols that maximize species availability and conditional detection probability to increase population parameter estimate reliability."

(2009b) and this model generated estimates similar to a spatially explicit mark-resight model previously developed for this population during our study. spatially explicit capture-recapture models have become an important tool in ecology and confer a number of advantages; however, non-spatial models that account for inherent individual heterogeneity may perform nearly as well, especially where immigration and emigration are limited. non-spatial models are computationally less demanding, do not make implicit assumptions related to the isotropy of home ranges, and can provide insights with respect to the biological traits of the local population.

ecological;SCR, assumptions;simulation-based validation of spatial capture-recapture models: a case study using mountain lions;NA;PLOS ONE;"PATERSON JT;PROFFITT K;JIMENEZ B;ROTELLA J;GARROTT R";spatial capture-recapture (scr) models have improved the ability to estimate densities of rare and elusive animals. however, scr models have seldom been validated even as model formulations diversify and expand to incorporate new sampling methods and/or additional sources of information on model parameters. information on the relationship between encounter probabilities, sources of additional information, and the reliability of density estimates, is rare but crucial to assessing reliability of scr-based estimates. we used a simulation-based approach that incorporated prior empirical work to assess the accuracy and precision of density estimates from scr models using spatially unstructured sampling. to assess the consequences of sparse data and potential sources of bias, we simulated data under six scenarios corresponding to three different levels of search effort and two levels of correlation between search effort and animal density. we then estimated density for each scenario using four models that included increasing amounts of information from harvested individuals and telemetry to evaluate the impact of additional sources of information. model results were sensitive to the quantity of available information: density estimates based on low search effort were biased high and imprecise, whereas estimates based on high search effort were unbiased and precise. a correlation between search effort and animal density resulted in a positive bias in density estimates, though the bias decreased with increasingly informative datasets. adding information from harvested individuals and telemetered individuals improved density estimates based on low and moderate effort but had negligible impact for datasets resulting from high effort. we demonstrated that density estimates from scr models using spatially unstructured sampling are reliable when sufficient information is provided. accurate density estimates can result if empirical-based simulations such as those presented here are used to develop study designs with appropriate amounts of effort and information sources.

ecological;HMM;modeling trap-awareness and related phenomena in capture-recapture studies;NA;PLOS ONE;"PRADEL R;SANZ AGUILAR A";trap-awareness and related phenomena whereby successive capture events are not independent is a feature of the majority of capture-recapture studies. this phenomenon was up to now difficult to incorporate in open population models and most authors have chosen to neglect it although this may have damaging consequences. focusing on the situation where animals exhibit a trap response at the occasion immediately following one where they have been trapped but revert to their original naive state if they are missed once, we show that trap-dependence is more naturally viewed as a state transition and is amenable to the current models of capture-recapture. this approach has the potential to accommodate lasting or progressively waning trap effects.
ecological;SCR;a spatial capture-recapture model to estimate fish survival and location from linear continuous monitoring arrays;NA;CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES;"RAABE JK;GARDNER B;HIGHTOWER JE";we developed a spatial capture-recapture model to evaluate survival and activity centres (i.e., mean locations) of tagged individuals detected along a linear array. our spatially explicit version of the cormack-jolly-seber model, analyzed using a bayesian framework, correlates movement between periods and can incorporate environmental or other covariates. we demonstrate the model using 2010 data for anadromous american shad (alosa sapidissima) tagged with passive integrated transponders (pit) at a weir near the mouth of a north carolina river and passively monitored with an upstream array of pit antennas. the river channel constrained migrations, resulting in linear, one-dimensional encounter histories that included both weir captures and antenna detections. individual activity centres in a given time period were a function of the individual's previous estimated location and the river conditions (i.e., gage height). model results indicate high within-river spawning mortality (mean weekly survival = 0.80) and more extensive movements during elevated river conditions. this model is applicable for any linear array (e. g., rivers, shorelines, and corridors), opening new opportunities to study demographic parameters, movement or migration, and habitat use.

ecological;Batch marking;integrating batch marks and radio tags to estimate the size of a closed population with a movement model;"batch-marking; capture-recapture; movement";ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION;"SCHWARZ CJ;COPE S;FRATTON G";movement models require individually identifiable marks to estimate the movement rates among strata. but they are relatively expensive to apply and monitor. batch marks can be readily applied, but individual animal movements cannot be identified. we describe a method to estimate population size in a stratified population when movement takes place among strata and animals are marked with a combination of batch and individually identifiable tags. a hierarchical model with bayesian inference is developed that pools information across segments on the detection efficiency based on radio-tagged fish and also uses the movement of the radio-tagged fish to impute the movement of the batch-marked fish to provide estimates of the population size on a segment and river level. the batch marks provide important information to help estimate the movement rates, but contribute little to the overall estimate of the population size. in this case, the approximate equal catchability among strata in either sample obviates the need for stratification.

ecological;SCR, assumptions;how does spatial study design influence density estimates from spatial capture-recapture models?;NA;PLOS ONE;"SOLLMANN R;GARDNER B;BELANT JL";when estimating population density from data collected on non-invasive detector arrays, recently developed spatial capture-recapture (scr) models present an advance over non-spatial models by accounting for individual movement. while these models should be more robust to changes in trapping designs, they have not been well tested. here we investigate how the spatial arrangement and size of the trapping array influence parameter estimates for scr models. we analysed black bear data collected with 123 hair snares with an scr model accounting for differences in detection and movement between sexes and across the trapping occasions. to see how the size of the trap array and trap dispersion influence parameter estimates, we repeated analysis for data from subsets of traps: 50% chosen at random, 50% in the centre of the array and 20% in the south of the array. additionally, we simulated and analysed data under a suite of trap designs and home range sizes. in the black bear study, we found that results were similar across trap arrays, except when only 20% of the array was used. black bear density was approximately 10 individuals per 100 km(2). our simulation study showed that scr models performed well as long as the extent of the trap array was similar to or larger than the extent of individual movement during the study period, and movement was at least half the distance between traps. scr models performed well across a range of spatial trap setups and animal movements. contrary to non-spatial capture-recapture models, they do not require the trapping grid to cover an area several times the average home range of the studied species. this renders scr models more appropriate for the study of wide-ranging mammals and more flexible to design studies targeting multiple species.

ecological;SCR, assumptions;trap configuration and spacing influences parameter estimates in spatial capture-recapture models;NA;PLOS ONE;"SUN CC;FULLER AK;ROYLE JA";an increasing number of studies employ spatial capture-recapture models to estimate population size, but there has been limited research on how different spatial sampling designs and trap configurations influence parameter estimators. spatial capture-recapture models provide an advantage over non-spatial models by explicitly accounting for heterogeneous detection probabilities among individuals that arise due to the spatial organization of individuals relative to sampling devices. we simulated black bear (ursus americanus) populations and spatial capture-recapture data to evaluate the influence of trap configuration and trap spacing on estimates of population size and a spatial scale parameter, sigma, that relates to home range size. we varied detection probability and home range size, and considered three trap configurations common to large-mammal mark-recapture studies: regular spacing, clustered, and a temporal sequence of different cluster configurations (i.e., trap relocation). we explored trap spacing and number of traps per cluster by varying the number of traps. the clustered arrangement performed well when detection rates were low, and provides for easier field implementation than the sequential trap arrangement. however, performance differences between trap configurations diminished as home range size increased. our simulations suggest it is important to consider trap spacing relative to home range sizes, with traps ideally spaced no more than twice the spatial scale parameter. while spatial capture-recapture models can accommodate different sampling designs and still estimate parameters with accuracy and precision, our simulations demonstrate that aspects of sampling design, namely trap configuration and spacing, must consider study area size, ranges of individual movement, and home range sizes in the study population.

ecological;SCR, data combination;data integration for inference about spatial processes: a model-based approach to test and account for data inconsistency;NA;PLOS ONE;"TENAN S;PEDRINI P;BRAGALANTI N;GROFF C;SUTHERLAND C";recently-developed methods that integrate multiple data sources arising from the same ecological processes have typically utilized structured data from well-defined sampling protocols (e.g., capture-recapture and telemetry). despite this new methodological focus, the value of opportunistic data for improving inference about spatial ecological processes is unclear and, perhaps more importantly, no procedures are available to formally test whether parameter estimates are consistent across data sources and whether they are suitable for integration. using data collected on the reintroduced brown bear population in the italian alps, a population of conservation importance, we combined data from three sources: traditional spatial capture-recapture data, telemetry data, and opportunistic data. we developed a fully integrated spatial capture-recapture (scr) model that included a model-based test for data consistency to first compare model estimates using different combinations of data, and then, by acknowledging data-type differences, evaluate parameter consistency. we demonstrate that opportunistic data lend itself naturally to integration within the scr framework and highlight the value of opportunistic data for improving inference about space use and population size. this is particularly relevant in studies of rare or elusive species, where the number of spatial encounters is usually small and where additional observations are of high value. in addition, our results highlight the importance of testing and accounting for inconsistencies in spatial information from structured and unstructured data so as to avoid the risk of spurious or averaged estimates of space use and consequently, of population size. our work supports the use of a single modeling framework to combine spatially-referenced data while also accounting for parameter consistency.

(c) 2017 the wildlife society. estimates of population abundance from multiple encounters of marked individuals are biased low when individual heterogeneity of encounter probabilities is not accounted for in the estimator. through computer simulations, we found that the huggins logit-normal estimator with gaussian-hermite quadrature to integrate out individual random effects eliminates major bias of the abundance estimates with an adequate number of sampling occasions and reasonable detection probabilities."

ecological;Misidentification;effects of photo and genotype-based misidentification error on estimates of survival, detection and state transition using multistate survival models;NA;PLOS ONE;"WINIARSKI KJ;MCGARIGAL K";we simulated multistate capture histories (chs) by varying state survival (phi), detection (p) and transition (psi), number of total capture occasions and releases per capture occasion and then modified these scenarios to mimic false rejection error (fre), a common misidentification error, resulting from the failure to match samples of the same individual. we then fit a multistate model and estimated accuracy, bias and precision of state-specific phi, p and psi to better understand the effects of fre on different simulation scenarios. as expected, phi, and p, decreased in accuracy with fre, with lower accuracy when chs were simulated under a shorter-term study and a lower number of releases per capture occasion (lower sample size). accuracy of. estimates were robust to fre except in those ch scenarios simulated using low sample size. the effect of fre on bias was not consistent among parameters and differed by ch scenario. as expected, phi was negatively biased with increased fre (except for the low. low p ch scenario simulated with a low sample size), but we found that the magnitude of bias differed by scenario (high p ch scenarios were more negatively biased). state transition was relatively unbiased, except for the low p ch scenarios simulated with a low sample size, which were positively biased with fre, and high p ch scenarios simulated with a low sample size. the effect of fre on precision was not consistent among parameters and differed by scenario and sample size. precision of phi decreased with fre and was lowest with the low phi low p ch scenarios. precision of p estimates also decreased with fre under all scenarios, except the low phi high p ch scenarios. however, precision of psi increased with fre, except for those ch scenarios simulated with a low sample size. our results demonstrate how fre leads to loss of accuracy in parameter estimates in a multistate model with the exception of. when estimated using an adequate sample size.
